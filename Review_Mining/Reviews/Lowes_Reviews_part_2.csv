good,"The front end was either extremely busy or slow. There was very little middle ground. I learned a lot about handling customers, time management and communication skills. I also had to learn several computer systems while there. You have to learn to speak up in Lowe's or you will be overlooked in training. There was definitely two groups the ones who knew everything and were allowed behind the service desk and the ones who were not trained as well and were always sent to a different location. I had a good set of head cashiers who knew what they were doing, were willing to help and were hardworking. There were some good and some bad managers. The company did a lot for us as far as events, carnivals and stuff like that."
good,"management was ok."
good,"If you are young and going to school work the weekend shift at lowes RDC 960. You will lose your weekends but for the openness for school, it cannot be beaten."
good,Lowe's hires part timers then they reduce you down to 10 hours a week minimum call it customer employee centric program work life. Yeah you will be live life a minimum. And Don't matter if you've been here 2 years or 6 years your part you might not get minimum hours up to 25 hours if your lucky.
good,"Need to respect employees thoughts, need cleaner back room and more help on front end to assist customers more and better delivery trucks also need more security"
good,Store Management is big on Ideas but the execution of the ideas lacks stratagy and follow through.  Tons of potential to be a company to grow with and make a career out of.  Just needs the correct leadership to be more successful.
good,Working at Lowe's is a good starting point for someone that doesn't have much prior work experience and wants a good starting point or a short term job during school breaks or to subsidize another job.
good,"When I started, this was a great place to work. Fun people to work with and plenty of things to keep yourself busy. Customer service skills are easy to learn here. Towards the end of my time there, some major changes to management were coming down the line from up top. And they didn't make much sense other than to cut costs. Seems like it would make work more difficult, although I left before I was able to experience the changes."
good,"At Lowes, you are asked to put the customer first, keep store clean, and the shelves stocked. There is always more work to do that time in the day.  Department are always short staffed.  There is plenty of opportunity to learn and advance for some."
good,Great place to work if you are upper management.   Holding regular team members accountable hardly ever occurs.  Middle management takes all the blame.
good,"Lowe's is a good company however even though managers were pleasant information given about rules was different depending on who you asked."
good,On a typical day we have a steady flow of customers and not enough cashiers.  I learned that people can be down right rude and lie just to get something free.  I believe in respect.  It makes a difference how an outcome will turn out. I do not like being accused of something i did not say or do.  Plus being cussed at for no reason.  But with that being said I enjoy all the other wonderful people who make my day.  The laughters and smiles makes my job all worth it. Customer satisfaction.
good,"When I first started the sense of team work and responsibility for day to day work was the norm.  Employees had responsibilities and some say in how they got them done as long as the planogram was followed and customers were served.  In my area I was expected to be creative as the planogram wasn't always executable in our small space. When I left creativity with the goal of selling more product was taken away across the board from all associates in my position. When I first started, I had plenty of seasonal help needed to do a good job. When I left I was pretty much by myself.   That's part of the reason why and little was being done. I had managed to get the work done. Streesfully with lots of OT. A bigger problem for all of us was that we expected to do more with less - direction, encouragement, real team, and say in getting work done.  Good people left because of; out of touch manager directions, regular 'doing your job wrong etc.', hollow team talk to stressed unsupported associates, new ""productive"" directions were blanketed across all, often unique, stores. I often encoraged associates and provided the compliments so woefully missing. We were expected to not think was a common upset associates shared with me.  My criticism  aside there are exceptions as with all generalities.  I don't talk though through my hat.  I've been in retail as a retail store owner, manager of retail crews in others, and a customer service trainer. I came to Lowe's in retirement to do something I loved.  I believe as Lowe's becomes more frightened of the Internet, stores will continue their slide"
good,"While it is not my ideal workplace, Lowes has plenty to offer for those looking for a managerial position or part-time for good pay. Fast-paced work in peak season and lower stress in the slow season."
good,"I worked as a customer service cashier at Lowe's and at times it was so hectic due to having to answer phone calls, help customers with returns/exchanges or purchase plus complaints and special orders all at the same time with little to no help due to work hours being cut and understaffed. Some of the managers didn't want to be bothered with phone calls or customers. Moral was not great due to the store being understaffed and most of the full-timers having to cover multiple departments with no help from management."
good,Low pay good benefits. Sick and holiday time for full timers. 3 weeks vacation after 5 years. Mid level mngrs are fluid. Rotation of work and off days. Impossible to work a second job unless it is your second job and you are part time.
good,"I'd love to give a good report for Lowe's in Mansfield because it truly was a good place to work if everything was done the way it was supposed to be but we were so short staffed that nothing could get done! Management holds nobody accountable, unless you're actually reliable which makes no sense. I was a head cashier and my manager was absolutely horrible about scheduling people outside of their availability, leaving gaps all through the schedule. We were constantly short cashiers and she constantly makes excuses and promised it would get better but it never did. When confronted, she never owned up to her mistakes. It was a constant problem. Management was unreliable. Never answered their phones when you needed them to and never helped when they know you were struggling. Store manager just as bad."
good,"I did not enjoy my time working at Lowes. It wasn't terrible, but the people who I worked with were very dry and boring. It's not the best place to work at if you're young, but if you need benefits and are older than it works out."
good,Lowe's is a company still struggling to find its identity. The organization has hemorrhaged talent over the past few years and has had difficulty implementing plans due to this. Make no mistake the company is still operating on a solid business model however the future vision for Lowe's is concerning and I would caution anyone looking at them as a potential employer to be wary of the silver lining they feed to you during the interview process.
good,They don't train floor employees. Want the cheapest person for the position. They don't train new employees for position that require product knowledge.
good,I did very well at Lowes as a Project Specialist Interiors. However the position was eliminated and I lost my job. I loved working there but it was one of the few we’ll paying jobs at the store level and I could not afford to continue working there in another position.
good,"The hardest part of the job was seeing the disappointment in so many customers because of the lack of staffing in some departments.  Even though there are seasonal employees, many of them call out.  Full time positions are not plentiful usually resulting in people quitting.  At the location where I worked, accountability was not stressed."
good,"Lowe's is going through a lot of changes and has severe problems with Staffing. Management expects you to pick up all the slack. It would seem like more times than not, they throw you to the wolves every day. Overall not a bad place to work depending on your job position."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Lowe's, however their corporate culture was terrible and would cause the management to be overly stressed to ensure they had enough sales.  This created an extremely high turnover rate and constant inconsistency."
good,Good place to work but if you aren't in with certain management they will nit pick everything you do.  If you go to work to work and get paid then this job is for you.
good,Management did not seem to have it all together. It didn't seem like everyone was on the same page most of the time and in the end didn't even know I was leaving.
good,Great for the single person needing a job. As someone who has a family and has to schedule my time with them it is a bit tiresome. Lots of learning experience to come by.
good,"It was okay the hours sometimes was a pain because people would call out and then we would be short handed running around with our heads cut off, and long long lines of customers. The only bad thing was, employees and managers would mark already discounted items down and then  buy the product and add the Lowes discount again. I left because of the amount of internal stealing. Corporate did nothing."
good,"There are better retail jobs out there! I worked outside at 6AM, in the middle of winter, lifting bags of mulch and soil, for the same pay as those inside! Don't do it!"
good,"I worked at Lowe's for 13 years. As a manager, one of the things that I noticed was a certain level of competition, and a sense of being peer watched. Sometimes, my impression, was that some wanted to look for ""gotcha"" moments to elevate themselves. I found very little in the way palpable friendship, but plenty in the way of workplace competition. The only way to accelerate your position would be to make others' jobs easier. This sometimes felt like I placed more importance on trying to be a support for others that I wasn't watching out for myself."
good,The go to place in the area for all you're home improvement and household needs. Staff are always happy to help. They have a great app too for locating items and telling you whether or not it's in stock. Lumber is decent quality though you may need to pick through a few boards before you find one that's good enough for your next project.
good,A typical day at Lowe's can be challenging. There are many different things that compete for your attention and many task to be completed. Multitasking is a must.
good,"great paid work out , long hours , long weeks , busy , poor management , basic store discount , junky trucks  & don't maintain them , high turn over , great pay for driver with no ceiling"
good,"It does get stressful when a lot of people call in but it's fast paced and easy to learn what you need to. They pay is great for the type of work it is and I've never had a coworker that I didn't like. "
good,No job security with changes day to day.  Employees who put 10 plus years in are not appreciated and are overlooked for advanced in their career.  Loved working here for the longest time until changes were being made every few months and you didn't know if you would have a job there still or not.
good,"Employed as Customer Service Representative "
good,"THings are always changing at Lowe's. It is a mix of good and bad. I enjoyed my job very much for years. It allowed me to be part of a creative team, But it is not what I have survived ten years of college to do and it does not pay enough to make a dent in my student loans. It is time to stop working at a job and start building a career."
good,I like to be promoted for good job performance. I was always a team player I was rewarded monthly for donations selling applanices warranty bonus for customer service sells.
good,"A typical day in Lowes receiving was heavily loaded with minimal opportunities for breaks. The shift was from around 4 am to 9 pm on the part-time stocking schedule. The only reason it was so lacked luster was merely that of management. Management in receiving was poorly executed and it showed majorly in the receiving department. The workplace culture was very diverse people of all backgrounds. Aged ranged from people in their 60's to people in there teen's. I did learn a lot from working at Lowes. I was able to get certified on all machinery the job offered. Also, a big take away from the company would have to be the diversity of the employees there was never a dull day on the work sight. The only reason for leaving was because of management. The management at that particular store was terrible. It was a point finger type of environment. No direct leadership caused a big downward spiral to my position."
good,Lowe’s is a great place to work you can learn a lot of different thing about items .. Interact with the customer... enjoy being hands on with others ..
good,I was employed for 13 years and one thing that is certain is that things will change constantly. Change is good when it is in a positive direction but you need to be committed to the direction that you chose and give it a good shot before changing to another plan. No one feels safe/secure in their roles because of the constant change.
good,"Most of the time Head Cashiers are short on cashiers."
good,The work culture is constantly changing and communication lacks between senior management and lower level associates. Directions are not clear. Just dependents which manager is giving the direction.
good,I worked in the Electrical Dept. and really enjoyed it.  There was a lot of ladder work to go up high and bring down overstock.  Management left us alone to help customers.  I learned a lot about electrical situations by visiting with licensed electricians and some veteran employees.
good,"A typical day for me would be come in at 5:30 a.m. I would start by cleaning restrooms. Next, I would take out trash on the outside of the building. Next I would I come back and clean the break room. Then, I clean the training room. Following I mop the hallways and ride the floor buffer to clean the sales floor (about 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes). Along with all of the following, if something breaks down or is not working, I would have to either call someone or put in a work order for it. Also, check the restrooms before and after lunch as well as before I leave for the day."
good,You could find worse places to work if you have to work in retail. The hours were not the same every day or even every week. Days off were never the same.
good,"I honestly can’t say too much bad about the job itself, but my shift was trash! No one knew anything!!!! They told you what they want,,, late with overtime notices,, but overall it’s not a bad place to work IF YOU DONT TALK TO ANYONE!!!!!!!!!"
good,I have worked with the same company for the last 16 years. I enjoy going to work and I love my job. I get along with my co-workers really well. The management team is easy going. Great customer service.
good,"My availability was not completely open, because of college. This had been an issue for two semesters, and this current semester was the worst. It took three weeks for the manager that made my schedule to change it, and the only reason was because I was forced by the store manager to somehow make it more open. Not worth the aggravation."
good,"I have learned a lot, working as a PSI.  the amount of knowledge learned regarding install process in itself, is well worth the time I have given to this position.  I prefer not to speak about the management in detail, just to say that during my time at lowes, most of the management has been supportive.  working retail is always subject to change from one minute to the next, but for the most part the acquaintances have been a positive influence.  the hardest part of this job is to tell the customer we cant help them.  if the job is out of scope through lowes, or they have a 2000k budget, but need 40k worth of work done to their home.  its tough not to get emotionally involved with your clients.  the most enjoyable has to be the letters and the after pictures of their projects, knowing I made a difference in their lives, in some little way"
good,"I have loved working at Lowe's.  In the last 6 months we hired a new CEO and as often happens when there is a change at the top, lots of restructuring happens.  Many programs and positions are being ended and stores have closed in an effort to make the company more profitable.  Unfortunately, my position is one that is being ended.  While I understand the need to make the company more profitable, I feel Lowe's is making too many drastic changes too quick and it is impacting morale."
good,"I worked first and second shift. The pay and benefits were good had a rotating  schedule so at least you knew when you would be off all month. Lowes is a hard working culture of driving sales and doing lots paper work sometimes got in the way of customer service. Customers were supposed to be a focal point and service was not always as  good as it should be , hardly see management in the course of a shift. Breaks are only to be taken in the breakroom not aloud to go outside the store , can only smoke on lunch off of Lowe's property. But the people were really nice."
good,Lowes started off being a great company to work for.  Over the last few years they have changed several times and have cut positions in doing so.  It has personally happened to me twice in the past six months that my position has been eliminated.  People can not give their best or buy into a company when they do not know if their position in the company will exist tomorrow.
good,work some weekends...and junior help is low wage and low performance...a bit much on admin during role and change often to process.  Management ended program after several years.
good,"I had fun working there just don't remember much of my role there because of personal reasons, I do remember working in different places like garden customer service returns lumber cashier"
good,"For me, Lowe's was a good job with good benefits, but I just didn't feel like I had much of a future there.  I was not interested in moving to other departments or moving up to management, so I was happy in my particular role.  However, when I was hired as the full-time receiver in 2012/2013, I started at $13.10 per hour.  When I left in December of last year, I was making $14.05 per hour and my job duties had more than doubled in that time span.  I was willing to take on more work and more responsibilities and never complained about doing so, but I don't feel like I was ever properly compensated for the extra work."
good,"Working at Lowe's as a Sales associate can challenging, as far as helping customers with everyday project's like remodeling a kitchen, having carpet installed to buying a new appliance. All things that can be very time consuming, so your expected to know what your talking about. In the process of a project you build relationships with your customers making sure they love where they shop."
good,"I really liked working at Lowes, especially being up at the customer service desk. After working there for a year, I was wanting to advance in the company by being a Head Cashier or work in the Cash office. My HR would even recommend me jobs and tell me I should apply for them. But every time I applied for those certain jobs, I never got the position. It really depleted my confidence working at that company and gave me the feeling that I was only getting false promises."
good,Managers do not follow through when it comes to discipline. Nothing Is done to nonproductive workers. Unfair pay. Understaffed. Bad scheduling. Needs better management.
good,This job taught me what I'm not looking for in a future position. Managers expect you to accomplish an impossible amount of tasks in a given time period. Maybe the store I was at was just short staffed but the weight of a bearing load was felt for sure.
good,"Worked in a Contract Capacity. Pretty strong culture. Compensation did not match market, but claims to be adequate for other Home Improvement organizations. Decent Management, but let us be self-sustaining."
good,"Lowe's is a very friendly environment with helpful employees, although very competitive and stressful at times. Lowe's is fast paced and cut throat when it comes down to training and doing your job. They give you chances to keep up but are very annoyed when someone is struggling. Management takes out their stress on their employees which makes it hard for new employees to stay long, luckily the nice and helpful employees will help out new hires with tasks enough to help new hires learn the ropes of their job."
good,I like working at my Lowe's Store because it's close to my home. I had a ASM that believed in my talent in Sales that's why I got promoted to become a Kitchen Designer. I just hope he is still here to see how I was able to prove to everyone else that I can be an asset for the company. I was able to be consistent in Top 10th and 25th since I assume my position as a Kitchen Designer this 2018. People at work need Managers like him so Lowe's can have more loyal employees. A simple pat on your shoulder to acknowledge that you did good in your job makes a lot of difference at work. It builds self esteem and creates more respect for everyone.
good,"It didn't feel as if they cared for their employees.  If you are not a favorite to a manager, all your hard work is not noticed.  Trying to grow in the company is all a favoritism game."
good,"Pros: co-workers, pay, communication, cooperation, location."
good,"At times it really felt like there was something to do, the company atmosphere was good and the environment was super friendly. Overall pleasant experience"
good,"Great company,  there were people struggles, at times, but all in all, a positive experience.  The boss however, that was a nightmare of an experience."
good,Working overnights was the downside but it left room to work in peace. Most of the people that work in the nighttime we're nice enough. Main downside was it did not pay much.
good,Good job to get some experience under your belt. No promotion opportunities. Lowes is currently going under reconstruction in its management team. They are going be a customer focus team that will home depot.
good,"Great for a part-time job. Great benefits but no opportunity for advancement! So many reliable, experienced employees are overlooked in favor of hiring managers from other companies. Low-job moral."
good,"A job at Lowe's can be a stepping stone for better things."
good,"Work was slow-paced, pay was decent, and it wasn't to difficult to balance personal time with work hours. I would recommend to a friend who is in college or looking for something temporary."
good,Managers have favorites but other than that it’s not terrible. They don’t really listen to you if you want to switch to a new position within the company.
good,Working with customers was the most enjoyable part of the job.  The hardest part was to hit the budget numbers.  I learned a lot about home improvement.  This was an area that I lacked information on.
good,"When its spring/summer, it is extremley busy and the lines are crazy. They either have not enought people on the job or too many people. During the winter, it gets really boring and slow, and youre just standing around. If your working in customer service, be prepared to be yelled at and deal with angry customers waiting for their product."
good,I was harassed at Lowe's by an ASM and The HR helped her. They would also make fun of employees together.  Even when it was brought to the attention of the DM. Nothing was ever done about it.
good,Lowe's was a fun place to work for and I still want to work for it. But they cap salaries making it difficult to advance and the rotating work schedule make it difficult to find a second job.
good,poor management ruins this place. never know from day to day if you have a job. very unorganized and lack of communication. management has there picks.
good,Worked as a seasonal cashier. Worked only a few days a week and the hours were very flexible. This was my first job so i learned to move in a quick pace and process transactions. Learned to interact with customers as well.
good,"Ensure department is clean and products properly displayed.  Assisting customers with their shopping needs.  Helping new homeowners understand products available to provide window coverings that will enhance the appearance of their new homes."
good,Great employess to work with.  I enjoyed working with customers on projects to help them with their needs.  I’ve enjoyed my 12 plus years.  When the restructure was in place my pay would be $7.00 less per hour
good,"I was with Lowe’s for 10 years, but over the years, Lowe’s as a Company has changed dramatically. The Training Programs are just not there and Support from Management and other Team Members are extremely lacking.  There is no direction and no motivation to do well.  I’ve worked in several locations and the moral changes from store to store. I’ve never once felt valued for the experience and knowledge I brought to the company. Acknowledging and motivating your employees could have a huge impact on Sales and Customer Service and this is not the focus of Lowe’s the way it used to be. "
good,New CEO seems to have Lowe's on right path I hope it works out for the company. The Contact Center is very fast paced high stress environment with very little down time. Salaried workers can expect to work no less than 50 hrs per week and often much more from home.
good,Great job when staffing is correct. Doe's not give staffing the fair chance to succeed. Not enough training for management or sales floor employees. No work life balance as your on a grueling corporate rotation.
good,I love my job.. But hate the schedule.. And I've been working in customer service for 30 years.. My pay and advancement should be better.. I want something that makes me feel like it's been an important day..
good,"Lowes used to be an amazing company to work for that treated its employees with respect and great pay. I am saddened to say that time has pass. Like so many others I am now seeking a change in career due to the changes made within the company that has taken its toll on so many of us. I hope in the future they will adopt their old policies once more, but for now I cannot make ends meet with the pay reductions that they have given to myself and hundreds of my colleagues. We make half of what we used to. And they have terminated many positions that were Necessary for the proper functioning of this company. At twice the work load and half the pay, it has become a very stressful and negative environment. It has taken its toll on all of us. As a lower level employee Lowes has made it VERY clear of its loss of compassion for it's hard working and knowledgeable staff."
good,"As a night stocker at Lowes, there were times that I felt very stressed out. You are expected to completely stock a truck full of product. More often than not we were under staffed."
good,Working here was challenging but somewhat over stressful at times.  Sometimes decisions were based solely on the dollar savings. Overall however the people were great to work with and took pride in their work. I was able to led groups with overseas employees and that was an interesting twist which i had never had the option before. The hardest part was working with people who spoke very little English in some cases and made communication a challenge.The most enjoyable part was leading a group to a successful product implementation..
good,"learned about how to deal with each and every department. days were always busy. management was a unique set of people, ran the store in their own special way."
good,"Under staffed , low retention due to overworked.  And low pay. Upper level management has disconnect from base employees.  Communication problems from one supervisor to another"
good,not a great long term career choice.  lots of lay offs and turn over.  At times could be very stressful with little support from store management.  Good benefits.
good,"Love the people I work with and the customers that can be satisfied. Challenging and a lot more difficult than the Company pays us for."
good,"Lowes is not a bad job to start at if you're beginning to start working. At some points it will stressful, but for the most part it is pretty cool. You will eventually start to learn things at Lowes that will apply for the outside world and that was one of my favorite things about working there."
good,"was a super fun place to work, The only down fall was that the management team didn't care about the bad things at where happening to the good people."
good,"The work itself wasn't terrible, until you factor in that I'm in Florida and the work was outdoors (I worked in the garden department) and it was the middle of spring, going into summer. A week straight was spent loading pallet after pallet of $0.99/bag mulch, dozens and dozens of bags per customer."
good,"A typical work day is pretty fast paced."
good,Mostly friendly people though when management gets stressed they tend to get snippy. This was years ago but all in all it was an alright place to work.
good,"Can be a wonderful place to work, and also very frustrating.  Met some great people at this job, and I have to admit they have been very flexible with my work schedule.  I think their biggest issue is apathy/lethargy and a failure to see the big picture.  They talk a big game about excellence but do little about it.  They on the one hand are very flexible with worker's hours, but in turn do little to put their employees in position to succeed.  It can all be very strange and confusing.  Lack of communication and teamwork is also something they suffer from.  Overall, there are many ups and downs, and in the end, they equal out into being an ok place to work.  I just wish they would strive for more, put words in action and deliver results."
good,"All employees ned to be held accountable."
good,It was a fast paste environment to work in but alot of learnin experience.they teach u new thing's as u grow in the company.only thing is they expect you to finish alot of work in a short amount of time js.
good,"Learned how to sell and wrangle appliances. Not enough staff to assist with replenishing stock, delivery or loading. I enjoyed my work as a kitchen designer, however , they needed one more associate in appliances. Manager laid off the entire night replenishment team and had the day shifts restocking while servicing customers. Probably to save his bonus."
good,It paid okay and it had good benefits but it was a pretty stressful place to work at. It was nice that you were able to kind of where whatever you want the dress code was pretty casual.
good,"My work days could fluctuate between four to fourteen hours a day."
good,"Bad Management good companies to work for need to train management better stop them from lying so much, best about working for this companies is working with customer. never trust the store manager"
good,"If they can get rid of the general manager, the store will pick up in sales, they wouldn't constantly have to hire. Not a very racially diverse store. Need to train managers in empathy"
good,"Lowe's in a good place to work. They have there problems but every place does. You will learn how to deal with customer, how to down stock and how to sell"
good,"Stock "
good,Department managers got the butt and so did some ASM’s and Sales Managers just so CEO could have a better retirement . Lowe’s could have kept these people and taken their title away but they didn’t want to pay them
good,"Lowes is a great company to work for if you are not in management. They take great care of associates with constant company supplied events. If you are a manager do not expect to have a life, You will work over 50 hours a week no set schedule and it will be very stressful."
good,Management continues to under staff all departments. I was unable to give customers my best customer service because of the unrealistic work load.  Management would not address issues I had with a co-worker causing a very poor work envirement.  I was very knowledgeable of Home Decor and I loved working with customers but the stress was too great.
good,I find the atmosphere at LOWE's provides me a good balance of my time. Also for a part-time job I have good benefits and a schedule that fits into my active life.
good,Lowe's has a high turnover rate for store managers and installed.  It was very a  competitive environment and was very stressful for installed sales managers.
good,"Working at Lowes has given me many different types of jobs. This includes working at a cash register, working in the admin office, doing online orders, and working with customers to fulfill their needs. With that being said, I wish management was a lot better than what I had experienced at the locations I have worked at."
good,Lowes is an ever-changing system in policies and procedures. The atmosphere is friendly among peers with a difficult gap between management and staff.
good,i do not have anything to say about Lowes. If you are interesting in working with Lowes then apply and see what happens. you have to see for yourself.  good luck
good,While store management and most store associates are generally decent to work with Corporate Culture chases shareholder money like no tomorrow. During my three years there were constant changes to just about everything. Eventually my position was cut in and outsourced to a third party.
good,got fired for other peoples wrong doings worked myself to the bone. got no praise except when i was a night stocker . im a very clean person and had a talk about my BO  when i had no bo took shower before and after work. got no raise managers played favorites even though i worked my butt off for them
good,It's a great place for some people. But some of the management will not tell u the truth and if they think it will help u they try not to do anything. They do try to help but it dose not fell like help in the end more like pushing u out.
good,"a typical day at work would be going in putting on your vest or name tag, clocking in and talking to head cashier about where you are needed."
good,I would have stayed at Lowes if they had a fulltime position available. I liked that they work as a team in order to get a job done. The hours were ok
good,"Same as everywhere else. understaffed and underpayed more often than not. No bull-pen in the back to put excess freight, so freight would block up aisles in a few departments. Most of the good managers left or quit."
good,"I was fulfillment coordinator when they made the position. In slower stores (like mine), it's extremely boring. The management didn't enforce others doing their job so that fulfillment could do ours. Favoritism in the management was high- if they like you, they keep you and promote you. If not, you're stuck forever with no advancement opportunities. Pay was decent, hours were decent, and I loved who I worked with and the actual job was nice when it wasnt boring."
good,The customers and employees can be rude. The managers are often lazy and unproductive. The store Manager can be very difficult at times. The HR can be very understanding about personal issues.
good,"It was a great place to learn new skills.  Many changes within the organization.  Compression is happening at the organization and the old school typically is the big winner.  New people get frustrated and leave because people don’t like new ideas.  "
good,"The job was great at first, but all the good managers left and the store turned into a complete mess. Employees constantly kept calling in and the salesfloor workers had to be cashiers. So it was like no one was in the store."
good,Was unable to advance within that location. Benefits were good but the overall was not worth returning to that Lowe's location. Most enjoyable part of the job were most co-worker's and especially the returning customer's.
good,"easy to get pegged to a certain department, and difficult to advance with the company.  there are issues with diversity across the organization.  There are many opportunities for cross-training, although movement to accept those positions may not actually occur."
good,"Once you are in the building you are immediately being called upon. You work with associates, customers, computer systems and other management in one area or another. Throughout my time with Lowe's, I learned to believe in myself and learned how to look and work with diverse ways of thinking. The workplace was all the way from entertaining to draining, depending on the pace of the business. The hardest part of the job was work/life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job was the associates."
good,"It was an alright place to work. I enjoyed it yes, but not the place to make a career out of. Needed a full time job with at least 40hrs per week, and with the slow seasons, its hard to get that."
good,Lowes is flexible working schedule. There is no communication among the mangment team. I am not pleased with the way things are run in my particular store.
good,It’ was an ok place to work and at times a little bit confusing for me to understand and keep onto top of things some of the people were very nice and others not so much but it was decent work
good,Lowes is a good starter job for young people or that dont mind crazy hours  its not a good work life balance though. Crazy open one day close the next or close 15 days out of the month the managers are a bit power trippy.
good,my co workers were a good bunch. the management not so much. the schedule was based on the retail climate therefore your personal life took a beating.
good,"My time working there was always fluctuating. Not all Management will not show up in time for when you need them most and by the time they get there the customer is even more upset. Bathrooms wreak and make people feel sick. The balance between good, honest and hardworking employees is on a thin line with employees that don’t give it their best and will openly avoid, be rude, scare, or even ignore the customer or another employee trying to find help, most of the time sending them on a wild goose chase. There are certain managers who are perfect at their job and will work hard to ensure the customers AND the employees are satisfied, and there are certain managers that don’t try at all or even refuse to help. Some of the management can’t handle the stress which causes everyone else to stress out. The atmosphere of the store feels like you’re standing on a trip wire most of the time because you don’t know if something will go wrong in the store with all of this stored negativity all around. I worked there for 3 years before finally putting in my 2 weeks notice because I couldn’t stand it anymore. It gets to the point to where you don’t feel like you’re doing anything fulfilling and you find yourself not giving it your all and you start to slack off. It’s not the best place for people who can’t handle the stress load, especially if you’re a team player and yet the team your working with twiddles their thumbs. My advice, get the Lowe’s app. It’ll tell you more than what a cashier or associate would tell you."
good,Can’t live on the pay. No performance incentives. Very little training in any department they assign you to. Seems to be unwilling to solve problems or listen to suggestions that would make the department run better.
good,"it's a good job for someone to gain knowledge, (if they choose to apply themselves.)  Its also a good job for part time workers that just need a second income."
good,"Open garden center - safety walk - restocking product - pull phone orders - unload products from trucks - assist customers with product ( price, quality, time of season effectiveness )  Downside of Lowe's is 12 bosses pulling employees into as many directions , high lower mangers  turn over ?  Great employee family"
good,"Working in the Paint and Home Decour Department, I've learned how to work and manage multiple fast paced / heavy flowed departments. The ability to mentally take in and store information is needed for this job, and I enjoyed working for them."
good,"A typical day is stressful and the customers there can be rude. I didnt enjoy the whole ""customer is always right"" viewpoint. The pay was good but getting full time hours was hard"
good,"As Lowes management model has changed in last 2 years,"
good,Management didn't care what the employees did in their departments only cared what receiving was doing we did everbodies jobs they didn't work with us to stock their department
good,Severally understaffed on a daily basis.  Employees were responsible for several different department.  Taking care of the customers individual and lengthy needs became a difficult task on a daily basis when you were covering 4-5 departments.
good,Management had high expectations but only relied on a few employees to get it done. Rest of the department crew were just bodies. The new management structure system has cut any room for advancement in half. You did get two days off in a row on a rotation which was a positive.
good,"Shift times are not consistent. You will need to take initiative if you want to learn about products. Basic retail responsibilities. The workplace is not toxic, but there is an overall feeling of exhaustion and negativity from employees. Management is mixed, some are helpful others are ghosts. There doesn't seem to be much room for internal advancement."
good,"Wasn't horrible, just had to deal with bad management that doesn't care and inconsistent shifts. There is room for advancement and the pay is somewhat descent."
good,My time with Lowe's wasn't always good they didn't train me for my position they just threw me out there in the field and I got hurt my first day was not told about workman's comp and now I can't get what's due to me
good,manager do not back employees up when it comes to enforcing policy i dont have a lot to say i dont want to write thisreview you need totake this part off
good,Pays very well just had some issues while working there. Issues arised and it was difficult to maintain a job in a work environment that was not understanding.
good,I enjoyed learning the whole store and about the many departments there and learning to help the customers with many of their needs.  Advancement was not always a possibility.
good,Lowe's has been a good place to work. I enjoy the team effort we all put forth. I just know that my position is temporary and have to make sure I can have a permanent job.
good,Pretty much though my entire time at Lowes I had to spend half my time in other departments helping people with no one in the the department. then I get in trouble for not being in my department. I worked at night alone we have people to order for the customers and management did not give me the accounts to order
good,"It's not too bad to work at, although you deal with drama from coworkers. Of course it's women who cause the drama. So there is always this negative vibe everytime I'm working. There is a huge lack of communication in the department that I'm working in. This is not a job  that I'll find myself staying very long. It pays beter than previous retail jobs I had. But if it wasn't for the drama, it wouldn't be too bad of a place to work at!"
good,Good work environment. Flexible scheduling of shifts. Every third weekend off. Access to computer training. Very receptive to thoughts and ideas about improvements.
good,"All in all, working at this lowes has been a learning experience in several areas. The management is friendly, as are most if not all of the other employees. You have a chance to learn a bit about the many products that are sold to the customers, and is a good crash course through what retail can often be like. The workplace is often very disorganized in terms of where things are stocked or how they are spread out, but the employees try to keep the building and aisles clean and ready. The only real two complaints are the lack of internal product organization, especially when it comes to the online or technical, and the often inconvenient scheduling system. Other than these two factors, Lowes is full of friendly people willing and waiting to help their customers"
good,"The management at this location really was the downfall of it. Many of the managers never talked to each other about important topics such as scheduling people to help cover other shifts or even hiring people to potentially have covered shifts. there were many times where I would be covering 3 maybe even 4 sections at a time. Also, they would get angry when you didn't take a lunch earlier in the day when the entire place was swamped with customers but wouldn't provide anyone else to cover your section at times so you would be forced to either not take a lunch or get yelled at for not being there and being on lunch. It was a catch 22 of a system and I feel a dedicated hr manager that constantly was hiring quality workers would greatly better the store. The workers themselves were really what made my working experience amazing and enjoyable. they made it worth it to me to come everyday and do the best i could in order to ensure they could also do the same."
good,"A given day might be fast or slow.  There is always something to work on or do, but this often means that on high traffic days work is always 2 steps behind what is supposed to be happening.  Most co-workers are willing to help each other when needed, but the store is regularly under-staffed leaving employees with little time to assist each other."
good,Working there was ok but the management wasn't good at all.I liked my coworkers and the hours.It was ok loading customers merchandise in their vehicle.
good,Most employees work a rotating schedule and only have one weekend a month off. The scheduling of people for many departments provides poor customer service coverage.
good,"I was asked to do a number of different task , from stocking to stacking of wood , to covering other positions in the store , to loading and unloading of trucks that came in and to be aware og safety at all times and to spot for other employees while they were. On the forklift"
good,the sore management needs help. this is one place that if you are good at your job then you are more valuable at that spot then you would with advancing your career. and instead of hold other accountable for job lacking skills they just pile ore on the employee that are great at there job.
good,The customer comes 1st. They will laugh in your face and lie to try to get a discount. Management believes them. Logic is not their strong characteristic
good,"A typical day at lowes is stocking the shelves,checking the status of customers orders and helping customers. While working their I've worked in 6 departments plumbing, garden, paint, home décor, lumber, and appliances. The hardest part about the job is having to work in so many other departments because your department doesn't have the hours ."
good,need better associate training .  Hiring process needs to be more selective .  Company protocol needs to be more to the forefront and not subject to individual interpretation .
good,Lowes was a good place to work. The employees were great to work with. It was a total team effort. Always willing to help each other to get the job done or covering for another persons shift.
good,"A great place to work if you are committed to helping customers. In most cases the customers were very grateful and it was fun. The problem was management. They were lazy and provided no support. When you had a problem and asked for suggestions they said ""figure it out"". Always short staffed and some of the associates were also very lazy. Poor morale throughout the store made working there depressing. Management did not want to hear any suggestions."
good,"Most of the co-workers are helpful. Most managers are reasonable and not too strict. There is a lack of accountability so when things go wrong, no one ever wants to do anything about it."
good,"It's about who you know, not the amount of work you put in. Pay was OK for retail, however, promotions are given to those people they want to fast track."
good,"I worked as a cashier there and, in my experience, that is where I and any other cashier would have stayed indefinitely. There is no advancement at that location."
good,I liked many things about my job itself but the lack of proper training and the lack of communication between management kept it from being a good to great place to work. One other thing I did not care for was their need to continually move people's hour's around. I suppose I could see this with the seasonal temps but permanent folks should be on a steady schedule to help retain them and make living their own lives more uniform.
good,Lowe's is a good place to work with good benefits. They are a fast place distribution center with many stores they supply. some of those stores rely on a delivery a day to keep their shelves stocked. it is a fast paced job and not for those afraid of work.
good,"Phenomenal benefits for full time employees but their rotating schedule is difficult to manage. During a weeks span, you will open at 6am and close till midnight. Management can micro manage at time's and you will often have multiple managers telling you to do different things at one time."
good,"New store manager is setting new unreasonable rules and changes, most managers are poor leaders with the except two. Drama straight out of high school for some dispute being older (in their 40s-60s) there are great people though like in flooring, plumbing, and receiving. My day though is typically smooth and easy unless managers decide to fight over where you work (not literally) moving you around the store wasting time. Someone in the corporate level has partially destroyed  the labeling system, marking certain thing in the incorrect department on a system level, plumbing get credit for various electrical and hardware stock due to corporates failure to notice or care."
good,punched in the morning and dealt with customers in every department and unload freight. Filled in where employees not working in their department.  Cleaning the department at the end of the day for the following morning.
good,Lowe's wasn't a horrible place to work.  The location I worked at had poor management that played favorites.  Certain employees would do all the work while others would pretend it was a country club.
good,It is a below average place to work. Management is not trained well. I love the people I work with but the Management team is not very professional. Not much job advancement.
good,"Lowe's is a good stepping stone, the employees are friendly and helpful. I am responsible of unloading trailers, I handle freight. I am responsible for top stocking merchandise whenever needed. Management could be better."
good,"Overall, not outside of what you should expect as a seasonal employee at a retail store. Still, conditions outside were hot and scheduling often left department short-handed at peak times. Expectations to learn multiple skills; i.e. fork-lift driving, inventory, etc. was also uncomfortable."
good,"Lowe's is a good place to get a start in customer service and working with the public.  As it stands today, I would not plan on moving up in the company, but it is good experience to help someone learn if they are cut out for the retail/service industry."
good,"With the store being closed during my scheduled hours, it was strange. The bosses were a bit biased and there was favoritism but overall, it was a decent job with decent pay and benefits."
good,"Lowes and Home Depot paid about the same, Lows was maybe a dollar less per hour. I worked Monday through Friday 20 hours per week. the manager I worked for wasn't the friendliest but he was pretty experienced and taught you the ropes pretty well.  Customer Interaction was great and gained great skills in assembly of products and of warehouse operations."
good,"The time that i had working for lowe's has taught me some new skills. The job can be a bit stressful at times but challenging yourself is key to keep up the pace. I would recommend talking with managers and long time employees to guide you for the best learning. If you find their way isn't working for you, try it your way and if it works out don't be afraid to share any new ideas on your results."
good,"Very fast paced,if your good at your job which I was they will stretch you thin. I was a forklift driver, a cashier, pro services associate, receptionist, loader, specialist in different departments etc..Hardest part of job was dealing with workplace favoritism from upper management and not being recognized for hard work and advancement over their favorites."
good,overall a typical workday is pretty good. The spring time is hard.  Long hours. High expectations. Management varies by store.  the hardest part of the job is working weekends and holidays when my family is off.
good,"Management could be better. Some stores are better than others with managers. Do not get injured, you will spend your life fighting for a paycheck if you do. Working there is ok as long as you can get coverage. Most of the time you do not have enough though."
good,Delivering appliances and meeting new customers. We were the last ones to interact with the customers if they had a bad experience in the store we could try to change that for a good experience!
good,"I've worked for Lowes a total of 5 years and it's like anywhere, it has its pros and cons, but the customers have a way of making it worth it!  So all in all it's a good company to work for!"
good,"Lowes is focused on employees that are proactive and get things done to create a great experience for there customers. No two days are ever alike. You could be watering plants in the garden center one day, then the next mixing paint."
good,"High paced, requiring a lot of heavy lift and moving of objects.  Frequently operated power lift equipment such as the counter balance forklift, narrow aisle reach truck or the order picker"
good,"When I first started at lowes back in 2012 it was fun and we got the work done, when I left in 2017  the structure had changed more like a wal-mart store, understaffed and no possible room for advancement.  it is what it is."
good,When I got the job i had another job at the time so it really made me look at the things I didnt like about lowes in general. Now if someone were unemployed and landed a job at lowes you should look at it as a blessing but to go as far as calling a job at lowes a career is a bet of a stretch
good,Good place to start out working but I couldn't move around into a management position or even technology position. I have enjoyed my time there and now it is time for me to move on into my career field.
good,"Overall, Lowe's is a good employer.  Typical corporate retail environment. Rotating shifts for full-time associates. Good benefits and reasonable salary."
good,"I worked in the paint department.  Generally speaking we were always busy either by stocking shelves or mixing paint, when I was there it was a very physical position."
good,"You have to like working on home projects, painting and gardening. I worked part time, so it worked for me."
good,My job was redundant. I got certified to use all equipment in less than 3 weeks. The department manager was very rude but all the other employees were very nice
good,"Recent corporate changes have made it a difficult place to work. Service/support management too stressed out to care and upper management pile work on the hard workers and let the slackers slide because it's easier than holding them responsible. Special employees seem to be rewarded with set hours and created positions. There's little to no room for advancement. Customers are rude and there's very little management support for fear of corporate complaints. Pay is higher than most local retailers but it's earned.  Corporate keeps slashing payroll and demanding more with less. This leaves associates covering multiple departments which hurts customer service. Lots of perks throughout the year...employee appreciation, celebrations, food provided on busiest days, contests and chances for quarterly bonus."
good,Work long hours and pushed to get work done. They don't care to much about delivery crew just get the work done. Managers could a lot better at their job. Don't worry about getting fired most of the time they don't write people up for anything. Most of the time out on trucks you don't receive a lunch!
good,"Typical customer service job, mostly rude customers, too many responsibilities for min wage. Excepted to do management work. Starting out you are only temp, hard to make the cut to stay and then harder to get a raise."
good,"A typical day at work was about 10 hours and included handling customer issues, employee issues, coaching employees, and ensuring customers received great service."
good,Robert niblock has made some poor management decisions. The new system in place is not working and they will not recognize that it is not good for the customers and the employees.
good,"When I started working at Lowe's management was great as was the corporate culture that emphasized a good work life balance.  I even turned down a 6 figure job offer because the work environment was so good, and I was not making 6 figures at Lowe's."
good,I'm really dissatisfied with IT.because im not getting anywhere there so im trying to get a better paying job an i would like to advance in a job or move up the ladder
good,"I liked the majority of the people that worked at the 3 different stores I worked.  However, it is a retail job so the hours are never consistent and the opportunity for advancement is minimal unless you are willing to relocate.  For a corporation, they came across as more dedicated to family and community, which I liked."
good,Management does not have enough to do. They do not have to order anything for the store. All they have to do is make sure employees do their job and they don't.
good,It was a great experience as far as meeting new people and helping customers love where they live. Also being able to train new associates and watch them grow was exciting for me.
good,There are many different shifts that I have to work at Lowe's.  I would prefer a more steady work shift.  I love everyone I work with I'm just trying to find more of a career and something that will push my potential.  I don't feel like I can grow from Lowe's.
good,As a company its ok for retail.  My biggest issue was the lack of proper compensation during my employment.  At the time I as paid 1/2 time for everything worked over 40 hours (which was mandatory).  The company was sued and settled  in a class action lawsuit several years ago.
good,Lowe's in reinventing itself. The company is trying to stay relevant to our customers in a changing and challenging retail environment. sometimes you feel to many changes are happening in too many different areas to realize the full impact of them. I've been through a couple of course corrections already. Management is over tasked at times and under supported from the corporate level. The workplace is pleasant and the people are nice.
good,Lowe's is a good place to work. Like any retailer the work is fast paced and can be stressful at times. Only down side is that the company is trying to evolve and in my opinion moving in to many different directions at once.
good,Work life balance is garbage. Management never wants to fix in store problems that make delivery extremely stressful and constantly blames drivers for mistakes that happen in store.
good,"LOWES was a great place to work,  they had great benefits and a nice working envorinment."
good,Na you are only a number not a name.  They need to get back to the company they were 20 years ago.   Instead they are getting to be so busy they forget about the people.
good,I was there 15 years and was let go because my work availability changed. Company also restructured right after I left and demoted many people to lower positions. Starting pay and benefits have also been lowered
good,job was great far as being with customers management wasn't the best and being part time wasn't enough to live off of they caped it at 25 hrs after months of 30+ hours
good,Being a supervisor for retail can be rather stressful at times but a great opportunity for career growth.  Im able to meet and interact with a great amount of people.
good,Good place of work for young adults to grasp the concept of a proper and busy work environment. I've meant life time friends at this job that I will forever care for genuinely. Many employees lived in the area of the store which had a positive outcome with the customers and less verbal altercations.
good,Lowe's has great benefits for your family. If you're looking for part or full-time position you're offered benefits. I'm not sure it's suitable for a single parent unless your children are old enough to attend to themselves while you work.
good,"Typical retail part-time experience. Local managers are good people but pay is low, turnover is fairly high compared to other places I have worked (except for Home Depot)."
good,Full time is being pushed out and part time are being added. This does not help with the ongoing demands of the store. More focus needs to be put on the needs of the store.
good,It is a decent place to work fast paced team mentality. It is nice to help people love where they live and where they work. Occasional bonuses are nice and the discount not only in store but in other brands and companies through benefit hub is excellent.
good,"on your feet all the time"
good,"I would prefer not to answer at this time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I still am working here, they need a union................ Good benefits very low pay"
good,I enjoyed working at Lowe's and learned a lot from the company & the people I worked with. I wish relationships from store manager and up were more developed.
good,A typical day would be zoning your department that all product is available. As a sales specialist my job is to get are installed sales and interior design leads. I do think management could be better. Managers at least at my store do not take the time to teach new employees. There is a lack of morale at least in my store. No matter how well you did in sales for the week you would hear nothing from management. One of the hardest things was teaching myself how to work everything on are ancient genesis system. The most enjoyable was talking to are customers and helping them.
good,"I like the people i worked with. However, sometimes the upper management made poor decisions that made no sense. As well as i was paid part time but due to me being one of the more seasoned part timers i worked full time hours and even ran a department my self."
good,the people were nice but I just want something closer to home and the management is terrible. the hardest part of my job was being busy and not having enough people to help with the work load.
good,great place to work if you can handle the managers. Not very easy to advance in any role. Great benefits and pay for the job. 40 hours vacation and floating holidays per year.
good,"I worked with a bunch of friendly people at Lowes, the only problem was the customers I had to help as every customer expected me to be an expert on what I was selling. Even though I wish I was, I lacked the experience needed to tell each customer about every product the store had. It was also terribly difficult to inform a customer that I am not an expert and if they wanted to talk to an expert that they would have to come in at a different time, as many customers were on a strict schedule. Another difficult part about this job was having to cover for other departments, such as plumbing. As a student aspiring to be an electrical engineer, I was happen when I was placed in the electrical department for customer service as I know just enough to get by in there. However, I cannot say the same about plumbing, which I still had to cover every once in a while even though my managers knew I didn't have any experience or knowledge of the department what-so-ever."
good,I got my first forklift license and I have been driving one every sense.  This is a fast pace job and there is a lot of pressure to get things shipped out with no damages
good,"They are really making an effort an employee engagement and showing appreciation. "
good,"I worked up to 40 hours a week, with something different going on everyday. I started as a cashier and was approached within 2 months of being there to see if I would work in the cash office to help out, they saw my past experiences and wonted to give me a chance. I then a couple of months after that applied for and got excepted to be a head cashier. All of this within 2 years."
good,"Environment was friendly management was easy to get along with. Benefits were fair, the pay was low raises were infrequent. I learned a lot about the retail industry and how it operates."
good,I worked at Lowe's as an unloader/loader where i unloaded trucks. Management was terrible and I doubt i will work for Lowe's again. I was scheduled on days that was not on my availability and then counted absent when i didn't show up. They always took at least 15 minutes and sometimes more to unlock the truck so we can get started which puts us behind and it was hard to get a hold of a MOD to get back to unlock it.
good,This is a great job for the college student but for a full time employment. That is another story the management seems to get turned over every couple years. No true leadership.
good,"The Lowe's I briefly worked for had poor management styles and would be impossible to find when they were needed. They would assign a chore list every day that was only possible to complete if you didn't help any customers or did everything poorly. I've heard some Lowe's stores are nice to work for but, not this one for sure."
good,"Working at Lowe's was a not bad job. I had good co-workers. I was out of the store most of the time. Lots of heavy lifting was involved. "
good,"It is better to be seen than heard at Lowe's. If you act like you are doing your job instead of pointing out work issues, you can go far! Definitely learn to think and work on your feet, as opinions/work directions change several times a week if not daily."
good,Work day sucks. Learned that customers are rude. Management did not care. Hardest part was dealing with customers. There is nothing enjoyable working in retail.
good,"i did actually enjoyed working with Lowe's. The people I worked with made it feel like a family environment, but when needed we people would make sure you know whats required of you. They understand that things outside of work happen and they are very helpful about working around life events. "
good,My review was good and I really enjoyed working there. Only issue I had was not enough hours and no room for improvement. I worked with people and I am a team player. thanks
good,"there is little room for growth at the facility I work at.  managers have been at same job for many years.  must relocate for advancement.  Management team can be very lazy at times but expect you to do your very best at all times.  Often, no manager can be found when you have a problem.  Management decisions are slow forthcoming and poorly made."
good,It's an ok place to work if u needed a start in a job. Workplace culture showed favoritism at times.Benefits are great and employees earn a production bonus every month.
good,"fast paced environment,long stressful days. 12 hour shifts with an hour lunch didn't  leave enough time to do much on work days . But you only worked 2 days on 2 days off . Management was lackadaisical about hiring personnel to replace workers who have left the company. lack of pay is the biggest reason why people leave. I personally felt betrayed by Lowe's as I never missed time and gave my very best every day. I'll never understand why they parted ways with me. people are overworked and underpaid there."
good,"Great work environment for the customer engaging employees. When I started, I felt there were way too many managers and supervisors and not enough employees to engage with customers. The tasks that needed to be completed by the team were incomplete or the customers suffered. "
good,Enjoyed work environment when staffed properly. Went through management position cuts and increased responsibility to staff with knowledge but no salary increase. Made it impossible to do job as intended
good,Give us department managers back! There are not enough loyal associates to replace the hard work department managers. And the service managers are trying to maintain 3 departments and do the jobs of asms
good,"Worked in Lowes of Burbank, super busy. They never go by actual policy and tend to not do much. Management is HORRIBLE, including Human Resources, I don't recommend working there, they will use and abuse of you."
good,Most of time I was barely getting any hours and then one of the managers didn't schedule me for a whole two weeks and then lied and said I was on the schedule I just had to wait til it load up. I had called another manager and the manager confirmed that I was never on the schedule. You can't trust those managers.
good,"It’s a great place to work, good money, but management isn’t the greatest. Had bad expierences with coworkers and store manager. Great benefits for long time employees"
good,"The company thrives on personnel that are self starters, in positions of importance. Store hours are long and schedules vary greatly.  There are currently changes in staff and IT.  Associates that i know have an uneasy ""feel"" for the future of the company."
good,The work environment is fast paced .Definitely have alot of impatient customers that you will have to please. Managers are supportive when it comes an irate customer. You will develop good personal relationships with with co workers.
good,"Recently Lowes Corporate made changes in structure. Eliminating Department Managers and some other Management positions. This resulted in loss of some key personnel that went on to other employment. Most of the Management now is new to Lowes and their positions.  "
good,Benefit package is somewhat expensive out of pocket for employees. Company does have a stock option purchase plan and a 401k match. The job can be difficult but for most areas it is a fairly easy job if you are in fair physical condition.
good,"With the removal of department manager position at Lowe's, the jobs have become stressful and employees retention have decline, because employees are looking for employment else where and no good employee is applying."
good,"I've been there less than two years and had 4 managers even though I've been in the same position.  We are constantly reorganizing and moving cubicles.  There are a lot of long, corporate and department meetings which make it hard to get work done!"
good,"You get a chance to meet new people every day as well as repeat customers. Some requirements were stressful due to lack of training (filling in for different departments).  "
good,working there was a challenge. there were great people but there were also those that wouldnt hesitate to set you up or backstab you for their own gain. too many orders would be given out but we wouldnt have enough people to handle it. there was too much favoritism at my store where some people would be able to get away with anything while others would get nailed for stupid stuff. didnt recieve proper training but kept getting blamed for stuff even when i wasnt there.
good,"The management team always wanted more accomplished in less time. Changing how the job done.Having to work with new people all    time. Knowing you did your best ,and getting praise for it."
good,Extremely short staffed most of the time and if you know what you are doing the management will take complete advantage of that fact. After the restructure the whole culture changed and now everyone seems very stressed and on edge.
good,"Management in Tyler, TX didn't really personally care about their employees and made it very difficult for their employees to better themselves in their education."
good,I learned that I was the only one in the flooring dept that knew anything about the products. I was hired to Sale product and was required to work 46 hours a week on salary.. When I spent almost all my time loading boxes of flooring material for customers. A job that was supposed to be done by an associate that worked hourly. I ended up with a roll of carpet falling on me. After that the company treated me very poorly!
good,"A great first part time job for a kid out of HS. "
good,Nothing much to say. It's what it is. Every company and the way the do their stuff. I therefore can't judge them or rate them. I will however leave when I get a Better job.
good,Lowes needs to catch people doing things right.My store was very intense .I did enjoy working with customer and being of service to them. Training was a challenge and I found constant changes in operations hard too keep up with!
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work if settling for laid back and good management, the paid was average but can grow over the years. But I was looking for that pays more than 9.50 a hr."
good,Over all I enjoyed my time with Lowe's and each individual store is like a big family. The hardest part of the job was no one store ran like another and as an ASM I could be moved to another store based on the needs of the district. I am grateful for the leadership quality's I learned there and that training showed me the difference between leadership and management.
good,"It was a job available to me when I moved to Oklahoma.  Some people just came to work to stand around and get a pay check.  Others, as myself, considered it not only as employment but as a reflection upon myself and Lowes."
good,Was fun in the sense that you meet new people all the time and there didn't seem to be a huge turnaround rate for the staff at Lowes.  It was nice to get a discount on purchases.
good,"Pulled and unbox my deliveries,inspect my truck,call route myself call my customer with 2hr delivery window.I learned how to operate fork lift.order picker,pallet jack,trow freight stock product,cash registers.The most enjoyable part of my job was providing the best customer service possible,and make sure came back to my store Murrieta"
good,"Training is done, primarily, by computer; then it is trial and error; meaning you better have some experience in retail and customer service before starting to work at Lowe's for they expect you to know what it is you are going to do. The management will not hover over you but they will help you as they can. Most Lowe's employees are part-time employees, working anywhere from 10 to 30 hours per week at retail wages. This helps to keep costs down, which is good for shareholder value; and Lowe's is a good stock to own. So if you like working part-time for retail wages Lowe's is a very good place to work."
good,"This was a young man's job. My position started as a truck loader. "
good,Lowes is a good company to work for if you enjoy retail. management always seems stressed so it flows down onto employees. Busy job but not room for advancement.
good,"Lowe's has begun to forget the people and practices that made it a great company to work for.  Too often, companies try to cut corners to increase profits and in doing so, destroy the work/home life balance for it's employees.  In the process, the hard working employees are worked into the ground, while the lazy and non-engaged continue to progress throughout the company."
good,"A good company to work for, plenty of overtime and a great group of co-workers. The management team however, was not very engaged in the problem solving process with customers or employees."
good,"I start by asking my day time counter part on what took place, what terminals have cash in the drawers, and what if anything will carry over into my shift. Then it is either insanely busy or dead. I take in returns and handle in store and internet orders. Also i direct phone calls to the appropriate departments. Management each have their own specialties. One knows the computer system. one can work any department in the store. another knows everything about plants. But they all cant do everything which i have to work around. Most of the employees are friendly"
good,"I don't enjoy the compensation."
good,"I worked at Lowe's for three years as a p/t weekend employee.  Lowe's offers excellent benefits for even p/t employees, which was the major reason I stayed as long as I did...The pay is minimal, especially for the expensive locale, but adequate for a first job, or retirees in need of medical coverage.  10 % employee discount, coupled with deals on discounted appliances for friends and family helps make the job worthwhile...   "
good,A typical day consists of stocking and helping customers. Management is mostly considerate and helpful. The hardest part of the job is pushing credit cards on people that really don't need\want them. The most joy I derive from my job is taking care of the customers.
good,"I was a cashier. I worked in customer service most of the tine I was responsible for answering phones, pulling up orders, waiting on customers, and making sure that everyone got where they needed to be."
good,"Duties included providing customers with fast, friendly, accurate and safe customer service.  Process retail sale transactions by cash, credit card, gift card or check. Also process transactions for Contractor business and Lowe’s Accounts Receivable (LAR) accounts.  Assist customers with item location within the store, and assist with loading customers’ merchandise into their vehicle when needed.  I am comfortable working in any cashier departments of the store (Front End, Garden, Lumber, etc.)"
good,This job was a great tool for me to develop interpersonal skills needed to compete in this field of sales and service. I enjoyed the technical side of learning the systems I used in my position.
good,Ok place to work people are great cons are low pay and benefits suck no overtime a lot of work for little pay very hard to advance management never agrees people call out alot
good,"Very busy, face paced place to work just the hours do not work for my family - work life balance. There is room for advancement for people who want to pursue those options."
good,"There are both pros and cons about working at Lowes Home Improvement. Sometimes you don't feel like your job is something permanent because they're constantly making changes. We're short handed now after a reconstruction, however the people we do have are what makes the job what it is. The people are great."
good,greeting customers and trying to see what it is they need and try to bring down stock to replenish the shelves with. work place culture is to help your fellow employee if and when they need help.
good,"My experience working with lowes was ok,  i neededmor money and better hrs.  It was a pretty cut throat place to work.  They didn't give very good raises.  The management wasn't good where i worked.  They had good health benefits."
good,Was a decent place to work with friendly employees. Management is a bit hands off at times so it can be stressful. With restructuring this year there is less room for advancement.
good,Hard to work with worry about job insecurity. Management treats team members like unfair. Worked there for 11 years fired on unfair terms. High turn over hiring process.
good,"This company has really gone down hill since I started there 11 years ago.  I used to think there was advancement but with all their recent changes, I dont see much advancement for me."
good,I have nothing to say about the company  They unfairly let me go.  I got hurt on the job and they did nothing to accommodate me.  They work their employees too hard
good,It was good experience for a first job however not a great place if you're looking to make a career out of it. I was able to gain quite a few valuable skills i could use elsewhere however have exhausted the learning curve of these skills.
good,Fun to work and enjoy my coworkers.   Lowe's northwest hwy Dallas tx 75238 I just need fulltime hours. Looking for better pay and job advancements. Looking forward to learning more at a new company.
good,This is only a good job if your are full time or a manager because if you're seasonal like I was they are not going to keep you on a permanent basis to save on money and benefits
good,"Balanced workday with team members"
good,"Enjoy meeting customers and assisting them with there needs. Enjoy working with my co workers, and working as a team. We have great pot lucks and everybody enjoys them."
good,Easy work but pay is not that great and the hours are very long in Management. Good benefits and good people to work with. Since I have left there has been many job cuts.
good,"This was a fair job. The people there were friendly and the customers mostly new what they needed. The management continuously changed which introduced new polices frequently, but it was a good job."
good,"Lowe's is a great company if you are an hourly employee, except when it comes to a work life balance.  Employees are required to work any hours needed between 6am and 10pm.  Management are required to work very long days, minimum of 10.5 hours each day 5 days a week. The hardest part of the job is work life balance."
good,they won't send you on your breaks customers rude managers will not adjust to your availability by word of mouth have to submit to them in writing I wouldn't suggest to anyone unless they are just starting out to work first job or something
good,"The best way I can describe Lowes is that every store is different can vary greatly in all aspects of each store. So no matter what you read or hear, it's probably going to be a different experience altogether for you."
good,"A standard day was very fast paced with a lot of customers coming in and out of your department. One downside to the job was the unequal treatment between employees. Learned fork lift and order picker skills along with customer service, stocking, and inventory control. The hardest part of he job was locating lost inventory, but the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. You meet so many different people who come from all different walks of life. It was truly great to interact and help these people complete their projects."
good,"The money and hours are good, most of the time but the managers could be a little less hypocritical. Coworkers were mostly great, had a few slackers, bosses didn't care."
good,"Standing for duration of work time"
good,"A typical workday is usually steady. The management could be better however when you need something there's an response like they don't want to do their job. the enjoyable part is the employees, some of them. and there is not a hard part besides dealing with unhappy customers. I have been at this job 1 yr and 3mnths and has not received a raise or been asked to convert to a FULL TIME employee."
good,Good company to move up and have a career with.  Hard to spend family time with your loved ones.  Treat most of there employees fairly and give them fair opportunity to move up.
good,A typical day of work would be to clock n and log in then start answering phones in order to make sales and meet a specific quota. The hardest part of the job was meeting the quota.
good,"-A typical day at work consists of checking emails, listening to voicemail, file paper work of new projects, following up with customer's to see if they are satisfied with the completion of their jobs, solve any issues that happened with the job, and ensure that the installers are paid if the job is completed."
good,"constant walking to locate product,learned customer communication skills.At times very difficult to focus to many managers in charge,work culture was cool when i first started wasn't that many African Americans their."
good,Balanced work life  Good company to work for if you like fast paced retail and have superior customer service skills. As company is focused around customer service
good,"Good experience working with customers to help them love where they live! I learned allot about plumbing, paint, home decor, hardware, millwork, lumber, outdoor per equipment and the garden center."
good,Pay and benefits were good but lack of attention from management and with restructuring no place to advance and they took away monthly meals wouldn't recommend
good,They have completely changed since I left. So I have no insight into the current work place. They were a good company that changed the entire structure in the stores...lost or are losing many people.
good,"I was frustrated at times because in my previous jobs I had held management & ownership positions and I never felt I would be promoted because of my age.  They tended to hire young employees for management-many of which did not have management training."
good,"Lowe's is great part time employer. They teach you a lot of useful information in the area you are assigned. "
good,"Lowe's was a great company to work for, however the store I worked at was not that enjoyable. This was because we were one of the busiest stores and we had a skeleton crew and were expected to not have overtime and mistakes. Overtime and burnout quickly became the normal. Store management just eliminated all deliveries positions."
good,"I worked here for over a year and even though I was the most qualified to get a promotion, I was denied because I did well at my current position. Pay was ok, hours flexible, part time health benefits is a good option."
good,"Lowe's is a good company to work for. The company is trying to figure out how to compete in the current marketplace, and with that effort there is a lot of restructuring currently going on."
good,"A typical day's responsibilies:responding to customer inquiries, providing support throughout their shopping experience including promoting customer loyalty plans and/or extended protection/replacement plans, processing sales and returns using a cash register, and addressing customer complaints. Also responsible for  identifying and selling products based on customer needs, including credit cards, installations, add-on sales, and explaining warranties, product features, and benefits. This Job also includes inputting, accessing, modifying, or outputting information."
good,I quit my job there due to some very rude employees after an accident involving a fatality occurred I was ridiculed and made fun of like someone dying was a joke to them
good,"It was an ok place to work at. My coworkers made it fun, but the security of the job wasn't too well. I was told to look for a different job because they could just tell you you're fired without no notice."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's Home Improvement. As an assembler I was exposed to many departments. As most places, some of the management team was better than others."
good,My experience changed when I changed stores from OK to WTF. Management does not care one iota about their delivery drivers and are willing to sacrifice your health and safety to save their own butt...
good,A typical work day would require me getting to work at 6:30 am.Preparing my loads for the day communicating with the customers over the phone. Getting the 20 foot flat bed truck loaded inspecting the truck and begin to make deliveries until I was finished with all my deliveries.
good,"Depending on management, this can be a good or bad place to work. Ive had personal troubles with people who are there. As long as everyone is respectful it should be fine."
good,Great place to gain experience and learn a lot about the retail business. You get to be in contact with a lot of higher up people from time to time. So you gain the experience of working with different levels of employees.
good,Lowe's is a good organization with good people. The management really cares and employees are treated fairly. I would recommend Lowe's for employment for anyone.
good,"I think the concept of Lowes is great however when it comes down to it money seems to be all that matters. I think the effort is there. too many chiefs BUT now got rid of managers, made things worse. Not sure where Lowes is going. Need more employee recognition and Corporate Schedule system is horrible! Need to make employees feel like they have some control over their environment. Customer Service trumps EVERYTHING. That can be good AND bad. Management in the store does not listen to their employees concerns at all and lets slackers stay which doesn't make sense for the hard working people. The pay increases are AWFUL. Yes there is the typical standard measly pay but there should be reviews and if an employee is doing s good job then a larger pay increase is what is needed!! Keep the good people and your company will succeed care about your employees more and culture."
good,"I've enjoyed working at Lowes, mostly due to my co-workers. They make the job! I've also enjoyed many opportunities to learn, and there is A LOT to learn in order to do your job well. The work is physically demanding but keeps me in shape. Recent restructuring has really taken its toll on overall morale. It seems we are forever short-handed, which also takes a toll."
good,I work in appliances on equipment so my day is pretty easy depending on what task I have to do. Management is friendly and caring to all employees. We promote safety in the workplace everyday. The hardest part of the job is wanting to stay inside when the weather is great outside.
good,If retail is something you enjoy it is a great company. Very helpful management team. They look to improve their employees and retain quality individuals.
good,open or close store handle daily business handle all customer complaints work with employees on training and product knowledge had to be ready for anything and be able to multi task at any given time
good,"Usually worked out in the garden area as a cashier. I Learned there were way too many Chiefs and not enough Indians.  I never really knew what position ""management"" was responsible for.  As a cashier there was many limitations on the computer that would entail waiting for a manager to over ride.  Very unorganized.  The workplace was nothing but a huge complaint session/and or down grading other employees etc.  Not a fun environment.  In fact felt like a prison as most the time you couldn't move anywhere and you weren't really to communicate with other employees.  The hardest part was working with their system that was not very user friendly.  Most enjoyable part of the job was I saw a lot of friends that came into the store"
good,The hierarchy of management tends to only have leadership skills without have an actual leaders capacity for direction resulting in a lot of mismanagement of human resources and counterproductive back and forth of one manager over another in the convoluted chain of command that their flawed system supports.
good,"It's a great place to work at back in the days great pay raises, but now with the new structure and the way they promote.. It's really not about what you know anymore, but who you know to move up in the company."
good,Management expects employees to work harder then normal without giving proper credit for doing a good job.  There is no set schedule and the 4 week rotation does not always include more then 1 day off in a row making a work life balance difficult
good,Management was poorly structured. Nobody was ever on the same page as far as management goes. Had great co installers. everyone of us was always willing to help one another
good,"Advancement and career opportunities are limited once on the night shift.(9pm - 6am)."
good,This was probably my store for the most part but we cycled through ASM's a good bit and the store director could not have cared less about the store. He let it fall apart and just when I left  it was starting to rebound.
good,"I personally feel that if your goal ,for working,is money first then job satisfaction then Lowes is not the place to work.The hourly pay would not be something that I believe would support a life style where you could raise a young family and maintain a home comfortably. That's why you see a fair amount of older employees at Lowes. They are either on  Social Security and a retirement pension or some other form of additional income.   It is job that offers a little extra income for you but I certainly would not have chose this as a career for raising my family when I was younger. Just simply not enough  $ and not enough job satisfaction for my taste."
good,Not good when store management is never around to help or when they are they don't have answers. They run a limited crew and guest get up set when they can't find anyone around to help them with items or questions
good,"Store environment has changed dramatically since I was hired five+ years ago. With the massive layoffs, and terminations, employee morale has dropped to an all time low. "
good,"The only thing I've noticed with Lowe's is that they love to hire ""Peak"" associates. They will hire you for a certain amount of months, and if they like you, they will renew your contract as a Peak associate AGAIN instead of a part-timer, to avoid giving your company benefits or any sort of Job Security."
good,They lack communication between management and associates on daily activities and scheduling. Poor training on product and processes and poor customer service.
good,"Overall a good opportunity for somone who can handle multi tasking and numerous interruptions. Seeing a task through is sometimes difficult. Some departments are busier than others and it always seems there are not enough associates to handle the volume of customers effectively. This leads to a lot of stress and unhappy customers. Management are stretched way too thin, but do the best they can given the restraints of the situation. The technology and system are archaic and extremely clunky and waste alot of time and customers patience. Lots of opportunities here."
good,"At Lowe's distribution center I learn to operate stand up forklifts, electric pallet jacks, sherry pickers and high reach. I learn the skills of leading and of loading in shipping and receiving deportment."
good,I learned a lot from working at this company because I never had a job working outside. So basically working all day with customers asking me questions about products I will still learning is very challenging I must.
good,"Health benefits are great but management is lacking, Scheduling needs improvement, Too much pressure is placed upon associates. Management excepts great sales but does not provide employees with enough time to provide excellent customer service to customers."
good,"I worked here as a CSA rep loading and pulling orders for the next day, walking customers out to there cars and helping them load up the cars with heavy items and assisted on commercial deliveries as well."
good,"I have been fortunate to have worked at two different locations with this company. It maybe the region, but the first store was excellent. The store always exceeded it goals and there were production incentive there like quarterly bonus when we met project sales plans and we always met and exceeded the projections. Sadly the other store failed miserably in reaching projections, store appearance, retention and moral as a culture. Management appeared to lack proper judgement on issues, moral and true appreciation for work achievements."
good,"Depending what department you are in, you will be helping customers. Loading items into customer vehicles. Work life balance is horrible here. Days off request are usually denied."
good,"It's a retail position, pretty similar to most of them. Good relationship with colleagues, overall a pretty positive experience. Good place for someone straight out of high school or college students looking for a summer job."
good,Just not enough hours for the degree I have.  I work a lot of late hours and most weekends. There are times I don't get off until 10pm and have to be at work at 7am. I've worked retail for so long I am just ready to work a job pertaining to my degree.
good,"Lowe's is a good company to work for that provides good benefits. There are many different jobs within the store, but retail hours can be cumbersome. Great place for a second job as well."
good,No Security is Poor as the Recent Layoffs.. This Company on Cares about their customersover its employees.. Managers are clueless when basic CSAs know more about Certain Departments Than Assistant Managers. Not saying every store is operated the same. But its terrible. They give the customer whatever they want and walk on the Employees.Hence the most recent massive layoff of some Veteran employees
good,"A great place to work, but is going through some transitions which can make some feel uneasy. Everything will sort itself out and will once again, be a great company to work for."
good,learned a great deal  my group of employees great to work with  just seemed like they were weeding out all of the long term people i was just shy of 20 years.  and i didnt agree with the reason behind them letting me go
good,"My experience at Lowe's has been a roller coaster. Like any job, it all depends on your outlook on it, and of course the management. I have seen several Managers (store managers, assistant managers, area managers, department managers etc) come and go. Depending on how well you get along with them will help your everyday experience. I have always tried to never let any one person affect my mood."
good,Nothing much to say it's a ok job to work at not enough full time positions there I wish all the positions were full time with good benefits and a good retirement
good,"limited career advancement, poor mix of work life and personal life,"
good,"Very biases company. The Lowe's I work for tends to pick favorites and only require certain employees to follow part of the handbook, such as dress code, vacation days, days off, call ins - etc."
good,"When I was there we were rewarded for staying safe.You have a set schedule which is a plus. Days, nights, and weekend shift. Which I think is very flexible."
good,"Job can be fun if you make it, or depending on your manager. The company pay and benefits are really good, this maybe the best part of the job. The work life balance for management is terrible, honestly. You are required to do 11 hour shifts."
good,"Worked here almost 5 years with work and going to school it was a pretty cool place to balance the two. If you're working part time don't depend on this job to be pay bills because there will be times that your hours get cut so bad that your checks may not even equal 200-300 dollars. Overall management depending on the store is okay. As a PT you get no benefits, you call out you miss out on money no sick time, they may put in sick time if management likes you pretty good. Overall favoritism is the way to get the top in this place. I will say if you want job experience work here."
good,too many Cliques. It wasnt good enough to do your job and go home. it felt like you had to brown nose to get ahead. it is good place to go if your are skilled at kissing butt; I just wasnt.
good,Back in 2015 Lowes was a great company. I enjoyed everybody that I work with and work for. Lowes is turning into a nightmare and a company that is going downhill fast. I thank Lowes for what it has taught me and I have enjoyed working their but due to the changes the company is making I fell that they are moving in the wrong direction.
good,Lowe's thrives on teamwork. The company provides great benefits and the ability to focus on family issues without problems. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with team members to solve problems.
good,"It was a great place to work, but management did not stand behined you like thay should have. I have worked in retail a lot and i understand costumer is always right. But there arw thoses exceptions. Something thay need to learn. I made that comp thousands in sales, but when the time came that i thougjt thay wpuld stand behind me thay didnt. So i quit."
good,Too many managers and not enough hands-on people. There were many instances where I would be the only person in the department and couldn't give the customers the attention they needed. I still enjoyed the job as I dealt with a wide variety of customers.
good,"Very busy most of the time so your day goes fast. The best thing about the business is the employees. Not the most positive atmosphere other than co-workers.  Very high expectations with minimal staff. They can't keep enough staff on to fully staff the store, so you are always playing catch up. Pay is not bad, although they just eliminated all the department managers to add more money to the bottom line. Benefits are continually being reduced or taken away completely."
good,"I loved the people I worked with. Easy to get along with. The management didn't seem to care much about anything but sales. Only got a bonus if you met sales goals and customer service goals, where management got the bonus if sales were met. Could've been a better work environment."
good,"A company absolutely obsessed with customer experience, to the extent that employees are expendable. Whatever the customer says is taken as gospel, with little to no backup for employees. "
good,"It was my first job. It's retail, a good place to get your feet wet and learn about all the wonders that retail has to offer. I grew up a lot in my 5 years working there. Definitely a lot of turn over, even in management."
good,Lowe's could only provide me with part time employment and as a father of 5 I needed a full time position. I enjoyed the position I held and enjoyed working with the public on deliveries
good,"Never go nights they won't let you leave other than and the pay for the amount of work is too low , the overnight worker should get a starting pay of $15.00 instead of $ 10.00"
good,"There is a good work culture in the stores, however the powers that be are introducing new programs that have all failed.  Komack designs failed, Sterling failed, Central delivery is failing, Central Install office is failing, and the new management restructure is failing already.  Its sad as its a good company that has no idea how to compete in the new retail environment.  A new upper management leadership team is the place to start."
good,As a seasonal assembler at Lowe's I would have minimal input from management.  The most they would tell me was to assemble specific products for display purposes or just to keep a stock of assembled products.  The job also had minimal direct interaction with customers.
good,"- shifts are generally 4 - 8 hours long"
good,"i do not wish to leave a review of this employer, the company is a big company and things and operational experiences are thing i wish not to expose. thank you"
good,"Great place to start. unfortunately it is very stressful and only getting more stressful."
good,The company as a whole is restructuring causing turmoil among the ranks so until it is finished I would hold off on looking for employment here for your own protection
good,I really enjoyed the individuals I got to work with on a daily basis. I had an excellent management team in my store. The corporate system can be frustrating at times.
good,"good professional work environment, i was responsible for working in paint department, home decor, and cashiering at times when needed.  I received training and help as needed"
good,Alright place to work. Not very professional or fair across the board. Upper management does not lead by example. Benefits and discounts a plus though.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, but retail does not pay enough to pay bills.  Enjoyed customer interaction.  Some management was great, others were not."
good,"The work is not to hard, they have great benefits but not so good pay for the work you do. You will be loading trucks or order filling you will have two 15 min breaks and a 30 min lunch"
good,"It's always busy so that's good, fast pace, and overall good vibe. Learned a lot about materials, ..sometimes employees need to be treated better as far as work life interfering with family time, manager attitude, treatment towards certain employees. Good insurance, vacation, pay is ok but think it can be better"
good,"High stress, high demand workplace with very limited resources.  Most managers are overwhelmed and hanging by a thread trying to manage disengaged employees and are critically understaffed in vital areas."
good,"A place to start and learn management /work ethics. If you are a customer service person, you will find this place easy to work. Enjoyable from this place for me is interaction with personal."
good,Not very employee oriented as they make it seem. Especially come overtime. Was nice until recent. Not much opportunity for bonus. Very hard work for long hours.
good,"Lowes is a good company to work for if you want to punch a clock, do your job and leave. The job is very boring and the days seem to last forever. Lowes does offer pretty good benefits which is a plus."
good,"Working at Lowe's rewarded me with wide varieties of knowledge about hardware stores, personal businesses, construction businesses, and information on the different types of resources used to run them as well. Being a customer service associate, it challenged me to have general knowledge on many different areas of the store. This job has a lot to learn from but there schedules are too demanding. They make attempts towards bettering the quality of their employee's family lives but the company will always come first. Full-Time employees don't get the time off they need. Two days off are split up in the course of a week and rarely do they get consecutive days off. All in all everyone there was great, they provided a nice work environment."
good,Working in the delivery dept. and meeting new people everyday taught me to be flexible and to be able to adapt to the situations that we would find our self's in on different job site.  The management was a part that I didn't spend a lot of time around because I was out doing delivers.  The hardest part of the job was never knowing when my day would end.
good,"Lowes used to offer free stock, their health coverage was better, and the discounts were excellent.  Now they just give discount when you buy stock, the health coverage is average, and you get an average discount %.  Staffing is too thin and being overworked and stressed is the new business model."
good,"If you are wanting to expand your knowledge of different products it's a good place to work. If you are wanting to advance your career, forget it!! "
good,"The job started out fast paced, but fun for the first six months that I worked at my store, but then management restructuring caused a large drop in morale as well as competence at the higher levels."
good,When a job requires the work of several different people the final outcome has variables beyond one individuals control .   the right people have to be in place from the top of the program down.. and the program is only as strong as its weakest coworker
good,"They expect you to run a whole department by yourself during training. None of the managers communicate with each other so you get in trouble for doing something another manager told you to do. Some managers will chat with you then walk away just to tell another manager to ""find something for you to do"". Other associates are NOT team players."
good,Good job was not very happy with the hours. You ask for certain things on your app and they give you what they want you to have without warning front end managers weren't always nice
good,I worked in the lawn and garden side of lowes. My job duty was to assist customers and provide them with great customer service. At the end of the day we had to close the section down and make sure everything was ready for the next day.
good,"With my previous experience in retail, Lowe's doesn't value or appreciate what I do. Though I am lacking in knowledge in some of the departments I give it my all to take care of our customers."
good,"A typical day at work was not easy, with most things involving you lifting or moving things. Management was very understanding and helped employees in what ways they could."
good,You are either extremely busy or extremely slow it was not consistent and it made the day go slow I did love who I worked with but this was not the line of work I wanted to be in it was temporary
good,"If you have more then one income then this is an OK job. The insurance rates are outrageous, Not really a place for a single mother. I have always worked hard and was able to care for my family. At Lowe's its impossible to care for my kids, on basic wages with no pay increase."
good,"If management was better, would bet better company to work for. If it wasn't so corrupt also wold be better company to work for. Managers always looking for small things to terminate employees."
good,"It can be a great company to work for as far as pay and benefits. It is now downsizing so the future of the company is uncertain. The management at this particular store is very poor. Many people have transferred or quit in the past year,"
good,"The organization had a great amount of growth in a short period of time, and it is in the process of defining what it needs to do for the next chapter of the its retail life."
good,Good working environment with a good culture. This job was ideal because it was a seasonal position in which I benefited from because I was a college student.
good,"Love working with people to help them design living spaces,  company has been great for the most part.  Just the typical retail changes every couple years.  "
good,As I had stated previously the job was enjoyable through the interactions of coworkers. However the management was poor. It did its purpose as a summer job.
good,"My summer job at Lowe's in Brownsburg, Indiana. It wouldn't have been as enjoyable if it weren't for my coworkers. Management at the store is sub-par. After continuing through my business courses in school I see more holes in the management process at the store. However it did well in suiting its purpose of a summer job."
good,"You need to have a storm back bone to help some of the customers how come in."
good,It's a great place to work at when you have a great manager standing behind you and taking notice of your hard work. The hardest part is when you are short with help and expected to exceed in your position with all of the duties that is required for the day.
good,"Lowe's is a company that, when i first started working there, cared about its customers and employees. Over the last 2 years I have watched as assisting customers took a backseat to turning and burning calls as quickly as possible, if its not a sale, its not worth your time. I watched good employees who had been there for years, get replaced by newer agents who could be paid less. The culture has changed, the supervisors are now forced to stand over the shoulders of employees to ensure that they are working, micro management has taken over."
good,"My disability got to the point I was no longer to do the Job. Start at 6:30am work until completed. Learned how to operate a Moffett forklift. learned about appliances. HR and upper management was good. Lower management did not understand CDL driver regulations. For the most part it was ""that's not my job"" mentality. Hardest part of job was getting help from anyone outside of your department. Most enjoyable part of job was working with and helping customer's."
good,"While working for Lowe's for the last year, I have seen multiple variations of management and employee sustainability. The main focus is on customer service."
good,"Good place to work if management likes you.  Fun environment, and good employee recognition.  Good computer training modules to help further information related to the job spectrum"
good,"Fast Paced. "
good,The work environment is pretty good with work life balance and solid benefits. The company preaches servant leadership but the Sr. Executives have lost touch and use consultants and HR analysts to make decisions instead of consulting their own employees.
good,The atmosphere is quiet. Very friendly people. I enjoyed working with people who loved assisting customers and also new associates who were not familiar with the store.
good,"great starting pay..raises are none or nominal. upward mobility slim, inconsistent hours, bonuses have become harder and harder to get, to the point of rare. Just got told most of us are losing our jobs ( Department managers). Paid breaks are if you have time to take them. Mandatory hour lunch breaks if work over 6 hours(unpaid) lunch break is too long, makes it a 9+ hour day and take them when and if there is coverage"
good,"Lowes is hard work, start to finish. Most people there were good to work with and for. "
good,"Is it a place i would consider a life long career? No, Its a great place for a first time job or a job during school. Great people to work with but management is far from quality."
good,Lowe's was a good job even though I was a seasonal employe there the day went pretty fast and I got along with everything there is would work there again
good,"layoff corporation cuts "
good,"Lowe's is a decent place to learn and grow. I've had the opportunity to gain vast knowledge about all types items, departments, and the uses and function of both. Management is fair, reasonable and understanding. The hardest part of my job is the customers. I never expected all of the different types of personalities, perspectives and emotions from people. I do enjoy the company, teamwork and unity of some of my coworkers. We all help each other to have a safe, fun and productive workplace."
good,"For the most part, Lowe's is a decent place to work. You start off at decent pay. They work with school schedules, which is very helpful. The management isn't the greatest, but it works. The employees are pretty decent towards one another."
good,"The company is currently undergoing a purge at the management level, and hiring is limited to entry only.  Any hiring for upper levels usually is from current employees.  Expect to function in an understaffed area, with no coverage for lunches."
good,"Go in at 9:00 work till 2:00. "
good,No Comment. I do not have any comment to post on Lowe's Home improvement Stores. Employees worked hard with minimal support from senior management.
good,"Very unorganized, and hectic no real guidance. I don't now if this happened after the flood but its chaotic. I really don't know how to describe it."
good,good place to work if you enjoy doing the same thing every day. Very unwilling to work with you over illness. good benefits rather expensive
good,Quite monotonous and had continuous policy changes from corporate. Management was in disarray at times and definitely played favorites at times.
good,"Each day involves looking for product listed on a scanned report while helping customers and probably covering another department or two. As a manager, you have to shift associates to where the business is taking them away from their assigned duties for which they will suffer. I learned patience and how to communicate more effectively with a broader range of people; both associates and customers. Management was hit and miss, some good some not, all overworked. The culture varied from store to store and within each store. Morale filtered from the management. The hardest part of the job was getting assigned tasks done in a timely manner while handling associate and customer concerns. The most enjoyable was helping an appreciative customer."
good,"Lowe's is in that transition from growth brand to a position of returning shareholder value first from a mature market challenger.  That means the slow departure of founders and culture backfilled with Lean Six Sigma and the challenge to do ""more with less"".  They say the right things, but have outgrown the capacity to empower people and recognize merit across their silos."
good,Recent changes leads one to believe that all Lowes cares about is stockholder profits.  They do this on the backs of long time employees.  They seem to be gravitating to an all part time work force.
good,"Management Jobs are great for pay and benefits but absolutely the Worst for job security. they announced they were cutting 1% of their ""management"" workforce when it actuality it was 8 %, and they do not tell you that your job was discontinued you find out by UPS when a letter comes in the mail a week before termination. They kept their favorites and termed the ones who didn't kiss their a...."
good,Lowe's actually is a rather fulfilling and satisfying company to work for however it depends on which store. The job is never difficult and is enjoyable from time to time but the out-of-touch/never available management makes the job very frustrating on many levels.
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowes. Good company culture,some opportunity for advancement. Decent training and bonus potential."
good,Poor hours for part time employees. If you enjoy being left out in a department other than your own and not trained for Lowe's is your place.
good,When I started lowe's was a great place to work at and just went downhill over time. Their new company model has eradicated the means of moving up in the company. It gave false hope to the employees trying to move up. They are now just looking for part timers to fill in all the salary and full time jobs they cut.
good,"I felt this company was unfair when it came to worker/ customer issues. They would never listen to the side of the staff member. Where very quick to punish instead of hearing everything. "
good,Short-handed on worker everyone that works there does not know how to do their job in the proper way need more available train. The Lowe's store that I work for is short-handed on people that work in shipping and receiving and short-handed as well on night stockers
good,Worked here for almost 10 and there is to much change at the top of the chain make store life unstable and not a get home life.
good,Never enough staffing. Never thought Lowes would get rid of my job after  years of service. Loss of a lot of experience can't help a company. Too heavy at the upper mgr level.
good,The way the matrix is made up it feels like you are there 24/7. Mainly when you get the weekend off you have to work 6 days straight after.
good,"Each day is surely different and a fast paced environment is fun.  The customers seem to make the day better."
good,A fair work place store level management are good to work for. Enjoyed co workers team building willing to help each area in order to acomplish goals as a team
good,"The Florence, Ky Lowe's flooring department makes for a fast-paced, hectic day, every day.  This past year the department amassed nearly 3.5 million dollars is sales."
good,"The work is easy, the management for the most part does not micro- manage. Co- workers are decent. The job isn't difficult, they often bring food for the entire staff."
good,Pays well and chances for advancement. You get to meet all kinds of people from different cultures. Health insurance is high.
good,It takes a strong person to work with people fives days a week. Hardest part of the job is going past work hours when there is a truck at the end of the night
good,It was a ok place was hired to be a unload trucks but was promoted to paint desk to wait on the customers. Was to much time in between the customers so found myself unloading trucks anyway
good,"Very fast paced store during Lowe's peak from March through July. Virtually impossible to actually take your breaks if you are in building materials as you may leave only one other CSA to cover 4, 50 yard aisles and loading the front of Building Materials with perhaps up to a hundred people in your area. Be extremely careful with your head on a swivel."
good,Worked well with others. Attentive to detail. Always accomplished my duties on time. I learned a lot from other employees. The most enjoyable part was working with some employees.
good,"It is not a bad company to work for, it's just about who are your superiors. If the managers are bad, it will be a bad place to work. That is it."
good,"work with good people always willing to help, lots of training, management always there to listen and help. wish my job would be offered full time. lots to learn always something new. hardest part is irate customers."
good,"good place to work but bad management."
good,": Managed all checkout functions by processing sales transactions and refunds. Monitored cash drawer transactions maintained at the checkout area. Provided coverage at cash registers, as needed. Directly supervised 10-15 employees and Provided one-on-one training for cashiers. Conducted an inventory control system to minimize merchandise shrinkage. Monitoring/Assessing performance of individuals, or organizations to make improvements or take corrective action. Maintained records of special item orders."
good,Overworked and underpayed. Stores are usually understaffed but the people that work there and management always do what they can to help
good,"In my case, management did a poor job assembling staff in new location.  I was not given schedule flexibility due to favored needs of other department employee who could not work past 5 pm.  I was promised a better schedule balance, but mgmt. never followed thru, leaving me stuck with more than 75% scheduled closing shifts.  Not good for married life!"
good,"It is a genuine pleasure to work with the public, and Help people realize their hopes and dreams. To know you were apart of that is truly upfliting"
good,"With the store I work at being a training store for new store managers the store, I feel is only productive depending on the new store manager that is in the position at the time.  We have had some good store managers and at the moment a bad one.  A typical day at work is busy due to having to keep up with my job and any paperwork assigned to me by my immediate manager.  I have learned a lot working here but the main thing I learned is how to help everyone that walks through that door to come shop to leave with a smile since the front end is their last point of impact with the store.  My co-workers are great for the most part.  There is always a few bad apples in every bunch but it seems that they are the ones that are always getting rewarded for something that someone else did.  The hardest part of the job is not telling the store manager how to do his job correctly to ensure that the store has enough coverage in order to run effectively throughout the day.  The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting all the people that I do everyday and having so many customers that know me and request me when they come in if they need help with something."
good,A great work environment fun go happy employees it's fun helping customers with their home improvement jobs management are good and easy to get along with
good,"While the managers at the department range were fantastic, the assistant store managers were not taking there job seriously and were not taking initiative in their work leading the rest of the store in a negative environment."
good,The mangers sometimes don't no what's going on. The cop. Office doesn't care about there employees only there money. If you get vacation time you have to use it by the end of the year even if you get it in like October.
good,"The place is good to work for sales, and most of the sales team is friendly. The workers that receive the product are really hard workers as well."
good,"Management did not seem to respect low level employees. Often required to do tasks beyond my pay grade with little to no appreciation or acknowledgement. Schedules were repeatedly miss managed, along with breaks and lunches"
good,Not bad place for someone with no family. Hours are not family oriented.m management does what they can with the folks that work there. Alot of he said she said.
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for, you have to maintain a certain attitude and look to be recognized by future advancement. Lowe's has great benefits and is full of great employees to work for and with. Lowe's has potential to progress but only is chosen. Alot of work is expected with minimal pay."
good,Great company to work for unless you want to move up into anything above an assistant manager. Hours are long and if you break it down hourly you are not getting paid what you deserve.
good,"The compensation is ok. You get no help tho, your on ur own. Cashiers are basically left alone to fend for themselves. Head cashiers are mean, & they dont do anything."
good,"good foro people without families, culture is okay, but there are definatly better places to work..........................................................."
good,"It's a job, that paid my bills, I couldn't complain much about it, the place was ok to work at, customers were always nice so there was nothing wrong there"
good,The staff was great.  Management still had a lot to learn about expectations put upon staff in regards to opening a new store and planning for item location in advance of nightly reception.
good,"Decent place to work. They should rethink the scheduling.  Some people want to open , some like mids and some like to closes. They should survey the employees in what they think of the schedule. They should crack down on the people that don't live up to he standards of their company sets."
good,"Coming from Home Depot, working at Lowe's was quite different.  Task Oriented.  Not as much emphasis on Customer Service.  I much rather preferred working for Home Depot."
good,"Those looking to start off in a robust corporate workplace, Lowe's is a good step to begin a climb up the corporate ladder."
good,I enjoyed my time at Lowes I learned many different skill sets that are able to help me within my current job search. Coworkers as well as management were helpful when I had issues. A typical day could be stressful within the fast paced call center but overall I feel that the environment helped me because the customer service specialist I am today. Thank you!
good,"Job began really well. One manager had a bad attitude towards everyone and began causing trouble with me and my position. She cut my hours back from 40 hours per week to 9. She is the main reason for my seeking employment elsewhere. She treated me really unprofessionally and when I went to HR to try to improve or rectify the situation, they told me I was just being sensitive."
good,"May not be a good company anymore, because a lot changed when I quit. Management was never willing to help you or other departments. Did receive a pay increase every year. Had all benefits and vacation days. Not easily willing to work with your schedule for doctor apts, etc."
good,"Clean, stocked, trained and helped customer's and or co-workers. There was nothing hard about the job,m it was pretty self explanatory. When I did not know an answer for a customer I did everything possible to assist him or her by doing research to better suit their needs."
good,"Lowe's really takes the time and utilizes their red vest red program to train their new staff and it was definitely helpful having training before even stepping out onto the sales floor. My co-workers were all very helpful and continued to be supportive of me as I became part of their family. My only complaint is that there was definitely a lack of communication between mangers and associates. Overall, I've enjoyed my time at Lowe's and I've had a decent introduction to retail."
good,It was a great experience even though I was there as a seasonal hire. I found it easy to get along with everyone there and the management was fair. I feel as if maybe there was a bunch of miscommunication but those of us who were on the floor managed with team work. I enjoyed the customers the most.
good,"Once I got used to things, It was a nice place to work.  nice coworkers.  I didn't get much training, had to do it on own.  I learned about taking care of flowers/plants.  The management was very easy to work with and the atmosphere was laid back."
good,"I was in 4 departments at lowes in my time working there, a lot of people not staying in there departments, and doing their jobs. Having more and more responsibility, put on you all the time to do more than possibile. very un organized, and nobody caring about what they do"
good,"Loved working with the plants. Only got one weekend off a month, an d working night did not work will for my family. Management was lacking at the time, but I hear it was gotten better."
good,"Clock in after getting vest resdy. Police department, help customers, stock shelves, stage orders. Check on orders, complete tasks, downstock merchandise, zone recover."
good,"Hard to move up within the store. Store manager micro manages every single move that you do. Hard to talk to, Associates are the best. However some take the job to serious and act like managers when they are not."
good,"it is a nice place to work if you have a full time job there, but that is hard to obtain. it can be stressful and it's a good place for a second part time job."
good,"Lowes was a fun place to work. Learned about all the different industrial items. Helped customers in Lumber, made sure all customers were dealt with in a timely manner. Front-faced items. Lunch and breaks were always taken on time."
good,Very hectic with low support. Schedules are erratic and subject to multiple changes. This varies from store to store levels.
good,My previous job at Lowe's was definitely a job that would give me the opportunity to put my skills to work.i worked in a very fast paced environment and was kept on my toes by continuously multi tasking and sometimes doing more than just my job on any given day. The position often called for quick decision making and deciphering complicated situations. The management that I worked for understood that I could be an employee that did not need a lot of assistance or help and that I could carry a stressful load of work and kick it out of the park. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction of helping customers if they had an issue with a project or problem and needed assistance in making it correct. The hardest part of my job was when we would be short handed and I had to get more than just mu job done in a small amount of time.
good,A typical day starts by switching cash balances with previous shift manager and then monitoring the employees and store throughout shift. You maintain the shelves and delegate jobs to employees. When end of shift comes you balance the safe and turn over to next shift manager or close the store.
good,"hardest part of the job is working with outdated systems to operate appliance sales. "
good,"-No breaks"
good,"I find that while it isn't a particularly hard job to perform, and it is as rudimentary as things get with running a cash register and performing stocking duties, it's apparent the management culture and overabundance of rules can be stifling. While I find that it has been a steady place of employment, the lack of opportunities to go any further or get raises easily hampers long term employment, at least part time employment."
good,bueno la empresa es algo bueno no digo que buena al 100 porque para mi no lo es en algunas cosas no es justa o buena y en algunas si lo son el trato que se le da a los empleados es bueno pero cuando se habla en lo laboral solo se centran en los que aportan mas que los que hacen bien su trabajo y se centran en ello y los otros no lo terminan pero la empresa ve ganancia y solo los ayudan o les dan mas beneficios a ellos siempre en muchas empresas habrá algo que no nos guste y algo que si.
good,"Working for Lowes for the amount of time I have learned a few things. They don't do a lot of overtime which is nice because you get your work done and you go home. Upper management has a new direction wherein they try to be leaders and not tyrants. As you move up, compensation gets a lot better, However, leadership can still be defined by popularity. Should Lowes like you in the position you are in and given no better option maybe they will promote you, promotions are based on their need and not what you as an employee want to do. You'd have to leave your home store if you want to change jobs unless they think you'd fit the part perfectly. Training is lackluster at best, sitting at a computer doing modules doesn't teach you much and then hopefully you have a manager who half way knows their department let alone has any extra time to teach you how to do your job. Lowes really could be an outstanding company if they stopped running skeleton crews and expecting thier employees to be able to carry the weight of the store while stock holders and CEO's get richer every year. its a good place to start your work life if youre getting out of high school or a hold over job if youre transitioning between jobs or college, but as far as careers go, unless you love the stress of retail, look else where, its unbalanced and unfair in terms of pay vs expectation."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job for me was to impact our internal customers in furthering their own career by one on one's, coaching, and feedback. This in turn helped our external customers love their experience organically."
good,"The workload in this fast paced environment can be trying at times. With minimal breaks, a large workload and little management support left the morale of the workers at a loss. Most of the co-workers were friendly and supportive of one another. A lack of training seemed to be apparent in all areas though. Dealing with the public's needs was the most enjoyable part of the position. However, many of Lowes' procedures were not logical thus hindering employees' ability to make logical decisions."
good,Shift changed all the time. Short shifts of 4-6 hours each. Basically on call all the time to fill in for other people that didn't show up for work. Best part of job was dealing with customers. Learnt  to process customers payments to their accounts and how to process their charge accounts.
good,"I can honestly say the typical day at work was awesome for me and I took enjoyment in making my department look amazing for the customers. What I learned from the experience working at Lowe's was the best thing to do, is to stay to yourself and get the job done in a speedy timely manner and keep yourself out of the drama. As far as management goes, I don't think they kept up with their duties as leaders, often found them just walking around joking around with each other and tend to not take care of the issues that have been brought up to them. As far as the co-workers go, most of them were just fine and got along great with everybody, but like any other retail store, there is always going to be the employees who try to get away with doing the minimum amount for the day. Which also leads that to being the the hardest part of the job, it's hard to do your work while watching someone who's supposed to be helping you, not do everything that needs to be done."
good,great job for a college student unless you plan to work here for your whole life be prepared to work weekends and some holidays. management is awesome would work here again.
good,"On a daily basis, I would be a cashier and handle purchases and money, and ensure customer satisfaction to the best of my ability. I learned how to deal with customer complaints face to face and provide a reasonable solution to their issues, if possible. Most of the managers are understanding, and my co-workers made the job enjoyable."
good,Lowes is a great company. The management could use some improvement though. It seems like there's a lot of politics within the company and the people that do well typically do not get noticed for it as a result.
good,I have learned a lot. Being a cashier and working as a leader of cashiers. The hours are difficult at times. The people are very knowledgable in their fields.
good,"Working at Lowes was pretty good, its just that working overnight while being a student just wasn't for me. The pay for the work that was expected as an employee wasn't enough, however it was great for learning how different types of systems, machinery and equipment work."
good,working at Lowe's isn't hard at all.  As long as you know what your job is far as keeping your shelves stock and be willing to help customers at anytime.
good,Laid back and pay was a good offer for seasonal help. The staff here is good. It is challenging and I feel a sense of accomplishment when I leave at the end of my shift.
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits and compensation.  Retail schedule doesn't allow a good work/life balance.  Lowe's has good retention for retail."
good,I like working there. Nice people I work with. They are always short handed. I cant operate the forklift without another person.Bad management
good,"Not a bad place to work, can be a little unorganized at times but nothing too bad. If you're looking for a job where you can meet different types of people this is a good place to be."
good,"Your typical Corporation.  Good pay, No team or family type environment vibe.  Management is mostly done through the mainland, where ONLY numbers matter.  Many times people get spread too thin."
good,"Lowe's is a pretty big store and each department varies in business. Personally, I worked in building materials, which where i live is the most busy department of them all for the most part. I like Lowe's overall but the managing could be a bit better. We rarely have enough people for the volume of customers, which results in us employees being overworked tremendously."
good,"It's always a work in progress.  Challenges within the company as"
good,you can learn a lot but  they do not pay as well as you want for the type of work that you will be doing. Great people there. A friendly customers
good,"what I liked most was interacting with the customers, also enjoyed helping them find what they need. Co-workers were awesome and friendly always helped me with any problems I had."
good,"Lowes was my first time working in a retail environment. Once the adjustment had taken place I quickly adapted. Learned where product was located. and was able to fully assist customers, even with special orders. The management is extraordinary, especially now that we received a new store manager. Great team now. My co workers for the most part were very helpful in my training and constant learning curves. The hardest part of the job was learning to engage people on the spot, attempt to assist, and prevent loss of product. That also, when I knew that I had a satisfied customer was the best part of the job."
good,"Lowes will pay you a decent wage and more often or not, if you show up on time you do well. However, getting promoted from within is often an issue and most times outside hires are made to avoid moving people up from within. This creates a glass ceiling."
good,"I work with some really great people. I like that I am recognized for all my hard work and dedication to the company. Lowe's is a very easy, relaxed environment. The management is very well trained and easy to get along with. There are some miscommunication among management, but problems usually gets solve quickly and orderly."
good,receiving truck of merchandise and material scanning in all. verify quantity on each shipment. Manage crew of 8 for stocking merchandise in the store in a safe and timely manner with power equipment. schedule times for truck companies. Manage time for hourly employees not to exceed 40 hours.
good,not enough hours and hard company for work for. they do not care enough about their employees. all they care about is money
good,Lowes is a good overall learning experience. Quick way to learn the ins and outs of business and product management. Like with most jobs management within the store can be hit or miss. Co-workers are good always willing to help and create a friendly environment. Hardest part is completing tasks with the job being understaffed.
good,Don't pay much. Don't get very many hours if not full time. Hard to advance up. People was nice to work with. Got tested for cashiering each month.
good,The people I worked with made the job bearable.  The management made the job more difficult then necessary.  I started the day pulling deliveries for the current day and then started calling people. The hardest part was coming in and nothing was pulled for the current day of deliveries
good,a good place for a first job or someone who enjoys working in the retail environment. As far as full time employment it seems few and far between opportunities.
good,"Being a Manager in Lowe’s requires excellent management and leadership skills since I was responsible for the overall performance of my assigned departments. I was tasked to oversee the sales of the departments and make sure that sales objectives are met or exceeded and I was also responsible for making strategy plans to maximize sales. As a Manager I also ensure that my staff was performing their jobs according to the company’s operational policies and procedures, and I modeled world-class customer service to Lowe’s customers."
good,"Lowe's is a very customer focused place to work. Lowe's was a good place to start a career with many opportunities to move up and cross-train to different departments. The company had to start making changes due to the prices in the current market. This caused a huge reduction in hours. Part time employees were only allowed 15 hours a week, and seasonal employees only worked on the weekends. Even with the major cut in hours Lowe's was not willing to work with a set schedule to allow second jobs. Lowe's also made it impossible to move to Full-Time. Even if you received a promotion to a Full-Time position, Lowe's fixed the position to Part-time. It became evident that Lowe's and the management staff at this time were more concerned with themselves than their employees. We turned into I within minutes."
good,"I liked working there for a large portion of the job, it was stressful but rewarding kind of. I however had a problem of the macro-managing from your plethora of managers to report to. You would get different orders from different managers, very often conflicting with each other. They demanded too many things (such as look after another department even though youre drowning in work from your own department). When the store first started (I helped build the store), its manager was meh, but the next manager was amazing. He would go around to the departments and ask if they needed help, and he had a hand in everything but didnt feel like he was breathing down your neck. He was an awesome manager, keyword was. I assume he had a lot of pressure from the higher ups because he changed drastically to a delegate type of manager without really listening to the employees on their feedback. "
good,"Not enough opportunities for women in technology at higher positions. great people to work with, but a lot of politics. "
good,Good corporate company. Each location manager differs. Finding a location with good management and department placement are critical
good,"Responsible for coordinating and scheduling installations by reviewing and managing Installed Sales paperwork and contacting installers and customers throughout the process, ensuring merchandise is ready for installer pickup or delivery by pulling and staging items beforehand, and confirming customer satisfaction. Also responsible for communicating and building relationships with installers, customers, and vendors and for assisting with the training and coaching of employees on the Installed Sales program and order management system."
good,"Nice play to work, Co-workers were very nice to work with. The management was very close minded, liked things done one way and one way only. Daily routine goes by fast, long chore list along with customer help!"
good,Not enough staff to handle the volume of loading landscape materials. And very poor attention paid to scheduling needs.
good,"its a decent job, especially for a college student."
good,"I enjoy working at Lowe's, Riverton, UT. Not all Lowe's are created equally, though. Atmosphere is friendly and team oriented. A large percentage of the customers are friendly as they undertake projects to make their homes into better places. Periodic employee celebrations (with food) occur about every other month. Morale is pretty good. The pay could be better and advancement can be difficult without certain prior product and sales knowledge."
good,"Retail seems to attract those who are not really committed to doing their best.  Associates, as well as management, are constantly changing; changing the store climate on a regular basis.  Job duties, hours and supervisors are changed regularly and without notice.  I worked on various reports for most of my tenure with Lowe's, which provided the diversity in my day that I enjoy.  The positive to retail is that it will teach you to be flexible and to have patience with others, be it customers, associates or management."
good,opportunity to meet wonderful people. good benefits. takes away from your social life. i do not advise working here if you are family oriented. great place to work if your trying to move up a corporate ladder.
good,Good place to work as a high school student. Has many different departments to be able to learn and grow depending on the individual. Flexible hours for part timers.
good,at lowes i would overlook all the outside inventory and load all customers using the forklift.Keeping the outside of the store clean and making sure every cusomer was helped with loading heavy items.
good,it was great working with lowes . i got lot of customer service experience and got good experience for administrative skills too.
good,"loved my job and most of the people I worked with. If you are doing your job I don't think you should have to walk on ur tip toes when management is around. it might not be the way they do it but if it is getting done in a safe and accurate way don't bother us. don't like because if you didn't kiss butt they wouldn't give you the time of day. besides the management everything about Lowes I loved."
good,"This is a big box retail store. I like my co-workers and customers a good deal. I do however have a job that is very physically demanding as I often have to lift and load bags of 40-50lbs as well as wall retaining blocks for 8 hours or longer. I am also on my feet for the entire shift on concrete. This is the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is some of the things that I have learned while there, relationships with co-workers and customers, and the benefits that come with working there."
good,"Great co-workers, not so great management. Overall, an okay place to work. Management didn't really care about their employees."
good,"Lots of physical labor and customer service, extensive use of power machinery including various forklifts and saws, project management"
good,"There is no typical day, every day is challenging, people don't come to work every day with the same attitude. You have to pump them up and get them ready to help the customer. Have to sort out the good times, slow times, and the great times."
good,A decent rotating schedule that allows for some weekends off. Hours are all over the place. Generally understaffed due to budget restrictions. Good advancement potential for motivated individuals.
good,"Lowe's was a very constant work place my day to day usually consist of overwhelming upset customers due to failure of managerial duties to notify customer and employ leaving me with a poor amount of rapport to build off of and ,satisfy customer base other than basic customer service, I would prepare orders for deliveries using the necessary power equipment order picker forklift etc. however my fellow co-workers were very optimistic and inviting."
good,"Fun place to work as fellow employees are friendly, management only cares about sales and not about personal growth. Red tape and politics out the wazoo."
good,"Decent pay with opportunities for advancement. There are a select few in management that needs improvement.  Overall it is just as most places, some pros, some cons."
good,"The company urges teamwork, but it is not shared throughout, which makes the entry level position entirely way more stressful than it should be.  Does not have enough employees, ever."
good,"el ambiente de trabajo es bueno en piso de venta, dentro de mis aprendizajes puedo destacar el interactuar con muchas personas y el trato con gente muy diversa eso es enriquecedor porque te amplia el panorama en cuanto al trato de personal."
good,"I did have a good experience as a cashier, but when I moved to customer service it was chaos. if a manager was having a bad day you were there to catch the heat. you were not safe there. but overall it is a good place to work but I would never be at the service desk again."
good,Manage employees and task while providing quality control to the indoor lawn and Garden Center. Manage stocking and product placement.
good,"In the store I work in, the crew of people are a family. Things go off without a hitch and we work very well together. The management team has been overhauled in the past 3 months and is coming along, but they have a way to go in order to be a true part of our family/team."
good,"Fast paced organization assisting customers with various needs."
good,"Overall it has the potential to be a good working experience. It is very hard work physically and mentally. Its generally agreed by all employees above and below that the department manager position is the worst position in the store.  The pay is not equivalent to the work load and responsibility. Once you become an assistant store manager, the pay becomes much better and the physical aspect of the job lessens."
good,"Being this was the last position I held with the company, it was by far the most challenging. This requirement of stocking the entire store from the distribution center had many hurdles to over come. I feel the store did the best they could under the circumstances. "
good,"It seems like the harder you work, the more responsibilities you end up with. Management doesn't like to train new people, so the same hard workers end up worker harder than people that don't seem to care."
good,Working at this job has its pros and cons. I have learned that putting the customer first is key when working in retail. This is a alright place to work.
good,"A great environment for growth and achievement. They appreciate their employees, part-time benefits could use some improvement but all around not a bad place to work"
good,Management sucks and they have an issue rehiring for some reason. In just a matter of 3 years at least 3/4 of the people that worked there in permanent positions that I knew have left and most due to how lousy it's ran.
good,"Love being aroud people and interacting with customers.  Over time they become your second family.  The down side was working outside in the elements during the winter months with no kind of heat provided.  I am a very freindly and outgoing person and that store in perticular the people that worked there were not all that friendly.  You would go to the break room for lunch and others would be there but, no one spoke to each other.  I found that a little strange."
good,"management sucks, really hard to advance, great co workers, easy work, great competitive pay, great part time benefits"
good,I enjoyed working with the different types of customers that would shop in the store.  It created an interesting work environment.
good,"Coworkers slack off and don't get in trouble"
good,"excellent pay, poor management. I worked for this company for a year and was very unhappy while there. granted, working for customer care does have its good and bad days."
good,"Typical day at Lowes' working the service desk and it's very busy moving from one register to the other, it's cool and fun when you can sign into more than one register at a time. One register I can do a return, another I can process a credit card payment, another I can check out a customer. I love the busy season I learned a lot at Lowe's I really enjoyed working there, I love serving other's it gives me fullfilment. The management was great and they were dedicated and they love their job at Lowe's. The hardest part was dealing with the slow days when you wait to get your first customer to serve. The most enjoyable part is you get to meet lots of new people they come from miles to shop at Lowe's."
good,Lowe's has a good foundation with it's customer service ideal Lowe's does offer great wages and benefits. They offer a corporate schedule that allows the associates to know what their days off are going to be month to month.  Training for managers is minimum to none.
good,The company itself has some really good ideas and has some clear goals at the top as to where they are heading... sad thing is that message gets lost on its way done to the people dealing with the customers. It takes being in the good old boys club to make it anywhere higher than low level management.
good,"I was an ASM so my days were always busy. I worked around a lot of good people and met a lot of good people also.  I was responsible for many daily activities, but took them all in stride."
good,Standing on my feet all day was a challenge. I liked meeting new people. I was cashier. Program not hard to use. Training was often but easy.
good,"customer service. learned to drive forklifts and pickers. unload truck and stock products. learned to mix paint, and make copies of keys. the hardest part of the job was lifting bags of motar for customers. best part of job was meeting new people and helping with their needs."
good,"Great entry level opportunity with decent starting pay.  You will learn cash handling skills, customer service, and cash register operations fairly quickly.  Training program is great.  This position will make you learn how to develop customer service which most important in any retail business."
good,the team is very kind but as stated some members of management are uncooperative and distance in communication but overall a good place to work as long as you get a very clear understanding of your assignment
good,Every day was different based off of what shift you worked. You got to work with a lot of different people and you never knew what excitement would come that day. I think the hardest part was not feeling like you have the support you needed from management or the younger people who were hired and you never knew if they were going to show up for their shift and trying to run the front end short staffed when you have to have a certain number of people and coverage needed. The most enjoyable part I walked away from this job was the friendships I had made and my customer service skills I grew.
good,Non stop action from open to close in a Retail environment.Structured organization within a home environment setting.
good,"When I started here it was a great company to work for and advancement opportunities were everywhere. About 4 years ago they signed a government contract that required veteran employees to apply and interview for job openings within the store.  Meaning they were in contention with outside employees with no work experience at Lowe's, and job went tot he better interviewer. Seniority is meaningless."
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers as well as loading and unloading lumber and concrete."
good,"There are problems with management at the Store level. There are managers who do not have the experience, temperament, communication or leadership skills to supervise and motivate people.  There are also too many layers of management."
good,in order to get advance you must be on the floor not a cashier. once you are there it is almost impossible to move and are not treated well by staff. they change procedure daily depending on the asm on duty.rules are different per employee as well.
good,"Not the best pay but most of the customers especially the elder ones made the day worth goin to work. This is where i learned how to  drive a reach truck, also forklifts."
good,it didnt feel like a career job or anything with people who were known to have bad work habits being promoted... but all in all it was a fair place to work despite that.
good,I enjoyed the training aspect. The most difficult part of the job was always being on my feet. I had great co-workers and decent managers.
good,Difficult a very non professional working environment. Co-workers more as so competed with each other and tried to get the other fired.
good,Not accommodating for personal and family issues. Very little opportunity to advance for most people and they have a 'hard cap' for hourly wages.
good,"Started out part time in tools then moved to full time in electrical, then plumbing and installed sales. The work was a good fit for what I needed at the time."
good,"I proved at this job that a female can do a good job here, but it was not easy. Refrigerators and washers are REALLY Heavy and it was extremely hard work. Some Customers' homes were not clean or they had animals which would make the job even more uncomfortable. But Lowes is a really strong and good company. This particular position was just not for me."
good,"A typical day for all sales specialists includes meeting sales quotas, assisting walk-in customers in all departments as well as answering customer requests by phone; fulfilling internet orders; stocking shelves; unloading and top-stocking freight; housekeeping duties such as sweeping, dusting; loading purchases in customers' vehicles; fulfilling internet and special orders; processing installed sales services; and cashiering."
good,I have learned to deal with tough situations and how to defuse them as well.... I have been able to  maintain a great work relationships with co-workers as well as management.
good,I worked with customer orders and complaints.  I supervised cashiers and helped process large orders for other departments.  I was in charge of approving returns.
good,"The thing I've experienced at the big box stores is that"
good,Good place to work part time. Work hours vary from week to week between early morning start and late evening start. Never a 40 hour week. On feet all day. Not much opportunity for advancement.
good,"Typical day starts early and ends late.  Customer service is main priority.  Delivery driver stays away from home life quite a bit.  Home nightly, very strenuous work."
good,Is fun meeting all the customers.  Helping people.  I learned alot about different building materals in the on-line classes.  Management was unable to make set scheduals so you can have a life can only plan 10 days in advanced because you never new when you were going to work.  Go to work 3pm to 11pm and back the next day at 6 am.  Hard to have a life.
good,"Fun place to work will promote from within, high turnover depending on location of store. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management, but this varied from manager to manager. On busy day time could go by very fast."
good,Management acts like everyone below them are children. Hours were ok. People were treated to different standards and not held to the same accountability.
good,"it was an experience, unloading and loading pallets. good people to work with, the hours were decent and pay could have been more"
good,"Management young and still making rookie mistakes, company goals and processes good. Poor management has blocked advancement oppourtunities"
good,"Typical work day consists with walking the floor, helping customers and running the floor whenever the manager is absent. Occasionally the manager will have unfinished work which you will have to finish for him or her. Other times the floor will be cluttered and disorganized, which you have to fix as soon a possible while still paying attention to customers. Benefits are good for full-time employees."
good,offered a good insurance package. opportunity for advancements and transfers and training. Very busy place. You were never bored.
good,Lowe's has offered me room to grow during my time employed there. The only thing I wish there was more more teamwork and a more supportive management team.
good,Lowe's is a good job to have while in college. Hours and compensation could be improved but they are not any different than any other job in the retail industry. Benefits are slightly above average but somewhat expensive for an entire family. They do offer an employee discount and paid time off.
good,"Can provide paths of advancement, but with each level comes less job security.  Individual departments can be very well ran and a pleasure to work for, while others have bad cultures and negative behaviors."
good,"Lowe's offers a competitive salary and benefits package.  If you enjoy retail, you will enjoy working here.  Can be a lot of fun, but its hard work."
good,Started my day with order management and calling customers.I got to learn everything about home improvement and customer service.Management was a little to set on micromanagement and my co-workers were a bunch of fun.The hardest part of the job was having managers that did not know how to do their jobs.The best was meeting new people every day.
good,It really depends what department and what management you are subject to as to how good the job will be. At the low end it is competitive in terms of salary with other retailers.
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowe's, however when I got pregnant they did not treat me fairly. When my doctor put me on moderate restrictions the HR manager told me to leave immediately."
good,I had fun working there for approx 6 months but then management increased everyone's sales expectations which were unobtainabale
good,"Good job.  Not much pay.  New store we set up.  Morale was very poor and every territory manager who loved the company wound up quitting.  Overwork many of their managers and eventually wear them out with many hours, rotating shifts, early mornings, etc.  Burnout typical."
good,"fast learned, easy going,love the customers, sweet employees"
good,"Overall not a bad job, just not much of a career job. If your young or retired its ok."
good,"Your first month as a cashier will be pretty awesome. The other cashiers are nice and helpful when you have questions. The system is honestly the best I have ever dealt with. BUT after that first month generally everyone will expect you to know everything even if you only have 3 days of training (working on the same till as someone watching them do transactions) after that ""training"" you are pretty much on your own and its pathetic. The majority of the other employees will start to get mad at you if you don't know how to do things, which will be likely because the training is horrible here."
good,It is almost impossible to advance with this company it's all about the buddy system. Hours are cut for part time associates to the point the full time associates are run ragged by the time the hours go back up; Understanding that is business it just makes your job harder. Your coworkers become your family and over all the customers are pretty great. They still offer some great rewards for the store meeting its numbers although that is hard to achieve.
good,My mornings would. consist of clocking in and getting my are ready for the store to open. I would help to put away inventory that had arrived the night before or early on the morning. During the day I would help customers with any questions about any of the products in my are or show them where the item they were looking for was located. The payoff for me was to get a customers to leave my area more educated about our products and to keep them coming back. I made sure my area was always presentable and made sure I was providing exceptional customer service.
good,"Ok place to work loved to customers and working with the public , enjoy helping customer create and new room .I enjoyed working with the staff."
good,Same thing everyday. Unload the truck and separate the freight. Then go stock our department.
good,This was a part time job that I work while I went to school. Performed sales of home appliances and electronics; stocked appliances and electronic items; placed orders on computer system; answered customer questions regarding various appliances or electronic items; resolved customer complaints; assisted with loading and delivery of products.
good,This job is overall good job. The Management is the reason why i would like to search for a better opportunity.
good,Work life can quickly become like high school. Management team lacked empathy or enthusiasm towards the job and especially the employees
good,"Making burritos, filling and setting up hot bar, preparing food that was needed. Learned food temp,  Food safety. Co-workers were pleasant.  Management not that great. Hardest part of the job  Large  orders not enough time to do them. Most of the time the job    was enjoyable."
good,"My review is from the Project Specialist - Interiors position only as overall I believe Lowe's a a great company with genuine concern for the well being of their employees."
good,Had poor management when i worked there and after I left they changed all of their management.
good,"A typical day at work is very draining not only are you responsible for your own department and sales quota but because they run such a limited staff you are often left taking care of 2- departments by yourself.  Dealing with customer calls, customers in shopping and trying to put installs together with many many interuptions."
good,Ok place to work. pay is ok. management kinda stinks. depending on which ones. i liked the paint dept. pretty cool co-workers. i would recommend this job for someone who is retired looking for some hours or kids going to school. not for a career position. it gets to stressful and the pay is not worth the stress.
good,great potential for bonuses each quarter if your store meets the sales and expense control requirements.
good,Full time hours for the season.  Management attentive.  It was a good job although it was only from April-July.
good,"Hard work goes unrecognized, good place to learn to use power equipment."
good,I was hired to work Monday through Friday and this job offended required weekends as well. Management never agreed on which policies to follow. So it was a confusing environment.
good,"assisting customers with what paint products to use, help customers pick paint and mix paint for the customer. I learned everything there is to know about the finishes in paint and how to properly mix the colors. I learned how to cut blinds. The management changes often so it reflects poorly on the store. My co-workers are not team players but I always assist my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is co-workers not willing to help when your busy and there standing around doing nothing which makes for a long day at the end of the day since we have to face the shelves and clean store before leaving. The most enjoyable part of the job is customers leaving happy with your knowledge of the product you are making for them."
good,"Pay's well, room to advance if you are willing to put in long retail hours. No work/home balance because of the nature of retail. Do not allow accommodations for school, family, ect."
good,"High demand for customer service"
good,"Retail is a tough community, but there will be moments where the hard work will pay off personally. There are many customers that come in and out and some will bring a high light to your day and there will be opportunities to bring happiness to a customer's day. Never put up an expectation for the customer, always know what you  must do for them and let that be the driving effort behind your work."
good,"I am reliable, friendly, and several repeat customers who look for me every time they are in the store.  I am very punctual, never late.  I very rarely call off sick.  I like to show up to work at least 10 minutes early, do my job 100% and go home.  I go out of my way to make the customer happy and satisfied."
good,I cashier and also am a Customer Service Associate in the Outdoor Power Equipment Department. Assisting customers is a personal satisfaction knowing I can find what best fits their needs. Teamwork within my department is there but could be improved. The hardest part of the job is having to pick up the slack for another coworker and being understaffed. The most enjoyable is being able to interact with different people.
good,"beware of corporate restructuring, forget having a family or social life. You belong to the store"
good,I like to take care of the customers and the day to day phone calls.
good,Typical day was ok. Lowe's as a company is a GREAT  place to work. Co workers were AWESOME. Management not so great!! They can always tell you what you're doing wrong but never recognize when you are busting your butt. No room for advancements unless you are a chosen one.. hours are not family oriented but it's to be expected with retail.
good,"Customer Service, cleaned and restocked."
good,"My favorite part of this job was the diversity in employment.  There were a lot of different people with so many backgrounds, which made working together so much fun."
good,Working there had its ups and downs.  Managament was constantly changing and it made it hard sometimes.  When other positions/departments would open up they would never promote within.
good,"I enjoy working with customers and employees who come to work with a happy and willing attitude.  For all the employees who bring their drama and unhappy lives to work, please learn to separate your personal life from work, customers can sense your unhappiness."
good,Good place to work for someone fresh out of high school. Decent pay and benefits.
good,"Enjoy working here, it is a very high fast paced place to work, must be able to multitask, lots of customer service, great team environment"
good,"A normal day here would usually consist of running around the front end for hours n end. Depending on how busy the store was, you could be bounced from the front lanes, to outside, to lumber, and then back to the front. Because I was trained in on Customer Service, I was able to spend shifts wholly at the CS desk, which meant very little bouncing, but lots of calling, paging, and usually an endless flow of returns to be dealt with. "
good,Every day was a new learning experience as the company grew larger and expanded its products. It was always a joy to help customers and educate them on the new upcoming products. Management and co-workers were also a joy to be around. Pay was ok but the hours per week dropped seasonally during less busy times.
good,"a typical day at work was busy, i learned how to deal with customers, management could of been a little better. The coworkers were pretty cool we all got along."
good,I worked there for 3 years and I liked it. The job is not a secure job and it is very hard to move up in any position. The coworkers made the job worth coming to. The management wasn't the greatest and my last year there I saw at least 3 managers get replaced. The job isn't hard depending on the department but it can be overwhelming at times. I learned to be patient and not sweat the small stuff. Never bring the things that happen at this job home with you. It was so much drama at this place that it could've had its on reality show at one point. Just be patient because not all days will be good days there.
good,"the pay isn't awesome. you do get performance reviews and, if qualify, you get a raise (every year i believe). certain times of year are better than others, for my store, summer time meant minimal hours (like 10-15 hours a week for pt). Like many other places with immature people, everyone was talked about like high school."
good,"Most days I put away big products like doors, windows, and buckets of paint away on the shelves and other designated areas.  I've learned how to operate multiple types of power equipment efficiently.  Managment leaves me alone for the most part unless they need to change my schedule.  My coworkers and I have a very good relationship and know each other responsiblities and bounderies.  The hardest part of the job is finding places to put doors when the designated areas are already full.  I enjoy seeing different customers everyday while I work and being around the other employees."
good,"The corporate scheduling makes it almost impossible to create a work-life balance. There is no ""leash"" on the ASM""s, they have no accountability for their actions."
good,The store in itself is okay. The coworkers I work with are pretty cool as well. But just trying to move up in the company is a bit challenging. The job can be stressful at times but it okay.
good,"The likelihood of someone making it to full time is really low. The scheduling is insane. You may work from 7a to 4p, then 8p-10p then 4a to 1p all in the same 3 days. The benefits for a part time employee are just enough to keep the government off of your back but you are better off paying cash for all doctor visits because the cash discount is greater than what your insurance covers. The job itself is remarkably easy, although if you are looking for a career or to be treated like an adult this is not the place for you."
good,lowes is a great place to work. fun staffing and the job is a easy one
good,"Challenging environment. Good people, somewhat worse for wear!"
good,"Good place too work, good benefits, but they don't always help with advancement as they say."
good,most people in the work place were pretty cool. otherwise was a hard job
good,"5 hrs shifts for part-time. Workers,are enjoyable to work with, always willing to lend a hand. Store management has changed three times in the short time I have worked here. There policy on moving up in the store is a little unfair. If you miss more than five days in a year your not able to apply for any opening in the store."
good,"cool summer job, youll learn a lot from customers. could be a good career if you want to stay in customer service."
good,"Great company overall. Management however is in a giant click, out casting some associates. But still a very good and mostly professional place to work for."
good,"There is too many layers of management and you will get thrown under the bus repeatedly"
good,A typical day at work is either opening or closing the store and dealing with the processes to comply with policy and proceedure. My co-worker are good people and the store manager is fair. The toughest part of the job is dealing with many things at the same time and covering alot of real estate in the process. The most enjoyable part of the job is team building. Getting people who report to me to work as a team and accomplish their goals.
good,This is a good place to work I was in a department that was a challenge never boring.
good,good place to work.  not enough incentive to stay.  too much part time.  good people though
good,"Great peers at Lowe's #2532, good place to work and great for college students."
good,"exactly where the company fits on the overall retail spectrum. I worked in a small city in a rural state. The associates I worked with were wonderful, most of the dept and assistant managers were great. But the good ole boy network persists here. The benefits and pay were good."
good,"A typical day would include keeping my area clean, managing cash registers, processing internet sales, and also processing returns for customers. The hardest part of the job is how busy it can be sometimes, there is always multiple things going on at once but I am great at multi tasking so I manage."
good,"I really dont have much to say. Lowes is a home improvement store I enjoy meeting new people. Due to the health care change,so to speak we cannot have over 25 hours"
good,"A typical day at work involves down stocking, changing end caps, completing the safety check list, assisting customers throughout the day, and managing when to take breaks so the departments is covered. The environment is very friendly most of the time and I find it easy to laugh with coworkers and customers while completing my work. Occasionally larger items need to be taken down from top stock so I assist using the powered equipment that is needed for the job. Halfway through the shift you get a relaxing hour lunch to regenerate. The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out what someone is looking for when they can't explain it properly. I really enjoy helping out customers who are working on a project I can relate to. I liked to get involved and offer different ideas on the project so the customer can choose which way he thinks will work best. The schedule is updated every week and my shifts always vary so it's hard to make plans in advance without requesting time off."
good,Has increased my general building knowledge. I enjoy the team members.
good,Boat N RV was a very fun place to work. The merchandise was fun to work with
good,Answering calls and setting up service work orders.  Conducting inventory. unloading new Bobcat equipment and accessory.
good,"Lowe's is a fun concept, as a shopper. As an associate, I feel as if my full potential cannot be reached. When making suggestions to improve the work life of my co-workers and myself, all ideas have been thrown away. I feel as my invested interest is taken to lightly. There's no truing available for educating ourselves unless it's done at home on our own time. I worked for 3 different Lowe's because of location and have not received a raise."
good,Lowe's has been a good Experience as far as retail and learning to directly interact with the customers
good,Likes the job and the people i worked with. I was continually passed by for advancement for people that were favorites within the company.
good,Management was really bad couldn't work with you school schedule. I have worked for the Company in general for over 3 years but never have they ever offered me a promotion.
good,"I have been a responsible customer service representative with 7 years of experience working in fast-paced environments. I’m a solid team player with great positive attitude. I was a hardworking customer service representative for five years for Lowe's and  Fairfield Resorts. My job was to schedule appointments for the company, daily data entry, giving great customer service to all our clients, motivated customer service representative in a fast-paced environment, filing paperwork, and I took daily inventory on cash, gift cards and etc."
good,"Lowes was an awesome place to work!!!!I learned alot about internal corporate clicks!!!!Co-workers are awesome.Hardest part of the job are the constant lying from management ,doing what they want and when they want(example)off on the weekend when they change your schedule,then right you up for not working your new schedule???????????"
good,"Lowe's is a stable employer. This employer is flexible with their hours and will accommodate any needs in which their employee may request. A typical day in my department (Customer Service Desk) includes answering multiple phone lines, multitasking, processing payments, returns, invoices and internet orders. I am also responsible for following-up on customer deliveries and providing customers with information regarding special orders, dates and times in which their orders will arrive at the store, faxing and e-mailing manifests to our third party delivery services. Communicating with vendors regarding customer orders and relaying that information to the customer in a way in which it is easily comprehended."
good,"Early start, early release. Enjoyable atmosphere. Some departments ran better than others. Remember to always smile and remain positive. Safety means Nothing Happens."
good,Very long work days and a culture of hands off management. The one weekend off a month is great. Be careful not to want to promote change. Very resistant to change and accountability very different type of management.
good,"Management does not take you as seriously if you're a young employee, but I'm not talking about Management as a whole since there are others that are great to work with. Co-workers are great and the job becomes a routine."
good,"There is not a typical day in retail it is always different."
good,"My typical work week was 4 ten hour shifts from Monday Night to Thursday Night. 2 days a week I assorted Pallets of Toilets and sinks to specific Store Pallets. 1 day a week , I performed the flooring orders that were either ordered through a store or by a Customer.And the remaining day , I either put away product in a specific area of the Building or Picked product using a Stand Up Reach Truck. Very Efficient and Dependable worker while I was there."
good,"Enjoyed being a Headcashiers, getting along with my coworkers. It made my day go by faster helping them out.   I leanered alot about customer  service .  The hardest part was applying to for positions that you have experience for ,they would  favor people.  My most enjoyable part  was my customer having a smile on there face when  i took care of them."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of checking out merchandise for customers and making sure all end cap items are stocked. The most important take away as a cashier is understanding customer service and how to always leave a lasting impression. The management at Lowe's is fair. My co-workers are great and I truly enjoy working with them. We are definitely a team when it comes to carrying out any jobs required. Working with Lowe's frequent customers, and truly having a great work staff(co-workers) are the most enjoyable parts of my job. This lessens the workload and makes the time spent less stressful and more positive."
good,It is easy to learn a lot of new things in a short amount of time working at a place like Lowe's
good,Stocking merchandise from trucks to shelves and top stock. Assisting customers with their questions and home improvement needs.
good,"A typical day at work is great, I enjoy keeping busy, I have no problem working with co-workers. I am a not a busy body, but enjoy seeing my customers are happy with product and when there is a problem I try to find a solution."
good,I been with Lowes for now 5 months and if you work the front end you cant do anything. You have to red line the hole shift and the ones that management like they can walk all over you.
good,"A typical day at work was once i got up there I usually tried to figure out what i would work on first depending on what needed done the most."
good,"Day begins with deciding what task will be first and prepare for it, then go tackle task. Can do 3 or 4 task a day or just start on a 40 hour task that will take the whole week."
good,"My typical day was to sell sell sell...I loved my job and co-workers. I enjoyed meeting new people and helping them with their projects. Fast paced environment which I enjoy. Learned a little about everything in a big box store. Dealt with big contractors on big jobs like the new Hilton in Mccandless ,Aquion in Lawerenceville. Big apartment complexes example,  prudential and many others. The variety made it fun and interesting"
good,"They cut commission back in 2011 when the company was going under by spending too much money... That took out a LOT of good salespeople who knew what they were talking about... Can't say a lot know (3 years later), but I will say that as long as you don't order the incorrect product for a customer (wrong stain on cabinets, wrong hinging on door, etc) or smoke on property then it is next to impossible to be written up for anything. Raises are usually pretty good, for being retail ($0.30-$0.80)... but you have to suck up to management AND sell you butt off to get it..."
good,"I was cross trained in several departments since the managment knew I was a fast learner and could always be counted on.  A typical day for me would be in hardware cutting keys and assisting customers trying to find what they needed, then going to cut wood when someone needed, mixing paint, helping customers pick out and calculate how much flooring they would need as well as running my own department and helping my customers pick out and order their window treatments as well as cutting them if they were in stock items.  I never had a boring day and my managers would even comment during our daily store meetings that other associates needed to pick up the slack and answer the call buttons when a customer needed help instead of just me.  The hardest part was trying to be multiple places and run multiple departments all at the same time.  Each department had a phone and it wasn't foreign for me to be carrying 3-4 phones at once and running all those departments either because someone called off or was on their lunch break.  The only bad part was the store manager that gossiped about as much as the majority of the staff.  If you did go to him with a problem you would find out the next day the entire store then knew about it."
good,"A typical day at Lowe's started off slow at first. Everyone gets inventory ready in the early morning before many customers come in. Management would gather all the employees and inform them on sales, accomplishments, areas that needed help in, and lunch breaks. The most difficult part of the job was not being able to get ahold of anyone on the floor because the store was under staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and keeping up good relations with them."
good,"The co-workers were great to work with and the customers were fine, it was the management that drove me away. All but one manager was even the slightest bit decent and actually cared how the employees were treated"
good,just a number not a good feeling. Seems to be difficult to advance.
good,"I worked there for five years and the fact is that management is all over and doesn't really seem to have a core system of dealing with the ""bad"" employees.  Someone is always passing work off to others or just slacking and the hard workers are usually the first ones fired.  They do try to help you with family life but it is really a Lowes or nothing kind of job.  The people can be good but the knowledge base is low and the customers expect a DIY HGTV home from a small white collar area.  Just a rough environment busy or slow."
good,"Good corporate rotation scheduling, 1 hour lunches.  paid time off, health and financial benefits from the get-go.  Most retail companies don't go this far for their employees."
good,"Felt like certain team members would not pull their own weight and too many people depended on one individual to carry the load. Overall great job while I was in school trying to raise a family and work full time. Upon graduation of college, was not able to move up in the company because of the fear of me leaving the company."
good,working in the garden department at Lowes was a great part time job. they made it easy to balance work and school while i got the chance to learn a bit about gardening and how to operate a counter-balance fork truck. however the work got a lot slower after memorial day and because i was only seasonal I did not get as many hours.
good,Each and every day that u come in be prepared to work alone and have little to no help. Over half of the time u will learn or teach yourself how things are done. Managers some will work and do what ever their fellow associate will do. But others will just give orders and walk away. will not show how it needs to be done or how they want it done just expect you to do it. their really is no hard part about the job long as everybody work as a team. the most enjoyable part is being able to help any one person that walks in your department and see them happy at the end of the day.
good,"Good if you're in school, WE Team associates work weekends - (Fri,Sat,Sun) 20 hrs/week."
good,"Provide store support and product maintenance; complete management requests from vendors to relocate products to increase sales; conduct quality and inventory control as needed; ensure operational readiness of displays, & provide customer assistance	Track, communicate, and assist in resolving safety issues"
good,most enjoyable part of job was assisting customers in a professtional manner every day.  adding on sales
good,I would be outside in the garden loading pallets of mulch and other garden materials into customers' vehicles. I provided great customer service.
good,Lowe's offered me a great deal of training on customer service. i enjoyed working with customer on a daily basis.
good,overall its a fun place to work but a lot of stress and work pressure
good,"I like a job where I am very busy and this is it. I work hard and wish all my associates did the same, it would make it easier for everyone."
good,"Lowe's is a good job, but not a career. Management is inconsistent, and you never know which manager you are to listen to. My goal is to provide the best customer service and make sure when they leave lowe's they have no reason to stop anywhere else to shop."
good,I really enjoy all aspects of Human Resources. I work great under pressure and learn something new everyday.
good,"Deliver customer merchandise. Unload and load trucks, stock all product on shelves."
good,"very productive work place, very fast pace, always on the go. this is a place that requires you to multitask at all times.  "
good,"Ok place to work.  Difficult to advance if you are not in the ""in"" crowd. "
good,"If you are going to college or looking for a part time job, this is an excellent place to work but not a place if you are looking for a career unless you enjoy retail.  Hard place to advance."
good,I have learned that management cannot seem to make a sound decision. My co-workers do their jobs well but dont want to take any kind of criticisim.
good,"Typically, I had no human contact throughout the day. Worked on my computer in a cubicle all day. The only human contact I had was via email and text. This job was my dream job, but I also am a very independent and outspoken person. This job did not allow me to be myself with extreme regulations. I could wear nothing with orange, no visible tattoos (even though I had no contact with the public whatsoever), no open toed shoes, no more than one earring in each ear,  as well as no unnatural colors in my hair. This may sound petty to some, but to me it takes my character away and has nothing to do with my work ability and my education. I take pride in who I am, thus the reason I walked away from this company. "
good,"Flexible schedules"
good,"I enjoy tking care of customers, to help with their needs, when you have a happy customer they always come back looking for you to help out with what they are looking for."
good,"Lowes is retail warehouse style store, specializing in building materials. I started my career at Lowes as a building materials loader. This job would be considered the ground floor.Within my first year I was able to work hard and move my way up to an Assistant department Manager in the Lumbar and Millwork departments . As my career progressed I then moved up to what Lowes calls a Sales Specialist. As a Sales Specialist I was responsible for selling the products the Lowes offered. I would place orders, design projects, manage client lists, make sales calls, and more. The hardest part about this job was keeping every client as happy as possible. With items being shipped from one place to another, there would be delays from time to time. This would could sometimes cause and entire project to come to a halt. For the most part the entire job was very enjoyable. Getting to meat new people all the time, hitting my sales quota for the month, and being able to solve problems were all aspects of the job that I enjoyed. "
good,"Lowe's is not a bad place to work for someone who may be in college and needs something to do in the evenings or on the weekends. It has served me well for the last year and a half of college, but I am ready to move on to a ""big girl"" job. I would not want to make a career out of Lowe's, but for someone who does not mind working different hours it would be a good job."
good,i enjoy meeting new people and lasting friendships with the new people that come in and out of our bay doors.
good,"Help customers find product. Sell installs or Sos material. Fill stock."
good,answer phones and fax papers and help people find things in the store was a typical day. If short staffed customers would have to wait and may get upset so i would try my hardest to find extra help and help as many people as possible 
good,"is a very busy retail store, will learn a lot of  home improvement , A great job to move up in the company. "
good,I really enjoy interacting with customers and providing them the supplies they need. I learned a lot about customer service and what it takes to satisfy all different types of customers. I really enjoyed my co workers. It was like a big family. 
good,A typical day at work is start off by putting at the cull (damaged) product in the system. Next cleaning the commercial loading area and getting read for the day. After that pulling commercial sales orders and helping contractors load materials. Hardest part of my job is trying to help customers or contractors in a fast a sufficient time when we are busy. The most enjoyable part of my job is building good relationships with customers and co workers.  
good,they were strict on 40 hrs i like my overtime. I did learn about teamwork the store is big and we got truck orders daily. If your not a team player then you cant make it at lowes.
good,"Company is solid, but has a compensation / responsibility gap that does not retain valued employees."
good,"Worked 50-70 hours a week depending on the area and the season. You could work anywhere from 5am to 11pm. The rotating schedule had is pros of being off during week but only one weekend off a month is hard. If you are an ASM, expect to close a lot. Most store manager's never work past 5pm. Expect to always be the one changing because the customer and employee is always right. I enjoyed most are the friendships I made through working there, even though it is frowned upon when management makes friends."
good,"I can't say it's any different than any big box store however at most lowe's they seem to hire good people. Fellow coworkers are honest and will tend to lend a hand to each other. In recent years compensation has been trending downwards and trying to drive old employees out in lieu of cheaper, un-skilled employees. Customer service is key here and picking up skills in all departments is ESSENTIAL as you'll be helping customers outside your department more often than not."
good,"Doing price changes in itself is an exciting job, but can be demanding."
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work with many opportunities. The days however are long and the ""Work Life Balance"" is not satisfactory. The employees are great and work together well as a team."
good,"Getting people to work together in a push and shove environment also training people and getting them promoted .Receiving complaints in all directions and providing solutions. Getting to know my community is the best part of the job as a customer service representative , by providing a clam atmosphere in a fast pace commercial environment one ensures better sales numbers for the store."
good,Overall Managed Shrink and Safety Program for lone urban store in NYC area. High risk with high crime demographic in surrounding area mixed with 3 major high ways near by led to high volume of shoplifting cases.
good,most of the time it was good then others it was like high school plenty of gossip and childish behavior
good,"Ok place to work for, and very easy. All you do is help out customers and stock shelves, the managers can be a little annoying because the store manager ride them all day. The people I work with were fun to be around and made the day go by faster, the only enjoyable part is meeting new people."
good,"Good Job, nice experience, and greatful for the opportunity"
good,Good company. Good co-workers.
good,"When I applied, I applied for a cashier position but was placed in the Lawn and Garden center. I had no clue about any of the products in the area and often had issues with costumers. Most employees were helpful when I asked for help, others acted rude and wouldn't help. Training videos were extensive but the computers would freeze constantly. Overall the job was decent, not horrible but not the most rewarding job."
good,"A typical day would to assist customers with purchases, returns, selecting merchandise, answering phones and rental on selective items. The management wasn't bad but needed to work on the communication a little and the coworkers weren't bad either, just have the occasional ""old fashioned"" one. Hardest part of the job would be stocking and lifting heavy stuff or pushing carts not in ideal weather. Most enjoyable part of the job would be you get in the routine of doing the same thing all the time."
good,"I have been with this company for 7 years, and i have gained a lot of knowledge in differrent aspects of construction and home improvement. The store enviornment for the most part is ok."
good,"At first when I got this job, I loved it. But the longer I worked the more and more I started to hate it. This is my first job and I was very happy to have it. Now I have started to look for other work because I hate the hours they have me work."
good,"A typical day at work was dealing with contractors, taking orders for lumber, helping load orders, running of cash register. Customer service helping customers find the product they are looking for. Got along very well with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was helping customers load their purchases. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the contractors. I learned a lot about lumber, and other aspects of building."
good,"I work in many departments due to understaffing, my co-workers tend to find it easy to hide from work since management is hardly around. The hardest part of the job is the lack of team work and the most enjoyable is the time I leave to go home."
good,"Not too bad, but can be very stressful. Company is changing with the economy and keeps trying to keep up with technology. Its good, but it has affected a lot of good workers."
good,"Many things are changing as Lowe's matures through it's growth as a company coming into this new modern world. Lowe's has taught a lot about how to become a better team player, leader and self sufficient. However with the changes over the past couple of years of seaming to please Wall Street and focusing on bring money back to the company they have forgot about the people on the sales floor as they squeeze things out, meaning making less and adding more to responsibility. At a corporate level the company is behind their employees with benefits but at a store level managers lack some very frustrating skills like being a mentor as they struggle to hold on to their jobs and take pay cuts. I still stand behind Lowe's as they're the ones that pay me and would like to see them succeed. My time has also come to make the decision to better myself in a field of study I'm currently in. Remember it's not always about the long term employees that are given the best performance over 20 years, its the ones their between 3-4 years trying hard to move up the ladder and leaving to get where they need to be with new opportunities."
good,operated reach truck to do replenishment's from the shift before. Also loaded trucks and pulled orders.
good,"Ive been at Lowes for 11 months. Ive seen soo many people come and go! Even upper management hasnt remained the same. Im a cashier and every time you look around they are implementing a new policy. I feel as though they should at least tell us when a new policy is taking affect especially if it affects us. Alot of the cashiers at my store just got wrote up for failing a Cart test. They say this is a new policy but they pulled up a cart test from September. The pay is good. As a cashier you have to wait for relief to go to the restroom or go on break.. alot of times, we are short handed so getting relief is a hard task."
good,A typical day at work is checking the list of current deliverys for the day and knowing that adjustments will be made to satisfy customer need. Management is very prompt on notifying of any issues that may or have occured within the company. I have learned that customers have a great part in the security of all jobs that we have. The hardest part of my job is when the order is incorrect and quick action has to be made to get delivery done on time. My co-workers are very down to earth people.
good,"began early, ended late. worked customer service desk, enjoyed helping the customers, was difficult at times as Store management did not stand by corporate policy and procedures. The co workers I worked with were great, knowledgeable and professional. It was difficult to watch management contradict employees when they were supporting corporate policy."
good,"Management does not communicate with each other and you get different answers to the same question when you ask different managers. Must be available before opening to after closing 7 days a week to be eligible for a full time position. Only positive thing is your schedule follows a 4 week rotation, so you can sort of predict what days and hours you will be working. Co-workers are the best part of the job! Some positions are under paid for the job they do. And there is no set compensation for each position. there are only guidelines that the store manager is to following when extending a job offer. Usually it is offered at the lower end of the pay scale, depending who the store manager is."
good,"I enjoyed the customer interaction,Pay was good and besides lack of hours for a person to make aliving it was a good place to work. They keep hiring people for partime position when they have employees who are willing to work full time hours,who are alredy trained. If the insurance was offered to all employees it made no sense to me to keep hiring more employees and not use what they alredy had."
good,"I learned alot there from answering phones,directing phone calls, casher, cash handling, deliveries,credit apps,just a fast place days went by pretty fast.Co-workers were not that great there was alot of favortism."
good,"I was millwork specialist at Lowes in Suwanee Georgia. Although management had the best aspirations for the store and company, some employees would appear to be getting by with little or no effort while others were carrying enough workload for them."
good,"Come in, review what has to be done for the day and then work to complete it."
good,"Although flexibility is one thing, theirs not much offered other then decent pay and benefits at Lowes."
good,"Good pay, good benefits, bad hours. Hardest part of job was the hours. Most enjoyable part was interacting with customers."
good,The oppurtunity for growth in the company is scarces. Need a bigger challenge.
good,"Daily activities consists of putting away daily freight. Learned how to mix paint, increased customer service skills, constant lifting. Learned a great deal about home improvement. Co-workers were for the most part fun to work with but dealt with a great deal racism. The hardest part of the job consists of completing disgruntled customers orders who's order was not done incompletely. The most enjoyable part of the job was engaging with customers, completing my work in a timely fashion."
good,was ok but boring. managers were really laid back. nice atmosphere
good,Like working with family. Everyone works as a team for the good of the company.
good,the best part of the job i had was when i helped a customer find something they needed... got along with all my co-workers and our typical day at work would start off by having our morning meetings.
good,Decent place if you need a job to pay some bills. Low paying job. Lots of customer interaction. Not for the working professional.
good,"Loved what I was doing as a department managers. But they would work you to death before they changed the work hours. Some nights would not leave untill 3am and was scheduled back to work that same moring to open. Upper management would make the people who would work, work harder then getting the people that would not do anything to do anything at all. Most upper management not all, would just walk around the store and not do anthing but dictate what to do then lead by example and help out. Anyone that was a hard worker ended up quitting including myself, it was not worth the stress. To many chief and not enough indians."
good,The job itself was easy and at times even fun. Helping people was a great experience in learning about different home improvement projects. The management tended to play favorites to certain co-workers. They also hired from outside the company more often than not. I had a problem closing when I lost my son's babysitter and applied for two jobs that worked strictly days and they looked over me and did not even give me an interview for it. The jobs did not require any special skill set and I more than qualify. I ended up having to leave because of it.
good,You have to complete 3 daily tasks that could take about an hour each.
good,A typical day at work for me is stressful because nobody at my job are team player . I learn a lot from my job don't get me wrong but it would be a better working place if everybody was more nicer to each other. The most hardest part of my job is making sure I'm doing the right thing in every moment. The most enjoyable part of my job is when i make a customer smile
good,"Job included: phone operations, truck and equipment rentals, customer service desk, returns, deliveries, pick-ups, loading, security cage maintenance, item look-up, product knowledge, and was proactive with working with L.P. to prevent shrink. Management was not very good at the store I work at, there were a lot of things going on that should not have on a professional level between employees and management. The best part of the job was helping customers. I learned that Lowe's is not a bad company to work for, but poor management and unnecessary write-up ensuring that you could not advance within the company for another 6 months when employees applied for advancements."
good,"Greet Serve Customers, Sales and Promotions, Complete my department assignments and assist in other departments."
good,"-loved the sales manager position, they got rid of this position."
good,"Typical day consisted of helping customers, processing orders, operating machinery.. ect."
good,"• Promoted to Department Supervisor, responsible for overseeing a department consisting of five employees"
good,"Waking up at 5 a.m. and clockin in about 5:55 a.m. Listen to the coaches tell us what is out in the yard, how many cubes. Then go to the work area and make sure everything is clean and ready to be worked around. Making sure everything is in its proper position that way we can be working safe thru out the day. Learned how to work with a team and how to help others get their job done as well. There was really no hard part of the day. The most enjoyable part was just going home and relaxing."
good,My first year was great! Endless amounts of cross training and advancement. Since then it has been down hill. Lowe's LEF included many lay offs and cuts in compensation and benefits.
good,"Its a job nothing special its average working there, i been there for 5 years its nice i get 3 weeks of vacation time, i have one hour lunches, the management is good to me. my co-workers are very nice and helpfull, i learned how to deal with the customer that come in the store"
good,"management couldnt tell you your name, or make proper decisions, terrible place to work, pay was lousy"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of being told to stay in one position the entire day, and generally getting scolded if you failed to comply to this, while the overall goal is to help customers find things they need and to advance sales."
good,An ok company to work for. Compensation was not the best even for those who had been with the company for years. Seemed to be short handed on a daily bases. Management was very diverse.
good,"Half the time your doing your job up to Lowe's standards and you turn around a customer is biting your head off b/c theres no help. And thats the way it has to be, b/c the CEO and Executives need to make there seven figures and ignore whats going on at the frontlines, but thats ok b/c I wont be there forever!!"
good,Nice place to work. The people I work with are great. Pay is decent for retail. It is really hard to move up in this company.
good,"I had a full-time job but decided to get this one as a part-time job. I had never worked in retail before and thought maybe I could learn something new. I started as a cashier and handled money on a daily basis by operating the cash register. I then had the chance to work in the appliance dept. as a loader/order puller and would on occasion work the sales desk. I worked well with my co-workers,customers,and management. The hardest part of the job was at times it would get extremly busy pulling orders and it was physical labor. The best part was it was a clean,professional envorinmet and there was a variety of duties."
good,"low compensation, complicated sheduling not un expected from corporate retail, fun envirment and caring immediate management"
good,Arriving at 9pm brief then unload truck with pallet equipment.Learned safety procedures for stocking and certified for heavy lifting machinery.Management was alright just had a problem with my promotion when it was due.Co-workers were great and im easy to get along person.Hardest part of job was getting use to the night shift.Most enjoyable part was havin the weekend off but not a necessasity
good,"My typical day at Lowe's is basically report to work, do the job that you are being asked to do, like dealing with customers and making sales, clean up and go home. The hardest part of the day is dealing with difficult customers, co-workers, and management. The most enjoyable part of the job besides going home is seeing a satified customer after making a big sale."
good,With the right managers Lowes in Pikeville would be a great place to work..I learned a lot and love working with people after 6 years it was time for a change.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is taking care of my customers.
good,"The job I had was nice, but the rate of turnover was not. Even the managers were let go frequently. Better human resource practices should have been implemented to keep their dedicated employees."
good,"The hours are always different, no set schedule if you are part time. Sometimes you close and then have to open next day which can be hard. Sometimes you don't get a break when working 5 hours, not allowed to have a drink at register unless you have a doctor's excuse. Hard to get a full time position as a cashier, regardless how hard you work. I find morale is low. I like most of my co-workers, we get along well and try to see the positive. Pay is reasonable but pay raise is laughable."
good,Lowes is a great place to work. Unless you are in Commercial Sales. With the economy as it is sales are not up to Lowes requirements. The pressure to make sales is difficult to contend with especially since they tell you what you should be selling every day. Other then that...
good,"Lowes is a decent company to work for, but they in no way compensate their employees enough for all the hard work that they have to do daily. Lowes is really good about working with people's schedules and seem to have lenient availability policies. Lowes is trying to weed out all of their long term employees and replace them with newer people so they don't have to lose as much money via personnel."
good,Great place to learn about customer service. Lowes is a company that provides excellent trainning to all of there employees.
good,It depends who is in charge other then that lowe's is a great place to work.
good,"fast pace, meeting a lots people I love to help customers that come with questions. the isles are clean and in order. easy to find what you are looking for."
good,Lowe's is a good working environment and does have advancements within the company for those looking for a career path but is mostly for those who just need a part-time job while going to school or haveing another full-time job.
good,The location I work at is filled with drama and managers trying to get into your personal business. Don't go to management if someone is talking bad about you because they will blame you for it. Overall a good company but the employees are horrible as well as some managers.
good,Very fun place to work plus you can cancel your gym membership. Lifting bricks and heavy bags of mulch is alot of fun and a great way to stay in shape. Working outdoors especially at night is peaceful. You will learn alot about landscaping and mulch.
good,"A lot of instability with constant changing in company policy and procedures after executive staff change. Many benefits that employees were given, that made Lowe's different from many other retailers have been taken away. "
good,One of the best thing about Lowes is the great people you work with. Having been with the company three year I have yet to work with someone that I can not get along with. A typical day includes helping customers with projects and answering questions about home improvement and providing adobe and guidance throughout a project. There is a strong push to generate leads and make sales.
good,The overall environment is acceptable. Management is mostly supportive. Scheduling can be brutal depending on the position you have. There are opportunities to move throughout the store.
good,"Not a bad place to work, as long as you have a good management team. The work is moderate and most of the associates are easy to get along with and so are the customers for the most part."
good,Not an entirely awful place to work. Fair amount of time working. Not awful. I spent allot of time out of my house working and handling people. Having fun
good,As a starting job if you are in high school this is a great place but otherwise don't think of this as your life long job. Management was the worse everyone was two faced. No Manager had your back.
good,"Store specific cultures, luck of the draw. Store managers drive the culture. I worked at one store that was great then moved and the store manager doesn't allow creativity."
good,Easy work to unload trucks. The other employees were a little lazy and slow but it made the shift go by pretty fast. It is definitely a lot of work to move boxes.
good,"It'll be the hardest job you've ever had. You'll work 10 hour shifts, deal with troublesome customers, cover 3 departments by yourself. But it'll be worth it in the end."
good,"Excellent co-workers and management. Challenging work, but never a dull moment. If you like dealing with the public, their questions will always keep you on your toes."
good,"A typical day as a Merchandising Servicing  Associate involves friendly and professionally engaging with vendors, customers; creating visually appealing product selections that are safe,clean and easy for customers to access; collaborating with  individual department associates when we are completing resets or servicing existing resets; informing managers when issues regarding such things as damages to structure or other issues that with reduce the safety or appeal-ability of the displays,etc."
good,Enjoyed my time at the company. The hours and pay did not meet my needs but could accommodate someone who needs a part time seasonal job. I would recommend the company to someone looking for employment.
good,"For the most part, the store level is a good work environment. Lots of positions are eliminated often and morale can be affected. Plans are emplemented with out much notice."
good,"All together I actually enjoyed working there, unfortunately I parted ways due they did not offer me the hours that I needed. Overall Lowes is a great place of employment."
good,Used to build over 200 doors a day and have fun doing it. I worked there as a temporary and had the opportunity to move up but had another job waiting on me.
good,Lowe's is a nice place to work and the people and the location I am at are good to work with.  Advancement is hard to come by and ways to learn the necessary skills to do so are lacking.  The work environment is good though.
good,"Lowe's tends to under staff which makes it very difficult to get your daily tasks done during days where there is a lot of customers. On slower days there is always plenty of work to do regarding stocking and organizing products, returns, etc."
good,Good company to work for didn't work there for long had a good experience just not the job I was looking for everyone was great to work with some were more helpful then other.
good,"Very flexible with hours considering I am a college student. It was a great place to work during the school year, but id rather work somewhere else because when I was there I was working 30+ a week which is a lot for a full time student."
good,Not a bad place to work overall people are nice as well as customers  managers are nice too and pay is decent  but moving up can be kind of difficult to do
good,I enjoyed my time with Lowe's. The management was friendly and fair. They have plenty of training. The hours are all over the place. You will work some days some nights and weekends.
good,My review was fair and accurate. My superior was very complementary of my job on a daily basis. He often rewards me during morning meetings. It was a good experience
good,Unfair and un organized.  From the time I started they change store manager 3 times and in total I probably only worked there a year. That should say something.
good,"Poor management. Favoritism, no support. No room for advancement, great hrs, bad work rotation,  associates are friendly, work load is easy but not spread evenly throughout associates."
good,"The cashier's and associates are great people, they make you enjoy your job. However, management? Forget about it. If you aren't a favorite, you don't get any amount of respect. They don't help, they'll push off issues to the next person and just try to make themselves look good for the store manager. The store really has its ups and downs."
good,"Overall the people there were not bad to work with, mostly the higher up people were the reason why I left. They would talk to you like you were a little kid. Was not treated as an equal."
good,"Lowes is overall a good company to work for. I was originally hired as a part time employee in their lumber department. A few weeks in they had an opening in their millworks (Doors & Windows) department and I was asked if I would like to transfer over. They want to get their employees experience in as many departments as possible so you can help assist customers, even outside your department. Like any retail job you can go to work early one day and close the next."
good,I am a great sales person when it comes to selling appliances. Lowes is very flexible with your school hours so thats a bonus. The associates at lowes also help you when you're feeling lost in something you're not sure about.
good,I hurt my back working on the unload crew and requested multiple times that I get switched out of the unload crew but months went by nothing happened so I hurt my back again
good,When i first started i loved to come to work. But as time went by the moral continues to go down. Everyone has a bad mood and are only there until something else comes along.
good,"This is a good job if you just want to stock shelves and clean. i don""t feel i learned anything at this job. The hours were rough on myself and family."
good,"Nothing bad, but nothing too great. Company is disorganized. Stores dont ever feel like everyone is working towards a common goal. No clear direction from upper management."
good,"I worked outside in the garden center and enjoyed fresh air and exercise. "
good,It was a jib that i took on from being out of work. It was nothing to the realm of advancing. I wanted something i could evolve from and climb the ladder for potential supv . it was none of that. So i felt it's not something i want to do for a longtime.
good,"Workplace is pretty good, Dealing with some management is hard depending on the day. Haven't learn alot at all. Alot of micromanaging and worrying about things that get done on a daily basis."
good,It was a cool easy place to work most of the time but gets crazy on the holidays and my experience you have to find your own work to do since there's usually not that much to do
good,"Restructuring Management with no real plans caused a lot of good people to leave the company. After displacing a lot of talented people, they brought back the Department manager under a new title Department supervisor."
good,"Lowes is the type of place where its all about customer services. Giving great customer service is the number one thing they want us to do, so if you dont mind helping people Lowes is the place for you."
good,"-Fun and most enjoyable place to work"
good,"Really keeps you on your toes, always provides customers with satisfaction.  The employees are always willing to help customers find the right products."
good,"Seasonal part time job.  Hours changed every two weeks.  I don't hae much more to say.  It was hot, but I lost weight and got new experience in customer service."
good,"Although they pay based off experience which is usually great, it is a hard place to move and grow, management do not really appreciate their staff. They are usually short staffed and have associate doing more than their job description requires."
good,"Very dynamic atmosphere, fast paced. The upper management changes the store management structure ever 5-7 years, and changes directions and priorities quite frequently,"
good,"Good place to work, always new policies and changes, high turnover rate, and hard to switch positions. New CEO of the company that is implementing a lot of changes."
good,"Good hours, management was horrible, good group of employees to work with, very understaffed, very inconsistent when it comes to accepting time off request when it’s placed months in advance"
good,"Varied hours, Confusing work schedule and rude Piers. The job itself was not hard, the customers treating me like a child and the managers being passive aggressive made my job hard."
good,The employees that work there are very helpful and understanding so it makes the whole interview experience and job feel alot better. The managers were very nice at all times
good,My time was spent helping customers find they’re home needs. We were worked in a good team environment and were happy to help the customers. Big emphasis on customer first
good,"- Middle-management drives a fun, supportive culture."
good,"Job was great nothing i would change about it . The team great , fast work pace and more . We had a great time as a whole team , we was all on the same page"
good,Management was a huge issue. Moral was steadily going down for the whole store. I watched a lot of people leave who were there for years. Would not recommend.
good,I am a hard worker for Garden and i have bypass opportunities that can give growth to Lowes but management does not see my experience that i can make LOwes be great.
good,the workplace was ok and fun.  They normally did help with a lot of the needs that I needed.  When I worked there it was a new location I am not sure of how it is now
good,Had great benefits and great hours. Hard part of job was seasonal hiring and turnover ratings. Management staff was great at the Lowe's store 138. i just recently got laid off.
good,"Hard work, Advancement at your pace, Knowledge of computer systems/Genises. Management is very demanding. Need to work flexible hours and weekends. Self motivater."
good,"Lowe's is a great company with a full package of benefits, including dental and vision. You have an accrued sick pay but trying to use it is hard. You need a doctors slip most of the time. Paid vacation, but you need to request ahead of time and if anybody asks before you in a dept. you will be refused. I believe there are three jobs that have weekends off. Receiving and the RTM and the rest of the store works all hours and days. Safety in the building was first. We went through several managers in my 14 years. The front end management and workers have their own boundaries and most of the time, hard to get along with if you were not part of their crew. I was the RTM and had an office back in receiving. All the folks that worked in receiving and the back room were tight and family oriented. It took me 14 years to finally break into $13 dollars and hour.   There is no encouragement handed down from the management and most of ours was never seen as they were busy having pizza parties etc. in their offices.Back in the day, you could not date coworkers and when I left management and coworkers were dating and living together. The statement that most coworkers made was the store was ruled by fear and if you asked for a raise you were always told you could be replaced. Of course with the shortage of jobs today, that might have changed. I liked the corporate side of the company but the store took a huge dive when they cut off all dept managers and fired them all with no announcement or allowed them to pick up a normal floor job with a huge pay loss. Most of the great dept. mangers walked"
good,Good place to work  good atmosphere good people to work with I cleaned 4 bathrooms a day and also  scrub the floors daily I ran and took care of a   Zan Boon automatic floor scrubber
good,Decent place to work but there is certain management that play favorites other than that i was okay to work there . Be leary of management though some dont  play fairly
good,Sometimes managers have no respect for the workers when being understaffed. Some of the workers are very friendly so there was good days and being able to meet new people.
good,"Paid by vendors like home depot. Pays more than home depot for merchandising position. Work 5am-2pm must work outside in extreme cold or heat, heavy labor. Must be good with hands lots of hours on feet. 30min break 1 hour lunch. New hires make a max pay of $14 per hour. Lots of changes in the role right now. Slow technology. Systems crash often, making it difficult to do your job."
good,"Lowe's priority is to make sure they sell sell sell, same goes for every business, but how can we sell seasonal types of products on off seasons? But the pay is okay"
good,"Lowe'sia a completely average company to work for. It's not wonderful, but it also is not terrible. I am being forced to use 150 characters to continue my job search. There's not much else to say about the company."
good,I loved a lot of my coworkers and working was absolutely fun.  HR didn't really exist due to our HR manager being there two days a week and eventually leaving us.  I reported a coworker for harassment and nothing got done.  I dreaded coming to work to be completely honest.
good,Lowe's is a fun place to work for if the management is right. I have gone through a few store managers. Some are strict while others are laid back. I learned a lot of management skills but I had to do it on my own since they did not provide the proper training.
good,Working at Lowe’s was an good experience. The work space was family and friend friendly. I was in charge of customer service and ordering products for customers.
good,I found this job to be good for high school and college kids it's mostly inside work some outside depends on the department of your choice good fit for older retired.
good,Lowes is an ok place to work. I learned a lot about tools and various home  issues. I would say lowes is ok to work at if you are transitioning between school and something else
good,Good job to have and plenty of work. Good people and the work is not hard. They are more than fair with points for missing days. Good healthcare and other features.
good,i had fun i just did not like the management they never told other mangers what was going on so it mad some days hard but for the most part i liked all my coworkers
good,"Worked my way up from CSA I to Department Manager in a short period of time. In a few years Lowe's came through and restructured the company and I and others were immediately dropped to a CSA . We were supposed to be able to reapply for positions, in most cases the store manager brought his own people from his previous store."
good,"I worked there for five years, the company was alright till I got hurt, I tore my rotator cuff on the job, I was supposed to be on light duty, but, instead I got threatened to get written up or fired if I didn't do my job, so, I got a lawyer and sued them"
good,Not a bad place to work. Some long hours and on your feet most of the shift. Management was decent and usually worked with you on scheduling. Pay was decent.
good,Lowes is a giving back to the community type business. The job is easy and it's very easy to make friends which make doing the job a lot easier. The hours are hard.
good,"Lowe's have baught RONA a banckrupted company and she is now trying to fill it's vaine with life . "
good,Seasonal work where they hired you with the option to fire you at the end of the time and at any time and it’s hard on tour feet work for minimal wage work
good,"Average place to work. Co workers were very nice. Management could have been better but not bad."
good,Good company to work for great work but Management needs more training when it becomes to treatment and understanding their employees when it comes to medical needs
good,"Could have a better training system but overall not bad. Just like any other retailer, they want to make money. Sometimes consistency is not there in decision making."
good,"It's a standard retail experience so there are always unhappy/agressive customers, weekends/holidays to work, and unfair pay."
good,Really good job just something I don’t plan on doing my whole life. One thing though is stay to your self at this job because everyone will talk about you  behind your back and lie to your face about it.
good,"solving customer as well as employee issues, many home improvement skills to help customers and managing over 150 employees a day, making everyone happy, giving great customer service."
good,In my time working for them I enjoyed it and I learned alot from it but there was little training on where everything was and how to do things and you really had to learn it yourself.
good,"Managers were always helpful to teach and ask what your goals were.  Learned about flooring products and some basic installation techniques.  Hardest part was restocking the ceramic/porcelon isle, very heavy.  and  working till 11pm."
good,"The job was a good job when you had the help and support behind you. Most times you had to do the work of others in order to get the job done. Management never seemed to know what was going on with our department, and frankly didn't seem to care."
good,"Fast paced work place , including but not limited to routing trucks,  answering calls,  researching orders, resetiing deliveries, end of month reports and filing."
good,"lowe's a good place to work.  I worked at lowe's for over eight years. it is a good place to work I worked in Pinevile Louisiana and in"
good,Very lovely people. Felt family oriented. Somethings they need to improve on like hiring people for specific departments that have prior experience to that department .
good,"Being a head cashier there was one of my favorite jobs I have had in my 25 working years, it was fast paced, and I loved the responsibility of being management, but when you get a new and young warehouse manager and he is just a puppet that one of our assistant manager’s controls, and that same assistant manager has A power trip problem and is very particular about workers that kiss his butt,. He has taken other workers that are not management out for lunch, those workers got promoted. If he didn’t like you he would look for any reason to get rid of you. He was a joke, He look and looked of anything he could use to get rid of me, and I unfortunately had been wrong on my days when writing in my hours because I forgot to clock in and the time clock was down another time, and I said I start work at whatever time those days and got them switched, he said I was trying to give myself more hours when one of those days I made it so I lost about 2 hours the day he said I gave myself more time it was 30 minutes. Anyways he got fired eventually from what I had heard, served him right anyways I miss working there otherwise. Just management not just him all management there had issues!!"
good,Working at Lowe's was a great experience I learned to plan ahead of my route also interacting with different customers and also able to help customers with the satisfaction that they are looking for
good,Too much change and management direction not the same for each assistant store manager.  Each has their own agenda and not everyone is spelled out.  Could be much better
good,"Very demanding,no time for breaks,co-workers are great people,walked 15-18 miles a day and never sat down,was a great job until they started going in a different direction,and now they are going in the same direction as Home Depot,part time and no benifits."
good,"A typical day at Lowe's provides challenging work and opportunities to improve problem-solving skills."
good,Temporary job that was relaxed and slow-paced. Staff was provided with training and given a choice of where to work in the store. Management was usually not present in the garden centre. Training could have been improved if it was more job specific. Great job to keep active and enjoy the summer weather. Minimum Salary.
good,It was a part time job. I mostly got the job to gain experience and nothing more. I had to quit because of my schedule. Might be a good job for full time employees.
good,it was pretty alright i got to drive forklifts and sell people lawnmowers workload was very low not really sure upward mobility kind felt to actually get anywhere you to work there for absolute ages
good,"every one was kind to me, but there were times where i feel like i was left out in a lot of things but other than that i was comfortable in what i was doing"
good,It was good fast paced on holidays and sales events. Got along well with everybody and communicated well with all coworkers. Good experience over all.
good,"I began as a part-time employee during the summer leading up to my senior year of college. I initially enjoyed my experience at Lowe's, given that it was/is my first real job, and happily worked for the three months before I had to go back to school. When I went back to school, company policy dictated that I needed to resign, and if I wanted to work there in the future, I would have to reapply. I did so after I graduated, and was re-hired without much of an issue. By this point, the department that I was working in was losing associates, so my work-load increased, as well as my stress levels. I am currently still working here, and thankfully, we are now hiring more people in my department to take some of the stress off of my and my co-workers' shoulders. "
good,If you donut mind working any hours they chose for you this is the place to work. If you are like me and like a set schedule STAY AWAY. the associates are great to work with. Not a fan of the management. to many chiefs not enough Indians.
good,There needs to be changes in management. No more respect for employees high turnover. Management does not follow through on promises. Not enough staff to handle customers. Staff is double and triple worked. Complaints going to HR not being taken care of. Constantly harrassed by new Supervisor no respect for women.
good,"Lowes is was it is, neither good nor bad! I didnt mind working there right out of college but it was nothing special. If retail is your thing than great! if not thats fine too!"
good,It was ok i just did not like the hours i was working. It was a piecful environment.i also had good coworkers surrounding me . the job can be demanding but its great to help people find and get them what they need
good,"I enjoy assisting customers, however it can be overwhelming at times when the department is understaffed. By the time someone comes to assist, the customer has left the department."
good,If you know hardware and have knowledge its a good place to work. Alot of changes are coming to the company but it is best to let the new CEO figure out all his changes before working for the company so the changes dont effect you. That said Lowe's did give me 6 good years of my young adult life.
good,Lowe's changed the description of the job and hours before having enough people to work the shifts and it put a lot more on the people that were there already.
good,"Since I worked as a internet fulfillment clerk, my duties were to fill the online order and notify the customer once the order was ready for pickup.  If their order was to be delivered,  the order was sent to another department"
good,Great place to work for individuals with flexibility in their available to work and who are willing to sacrifice large amount of personal and family time. Holidays and weekends are a requirement to work. The environment is pretty faced paced and require quick learning. Training is a challenge for the organization as a result low there is a high turnover rate for low level employees who is the foundation for the business.
good,"Lowes promotes a Friendly and safe atmosphere "
good,Is a good first job. to get use to customer service. Has a good enviroment & empolyees are always nice and willing to help. Somtimes the hardest  part of the job is dealing with customers.
good,"Opportunity to grow in personal developement skills. Increase in customer facing associates and reduction in operation side, limiting advancement and earning opportunities."
good,"heavy and demanding customer service for this day and age , it is 2019.  "
good,"Most days you go in pretty early 5am or 6am depending on where you work. It's a busy work environment, projects are given to you and you are to complete them in the allotted time. I learned team building as a manager there. Workplace culture is overall good."
good,"People there are nice to work with, everyone has his/her own responsibility to do.  work is never boring, Sometimes we have to step up the plate.  Oveall is fun"
good,"Typical work day at Lowe's is easy going. I would recommend or refer somebody to work at Lowe's. The job can be stressful at times but no often, but the management was great."
good,Great experience working at Lowe’s learned and achieved so much throughout the years been here since high school & here achievement awards & gained great knowledge
good,There seemed to be disconnect between different managers and between managers and employees there oversaw. I have no idea who my managers were when I worked at the Moberly store.
good,Overall Lowe's was a fun place to work. The co workers were very friendly and helpful. Lowe's just needs a better way to store their merchandise and also make sure item numbers are marked on the product when stored in top stock.
good,"I liked working for lowes. As assembly person I built grills, lawn mowers, wheel barells, shelves, fireplaces and displays for the store.I also put together customer items daily as needed."
good,Was always fun to work there. Wasn't a fan of the outside garden area but loved yo work inside. Meet different contractors and people in general. Always something new going on too.
good,lowes was alright and it was ok . It needs better management and better cashiers also. They need to work from the ground up to have better service for their customers
good,"It is a good company to work for, but expect to work hard."
good,Customer service and assisting customers with a new challenge for their home improvement inside or outside is rewarding.Makes me feel completely productive and proud when customer return and ask for me for guidance with a landscaping project or even just matching the shade of paint in their home. Pay at Lowe's is decent and do appreciate the opportunity to be a part of the Lowe's team. Only real issue I have with Lowe's is I need to move closer to my family and transfers within the company are not granted.
good,Opportunities available for growth within the company if you continue to work hard and strive for your goal.  Seek out and partner with mentors throughout the company for guidance and assistance.
good,Lowe’s has restructured its operational staffing model reducing or eliminating department supervisors. Minimal staffing stretches existing resources. Job responsibilities are broad and challenging to complete. This directly impacts job satisfaction. Ability to work on an unforgiving concrete floor is also a necessary adjustment to this work environment. DOS technology is outdated.
good,"The most problems at the store levels is due to the HR managers.  Most of the HR managers I worked with were not trusted in any way by the hourly associates. Chain of command was that for any issues we go to HR before bothering your store or assistant managers. The problem was that the HR managers were unresponsive, and basically swept a lot of issues under the rug."
good,Lowe’s is a good company for customer service. There management is very helpful and training is very good. They work with your school schedule. Very helpful
good,Good work environment. Good workplace to build team and customer related skills. Teamwork is required to succeed. Many positions available most of the year with seasonal openings.
good,"Enjoyed working at Lowes.  Not a lot of opportunity for advancement as company as new CEO, who is instituting many cutbacks. Enjoy working with peers and some local management."
good,I took this job as a way to test my ability to work after a long debilitating illness. I'm not really a fan of retail and feel that opinions of the job would not be helpful to others
good,It's Okay only thing is they cut slot of hours when the sales or Lowe but that's very understand but other then that it's okay good company to work for in the grocery industry
good,My experience working at lowes was an ok one it is a revolving door for employees and management my time there was a good opportunity to learn a more evolved warehouse job skill
good,Every thing goes well unless you didn't have an incident you will be fired right away. The work is very less and they want to cut the costs by any way
good,it was a fun work environment  but communication was a little hectic most of the time they would throw you into a job with no help and you would have to much to do and you would end up having to take a really late lunch
good,I liked the fast paced Work that Was At lowes they were Kind and Good Benefits.I didn't like Was I couldn't get Over 40 Hours. Also liked unloading the trucks and working with the other employees.
good,"When I first started, morale was high and the pay for the workload was evenly balanced. As time went on, my responsibilities grew faster, as well as the expectations placed on me, despite being lower on the workplace ladder rungs. The people there are what really kept me going, and that seems to be the case in a lot of other stores too. You gain a lot of diverse experience from this hob, but it can certainly be overwhelming.  This job certainly is what you make of it, but it doesn't define how much you can enjoy it either."
good,Puts customers before associates most times. Does not allow a lot of time off. They don’t always consider their associates life outside of work. Stressful when busy
good,It was alright. It was a bit hard for me to wrap my head around how the shelves were organized. Trainer was polite and chill to talk to. Only complaint was they fired me before even considering helping me.
good,"The job is team oriented and sales driven. "
good,Lowes is a good place to work at if you just wanna make money not a very good environment if you wanna be happy while making money they don’t except doctors notes and your not aloud to have a life outside of that place .
good,"The people I worked with were great. The management was awful. Good people, but the lack communication and lack of teamwork among the managers themselves was terrible. I was there for 2 years as Customer Service. To me, the stress wasn’t worth the inconsistent schedule, or the lower pay. If you love dealing with people, though, you could work past the issues. Really depends on the person."
good,"Days at work were repetitive, stocking my department and assisting customers. Management made some days difficult but my coworkers were the balancing act. Most enjoyable part of the job was any time where you had to work in a team with other employees. Overall, a relaxed culture when the managers weren't busy looking for everything going wrong."
good,Easy to have a routine. I have learned a lot about flooring products and installation. My manager is always will to jump in and lend a hand. Most enjoyable part is helping people understand how to do their projects and helping them get the right materials.
good,"There was definitely periods of time where the work was above 10 dollars an hour. When they run mulch sales at a competitive price to local places, you are loading mulch for up to 10 hours a day plus normal shift duties into people's cars."
good,At first the place was fun to work then they expect a lot of me. When I got there they're nice and cool and the people started to leave. I think it around the time other store in south city shut down.
good,"Great work environment with lots to be done"
good,Lowe's is a great place to work if you're interested in learning and cross-training in a variety of tasks.  I liked the opportunity to work side by side with employees and learn from them.  This also allowed me to better serve them as I got to know them.
good,"Manager rarely left office. If he did then it was to review departments. He never just walked around to talk to employees. The store was constantly short staffed and he relied on corporate to hire instead of running his own indeed or FB adds. Assistant managers would always task departments, even though I had the. Working on things."
good,"Job was simple. Some heavy lifting needed for the position. 100 plus degree weather in summer and freezing temps in winter. They did not like to give breaks or come out to do overrides. Often got stuck outside with no lunch. Loaders were often short handed so I had to assist loading. Theft was common because I was alone outside with no one to help watch it exit. Phones were often broken so you could not call inside to let people know you needed help, breaks, or security issues"
good,I have worked at Lowes for over 7 years and progressed through the ranks to obtain manager of merchandising. In that time I have Learned more than I could have imagined.
good,Main focus is customer.  Company relies more on diversity than experience and work ethic.  Employees for the most part are like family. Working late was the hardest part of the job.  Having satisfied customers and helping people most enjoyable part.
good,"employees come and go as they please, Employees hide to keep from working. It was a good learning experience and enjoyed employees that wanted to work"
good,lowes is average big box with all of the big box issues. people get hurt regularly look around all you see are knee and arm braces. they hire and drop your hours back to as low as 10 a week but wont let you go or lay you off because they do not wantoot pay unemployment.
good,Working at Lowe's was great. The people are easy going and the job was challenging at times.  You will do fine as long as you do you job. Management was willing to work with you with your hours as long as you have someone to work in your place.
good,"drove tow motor, emptied and stocked trailers, training and safety checks, organizing and assembling orders for pallets. rotating shifts and security checkpoints."
good,"A typical day included arriving, collecting tickets for that days deliveries, unboxing and loading the truck, then going out on the truck to deliver the appliances."
good,get off of my proverbial nuts with this stuff. this is ridiculous. i don't have an opinion on any of my former employers. i don't think i'd leave the perfect job
good,I’ve worked 8 years for Lowes at just about every position. I’ve had amazing experiences as an assistant store manager learning how to build and develop teams and manage business but at the end of the day it is retail. Getting everyone to do their job efficiently is always a challenge. Work schedule is abysmal. Good compensation for retail but not enough to make a living off of. Upper management is always trying to restructure to adapt to modern culture which costs people their jobs
good,indepdant contracter work for lowes very interesting hard to work with because of support from stores sometimes lacking each store is different and you can feel it
good,I delivery furniture and do installs with a contracter I met but its pretty odd right now.just trying to work my way in the door .I just started today 9/24/19 but it doesn't seem like its gonna be that great.seems shady
good,It was an okay job. You couldnt really live off the money they pay you. They have good benefits. Needed better pay. Overall it was an okay job though.
good,"Lowes treated us ok for the most part,I didnt agree with not being able to leave the building on ""my"" break..just because they were paying us for it we couldn't leave,I think sometimes you just need that little bit of separation time from your work environment otherwise it doesnt do you any good"
good,"I don't have anything too remarkable to say about working here. It was another basic job. They pay fair, and have some decent managers, the people that work there are nice enough."
good,It was overall good hours. I received boxes and made sure the product was okay in order for the customer to get there package. It was in some ways really hard due to moving packages high up without machinery
good,It was swell job paid well if I feel like there lacked a lot of communication between the employees and managers. After that there is nothing I have to say about the company
good,"The management is not really good. In my three last months of working in my particular store, saw at least 20 associates leave. Whether they were let go, quit, or transferred to another store. That is a big red flag when a company has a high turnover rate. The actual work is not that bad, I just felt underpaid."
good,"Lowe's Distribution Center in Cheyenne, Wyoming is an okay place to work for a job, but I am personally not invested in it because I don't believe in what they tell me."
good,"Enjoyed working at Lowes , it was a seasonal job which ended in August. Co-workers were great! excellent comaraderie and teamwork. Some Supervisors were lacking in skills such as communicating or replying to your request for scheduling. Overall, I will be back next season in 2020 if a more permanent part time job is not acquired."
good,A typical day involves contacting customers and vendors to ensure projects.  I learned how to manage installations projects.  Management is supportive and helpful.  Workplace culture is has a team player approach. The most difficult part of my job is following up with vendors to ensure jobs are in production.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when customers are satisfied and pleased with our products and services.
good,"Working here was a great experience aside from the management. I would often get asked by customers why young females were helped and not the grown contractors. I feel like this reflected the stores sales as a whole. The employees in the 1006 store, young and old, love to gossip about drama instead of doing their jobs, making it difficult for others to do their jobs. There were multiple instances where I felt that my job was threatened by this, even when I wasn't involved in the drama. If an employee does go to management or HR about issues, they almost never get resolved especially if it has to do with the before mentioned problems."
good,They wanted to train me longer but they did not have enough staff at the time. Everyone was scrambling everyday to help people and most customers left the store because they could not receive any help from staff.
good,Would still be working there if they did not relocate the office to Mooresville NC.  They did offer severance if you chose not to go.  Overall i have been here 10 years and it has not been bad.
good,"Work place was decent , people were friendly. Most days were routine. Management was fair as long as you did your job well. Hardest part of job was customer service"
good,Lowes is a good place to get some retail/sales/management experience but i would not making it your career. Ways to get ahead of others is always be there for the customers.
good,"Every thing nice and slow i learned remodling "
good,"I was trained for a week on the basics, such as the company guidelines and stuff of that nature, then got trained in the department for an entire month or more. It all depends on whether or not your supervisor/manager thinks you're  'red vest ready' that determines how fast you'll get your vest. I was a trainee for a little over a month, which was a bit uncomfortable because all you have is a name tag while everyone else wears vests. They have ""corporate walks' pretty often, and as a result, expect the managers to be on your tail about your tasking before you clock out. They are very serious about it, and sometimes the tasking is a lot and unbearable. Be prepared to be lifting heavy boxes, operating lifts and climbing tall ladders to get stuff from top stock (so if you're afraid of heights, this might be an issue), and zoning products before and after their power hour. All managers/supervisors were different, some were friendly and some were on the authoritative side of leadership. Most of the employees were nice, were happy to answer questions and to lend a hand if needed. Hardest part of the job for me was the overwhelming tasking most times! Also they hate giving overtime. Most enjoyable part is their power hours because those hours are customer focused and you are not allowed to do tasking until after a specific time."
good,great place to start if youre looking for an entry level job especially if youre in school or looking for something while you work on your career or just need a part time job
good,"overall it was okay, there are always many people so not much time for breaks. At first it was overwhelming but you get used to it over time. Wish we had longer paid breaks though."
good,"A typical day at work was walking through the main entrance door. Walking up to the garden department and clocking in the computer . Going to the break room, opening my locker and putting my apron on to head out and start off my day by watering the plants."
good,good place to work nice people good management sometimes hard work but you work with great people the hours are flexible the pay is okay its a start to a good future and career
good,Tips for lowes dont always call out and pay attention to costumers and what they buy espesically if they dont have a respeit and try to walk out the store
good,I recommend that this job is for anyone who need part time and physical demand is necessary. Managers are good if you are lucky. sometimes others will mess up for you but if u don't do anything wrong then you are good
good,"Nice people, fair treatment and decent benefits.  Competitive atmosphere,"
good,Good place to learn things in different areas of renovation and to help DIYers. Learn to work with a group of people as a team and collaborate to finish projects and goals together.
good,"It was a simple job, focused on assisting customers with needs for appliances and/or other building materials. It is simply a job, not a lifelong career."
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work for those familiar with retail, but desiring an atmosphere that isn't entirely retail-oriented. There's always something new to do or learn, and always someone eager to teach you something new."
good,The company has undergone countless changes in the past few years. IT is severely lacking. Constant push to produce results. Direction is going towards constant micromanage.
good,Long days of work.  I learned how fill orders and load them onto tractor trailers. I learned how to receive prduct. Management was readily available to help troubleshoot any problems that would arise. The workplace enviorment was fast paced and very busy. The most enjoyable part of the day was last break.
good,Good first job or retirement job. advancement possible but pay to responsibility ration do not equal up. as movement up stress and emotional toll build.
good,I loved working at lowes. My hard work was recognized and everyone their was kind and helpful. I did my best and they did as well. Their is alot ro di but you never felt rushed or pressured. Great place to work with good enough pay.
good,If you like staying on your feet and constantly changing environment Lowes is a fun place for you.  Learn the whole store and you will succeed as long as you desire to work hard
good,"Good job,  fast paced,  long hours.  "
good,The environment at Lowe's started off good but as management changed it started to be a very stressful job. And managers weren't doing their job and treated us with little respect.
good,"Job tasks are very easy and the environment is pretty relaxed.  Management is kind of out there especially when they’re new.  The Lowe’s I worked at kept getting product they didn’t really need and had to get creative on where to put the extra products.  The co-workers are pretty needy, when they ask for help what they mean is do it for them.  The equipment needed to do the work you had to put on lock and key or it would disappear if you turned around.  Customers were pretty nice even though it wasn’t part of my job to assist them I worked as a stocker not a sales associate.  The only reason I left there is that I couldn’t deal with the allergies any more."
good,When I first started I was excited being I never worked in retail.  That place drained my energy. All the employees did was complain. They had a big problem with theft and for some reason got rid of security. That was a bad call. They was always under staffed.
good,"After all was said and done they just don't pay employees for the amount of work that is expected of them. I enjoyed the customer service, interacting and problem solving on their projects."
good,"A typical day working at Lowes typically involves a lot of hard work. The culture around the workplace is fine, everyone is friendly towards one another for the most part and we often air our grievances about anything be it rude customers or something else to one another. The hardest part of the job for me was the heat, I worked outside all summer long and it was killing me. For the most part, I enjoyed my time at Lowes. The pay was good enough for me to save up enough money for the fall semester at my college."
good,I only worked there for about 3 1/2 months and so I did not get full yearly seasonal experience of being their. I can only say it was an interesting place to see how customers shopped for home and yard necessities. It is basically a warehouse that masquerades as store that caters to peoples lifestyles.
good,"Just like any other company, you really have to work hard to not just get noticed, but to move up. Working hard is also involves working smart. Make working smart part of your job when you're working hard. You will succeed...."
good,"Work with a lot of cool people but you definitely dont get paid enough for the work you do, don't matter what department you're in. Bad with flexibility, worse with scheduling help."
good,Enjoyed the job as a step in my driving career. Was not ever meant to be a permanent job for me. Management changed and I left during that process for disagreements.
good,"Depending on where you are placed for the day, the volume of customers that enter that part of the store would vary. Management is very approachable if you have any problems. Some customers are impatient when they come to pick up their purchases at a later date. it may take some time to locate certain items as it may be placed in a different location or may not even be in the store. Must be willing to work in all weather conditions doing various tasks that most people are unable to do.Heavy lifting may lead towards problems in the future. Great place to start but try to leave as soon as possible."
good,Good part time job but not full time   Company going through too many changes.  Management does not seem to care as much as they should.  Preferences are very obvious.
good,Never missed a paycheck. I meet many great customers and become friends with many customers and coworkers. My job was very diversified with many different challenges on a daily basis.
good,"With the change in CEO, there is no work life balance. If you want to be part time, you still need open availability. (Negating the point of only being part time)."
good,When I first started working there it was a really cool layed back place to work. But now with all the changes being made job security is a problem and people are worried
good,"Politics and dealing with power struggles. Unfortunately, the main focus is not people or customer related. It is simply looking at the bottom line; not how we get there, nor how it effects or can be effected by the employee. "
good,"Unorganized, they have sup's  but the wrk and responsibilities fall on you there was a ""fake it till you make it"" attitude and the dress code is never consistent, ppl go to work and look like they came from the clubs or going to the store no real moral and when they fire you the process is in front of your Co workers with no discretion"
good,There are some great people working at Lowe's Home Improvement. I have found them to be easy to work and collaborate with during my time at the Lowe's South Blvd store
good,"I've been here at Lowe's for 14 years and it is time for a change. The company is heading in a new direction, but it does not seem to care how it gets there."
good,"Taking care of customers is key! Making sure they are informed with updates asap. hardest part of job dealing with irate people. management needs help! most enjoyable part was most of my co-workers, i've worked with many awesome people."
good,Lowe's has made recent changes to improve their profitability at large that makes the company overall look better to investors and customers but it comes at the cost of jobs and salary of current employees and family security.
good,It’s A good job enjoyed working for them the pay was correct nice working environment quick paced job great company worked full time couldn’t ask for a better starting job
good,Great Place to work. Loved it. Worried about job security. Low advancement opportunity. All depends as management. Great as a part time extra money job. Steady hours as full time. Downsizing in recent years.
good,"Each job is different depending on what you do & who you do it for.If you get good strong leadership you cant go wrong if you have decent workers better. In my case,leadership lacked. As for the workers, they're all frustated&hard to work with.All good people just woking under difficult cercomstances."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Lowe's as a company. They offer decent benefits for a retailer, the compensation is reasonable and if they like you they are flexible with certain things."
good,Started days off by ensuring everything in store was safe for customers and employees both. Then do all IRP’s to ensure al product was available to the customer. Downstock all product to make it available to customer. Continue customer service to ensure all customers have everything needed to complete all their projects.
good,"Not a bad place but my biggest concern was being short staffed which led to safety concerns when down stocking items from top shelves, you dither do it yourself or the customer gets impatient and leaves"
good,"No incentive program.  Good people to work with.  Paid by your time, not by what you produce or provide for the company or customers.  Benefits are good."
good,Current mgmt is what ruins this company. It has potential with the right mgmt. Store manager and the few below him are running people out and the store into the ground. My team was great. MST is a different part of the Lowes team but I was in paint before that. Mgmt is my prime complaint.
good,"Pretty good company over all. Some of the business moves that are occurring is hard to understand..................................."
good,Lowe’s as a company was not a bad place to work at! I just had a hard time with being on the front end and being bullied by management. I have no ill feelings towards Lowe’s.
good,Great place to work if you dont have a family or dont need continuity for a schedule. Hours and days worked very week to week with no ability to plan in advance.
good,"The employees were nice, management could step up and give more of an understanding to peoples concerns. There is never a set schedule and I believe what my job title was here should have had that option."
good,"The store had good leadership, and good employees once upon a time. Not so much these days. HR became too lenient with behavior and it destroyed the work ethic of most of the crew."
good,"Good company to work for, offers great benefits. Overall had a great experience working for the company and would recommend anyone to apply for the company."
good,"Was a good internship, just needs more time to develop the internship program. Great taco truck though. Would recommend to those still in college but not to those about to graduate."
good,I love providing customer service every day and learning new aspects of job. As well I love the 401k matching. However I do not like that they do not pay for holiday pay at all.
good,Liked my position. But company eliminated it along with others for outside third party companies. Liked the people I worked with. One of Marvins better ideas.
good,Culture needs more seeding of people in key management positions from disparate places other than from its birthplace if they want to compete seriously with Home Depot.
good,"as with any job it has good days and bad days. currently a company in transition, mostly for the better. installed sales can be fulfilling, we get to make an impactful difference in people's homes"
good,"The managers punish those who work and reward those who don't. They will burn you out and make you hate your position. The people that work there were a massive benefit, good people that cared about one another."
good,"Great place to work, managers were really nice and the team members I worked with easy to get along with. I stocked the shelves so it was a 4am-1pm, Monday-Friday schedule"
good,From the walking pond to the new work out center this campus has everything that you would want to have access to while at work. They even have an onsite sushi bar.
good,"do not work for lowes do not work for lowes "
good,"I was able to learn how to drive forklift get license for it. Also able to input data into the system, make large sales & receive rewards. Nice cook outs, hot lunches & cold ones"
good,"Overall the people make the job, they are some of the best people I have met in my life.  I have developed strong bonds with many of them.  The management teams I have worked with leave much to be desired.  I fell that the personnel scheduling has never been a priority, because they want to obtain their numbers, lapse in department scheduling is the norm."
good,"guaranteed one weekend a month off, a rotation schedule is available to see the whole years worth of scheduled time off. Best to request time off 30 days in advance. Limited shift tradings."
good,not a bad job but to much gossip and weed smokers even though they drug test managers and co workers are nice well some. night shift difficult though always rushing to stock stuff really stresses the manager when morning is coming
good,"New employees or transfer employees could be hired and get to work in about 3 days over 4 weeks ago, now the same process adds 3 weeks. Lowes can't fill open positions due to a new horrible HR system. I tried to transfer from one location to another location and likely will end up working elsewhere because I can't be out of work for too long. The new CEO will honestly put Lowes out of business and into the ground."
good,I wouldn't recommend working there if you wanted to make great money. It is nice to know your home every night but it sometimes is a fast pace so by the time you get home your exhausted
good,"Lowe's as a company is currently going through a change in leadership for the better.  New CEO is instituting many new approaches to selling and customer service that will benefit in the long-term.  However, the transition has not been without its glitches and communication at the store level has been inconsistent, at least at this location.  More emphasis on training of new hires would be a benefit.  That being said, the environment is positive and co-workers treat each other like family, very supportive, and helpful. I enjoy coming to work."
good,"I only worked at Lowe's for about two months during a summer a few years ago, it was fine. Pay was particularly good because I was not only a cashier but also a customer service associate."
good,The store manager would not communicate with lower tier staff. He told other managers about how poorly we were doing. Never good feed back. Our team leader was great though. He took up for us and worked hard. He is the night shift manager and he kept morale pretty high. Assistant managers were horrible. They would scream at employees. There was was only one who didnt. He was a great leader. Really stepped up.
good,This is a good job for any students who need employment during the school year they're flexible with their scheduling and also offer tuition relief if needed.
good,The lowes I worked at in michigan wasnt doing too well so it got stressful some days. Not much was organized wasnt enough staff. Too many budget cuts. I enjoyed working in paint and would work here again just at a different location
good,"-fast paced and very fun environment."
good,"As a cashier, was able to meet many many people. I do great customer service. So was there to answer all sorts of questions. The people realy liked me."
good,Not a bad place to work. Not a normally stressful environment. Enjoyed ability to work at my own pace. Enjoyed interactions with customers and fellow coworkers
good,"Lowes was not a bad company itself, they just need to work on gaining better management. Also if they want the company to succeed they need to hire more people that are determined to put in the work"
good,Most of the employees are down to earth and nice.  Management has their own agenda. I hope the management situation has changed at the Lowes in Bedford Indiana.
good,"Working at Lowe’s is a good experience for customer service, but has a very high turn over rate and it’s hard to move up in the company and get a raise."
good,"The benefits are great. But the hours are brutal, I work at early as 5 am or I stay late as 11 pm. There is a lot of pressure put on employees in order to make sales. For example, the inventory has to have a low or zero bill out. Sales specialists have to generate a high number of sales. Most of all, dealing with the creeps coming into the store. Then you can't defend yourself or protect yourself when they are being inappropriate."
good,"Standard workday."
good,This is an entry level job.  They promised more hours than I'm getting.  Everyone is really nice.  Not really strict.  Wouldn't mind if I had 40 hours or more.
good,"Fast paced job. Talk to the public. Dealing with phone calls. Delivery problems. Management is poor, they continually change managers. No one likes to work and get anything done. Half of staff don’t know what they’re doing or know where stuffs at."
good,Great place to work with the convenience of location and flexibility to work the hours you wish. It is a great place to communicate and build your interpersonal skills.
good,"Lowe's operates just like any other major, publicly owned retailer. The stock price is the only metric of success. In order to improve the bottom line they leverage payroll and require stores to operate at anemic levels. The benefits and compensation, for full time employees, are competitive with other retailers however full time position opening opportunities may be limited. Lowe's is a good place to have a job but a hard place to make a career."
good,"I work at the paint desk and I also help in the front as a cashier. I mix paint, put out freight to restock the shelves, and also color match paint by a piece of something a customer may bring in."
good,"Lowe's doesn't respect their workers ,they work them like dogs ,they make you learn all departments without any trianing and get mad when you say you haven't learned the department yet. and says you have to do it."
good,"It's your typical retail job; low pay, inconsistent hours, the schedualing is all over the place. Majority of hourly staff is students and retired ones. You're not going to earn a living here."
good,"Working at lowes, many people appreciated hard work ethnicity. Working hard with a great attitude characterized made customers feel happy and willingly to shop."
good,It would be a great place to work without the rotating schedule and a little more pay. Some management doesn't belong their as in missy companies. The hiring process is ridiculous
good,This company really trains its employees. Mostly everything you learn is hands on. It's truly amazing the things you can learn. I can honestly say I learned everything about home improvement by working here.
good,"Store manager is great to your face, but treats his managers horribly. Great people to work with overall, but the rotating schedules were a nightmare. You could close one night and then open the next morning. Plan on working every weekend with off days being weekdays only. If you need insurance, don't work here, it will take 1/3 of your paycheck. Great for part timers or students who can only work 20 hrs a week."
good,"Management had pressures from above them which were felt by employees. The district manager was not friendly. It felt very money driven and little care or concern for the employees. The customers were often friendly, but there were some very difficult customers with unrealistic expectations."
good,advancement is pretty much non and void unless they like you. and sometimes that is not true. If you are good at something they will not move you and they will cut your raise so you stay in that spot. Good for retired people or young people just starting out.
good,"Was a decent starter job, they weren't flexible with my school schedule and there was alot of management turnover in my time with the company, not a bad job, but not a great one either."
good,"Started as a temp and got hired on, at first I thought it was a good job but the longer I stayed the worse it got. There are too many managers you have to report to and they often contradict each other. The best part about the job in my experience was some of my coworkers. Like most retail businesses, the customers are for the most part rude. I believe that the pay was not enough for the amount of stress and troubles it causes each day. As far as company advancement goes, there is none."
good,im a delivery driver me and a partner  would delivered and installed appliances from a daily delivery log  i would pick orders and pull orders then deliver and install
good,"Really easy job for anyone with common sense. on your feet constantly, always asking the same questions. Helps to stay in touch with vendors/reps. Communication is everything."
good,The most enjoyable part is getting to know your co-workers. The pay is ok...for a highschool student. To earn liveable wages you need to be at least a department manager.
good,"At first, things went well. Tough/ Hard Work, but it was needed to stock shelves. But you have some supv. that try to dump on you more than what was expected from you. It was an ego thing for him I believe. Other than that I enjoyed it, Good fellow employees I worked with."
good,Lowe's is a rapidly changing company that gets so tied up in what the competition is doing it sometimes forgets about it's employees. CSA's are typically seen as replaceable.
good,"Lots of management turnover, ( resignations and firing) "
good,"Typical day at Lowe’s is you come in and check the appointment book, email, and wire for information about leads, training, and product/department changes. Through out the day you help customers, stock shelves, clean the department."
good,they tet people of right and left..they don't care if you are at fault or not if an accident happens....it's a big place they need more people friendly managers
good,"In my position you have to be a very hard worker. Which I am, that's why I can make it in that position. "
good,Good management decent employees other than a few bad apples it was a very enjoyable place to work with a sense that you were actually apart of a team
good,"Use to be an awesome place to work,slowly going under. Managers are all stressed,so they take it out on you,they lied and said HR, wasn't gone ,that happened maybe 8 months later"
good,"Lowes has a family feel and is a place you almost look forward to walking into. With every company, it has its flaws in management and staffing. But it’s not the worst place to work."
good,Lowes has poor managment that usually will not support the employees when help on the floor is needed. They do offer paid vacation. Management avoids any conflict so issues with another employee will not be resolved.
good,"Co workers are what makes the company fun, some times customers are frustrating because they think you carry a product home depot or menards only has."
good,"At lowe's you need to be on top of your game, just keep in mind that the harder you work the less likely you will get noticed, they think more about themselves than the associates that work there."
good,When I started Lowe's was a good place to work. I liked going to work. As the years went on it became a chore. Management was always changing and rules never stayed the same. I did learn a lot in my ten years here.
good,Lowes is a customer based workplace that requires you to work with the customers on a daily basis.  You need to work hard and learn as much as you can in several departments in order to advance. Lowes prefers candidates with experience.
good,"This place is an averag place to work for/with. A simple job to come into, working to make sure the customer is always right and helping them with any means necessary."
good,"Good seasonal job great pay, alil extra sometimes but it was a very peaceful place to work at especially for spring and summer and discounts were lovely as well"
good,Not all employees at Lowe's have good work ethics and often hide to keep from being 'bothered' by the customers  I worked outside most of the time but would see this often when I went indoors. The managers when I was there were great and helped resolve alot of issues  but once you quit it is very hard to get rehired
good,It's what you would expect from any retail job. Returns and self checkout were the worst as a cashier/front end associate. Customer is alway right even when they wrong
good,Choose not to put my personal opinion on here. Others may enjoy this place. I liked it at first but my views changed due to reasons. Some good managers.
good,"secondary CDL driver is code for extra box truck driver. spent hours on the road. no one gets your orders ready. management is sales focused, despite being in delivery. favoritism is rampant!!"
good,Co workers are friendly and some customers too but it kinda lacks structure and customers always need helo but it is always short staffed. But the pay is good starting at 10 dollars
good,I did not personally enjoy working at Lowe's. Very early starting time and not a lot of employee recognition. Hard to move up because managers play favorites.
good,some of the managers were so so and there are managers that was very helpful.the job was helpful in learning different departments.most enjoyable was helping customers
good,"Back then this was a good company to work for, great benefits and good schedules. The management is good in some stores. I would recommend working here temporary."
good,"Lowe's has a flexible work schedule, works around your life. No real room for advancement, in my experience due to people being there forever. Overall, decent place to work"
good,Stressful. Fast-paced. Collaboration. Must lift materials. Cleaning is a must in your department. Handle customers attentively. Listen to your team players.
good,"Lowe's has been constantly changing and I cant say its been for the best for employees. I love working with the customers for the most part but as said, everyday has its challenges."
good,It’s okay not the best  just make sure you get to work on time and overall it’s a very relaxed enviorment the pay is pretty decent for the work you are doing
good,The employees are fun and caring individuals. They are great at helping one another as well as helping customers. Hardest part of the job is not very good communication between management/ corporate and employees and customer
good,"answer calls redirect to the necessary department"
good,Seemed to be a fair company. There were some downfalls such as there seems to be too much favoritism among management.  Was more a slow paced place to work safety was always key.
good,"Try to apply directly if you can. If you go through a temp agency, you don't get performance bonuses. You would have to work through the temporary contract (3 months typically) and then the warehouse may offer you direct employment. As a temp, you also can't get promotions or even use the onsite nurse (in 2017 at least). If you can get promoted to use a forklift, then you can expect easy money since performance bonuses are easier to get. "
good,Physically demanding. Friendly atmosphere. It a constant changing of employees and managers. Upper management take care of their subordinates. Very big on training.
good,"Loved working at lowes. However, they released all HR effective 7/10/2019 from the stores. No more support other than a 1-800 number. Has become very non connected with the employees."
good,Hourly managment is acceptable. However salary ends up used in very political type bs by senior managment in the company and can be axed at any time despite need a to write a book to discipline there teams.
good,With the store being open from 6 AM until 9/10 PM you can get a very random and spread out work schedule that makes it hard to acclimate or account for a normal life.
good,"Lowe's as a retailer of basic hardware and home goods, is going through a crisis of focus and identity in this new age of on-line and internet driven sales retail sales.."
good,"I achieved many accomplishments at Lowe's but due to some lifestyle changes, the nighttime hours and pay didn't work for me any longer. Loved the people I worked with and hated to resign."
good,Working at lowes was fairly challenging seeing as i did not have much home improvement experiences. I was also not compensated or trained well for these working conditions.
good,"lowe's was a fun company to work for if you didn't know what to do ,you just had to ask someone they would help you . when I worked there it was only a short period of time . I was still looking for a better paying job where I could advance in the company."
good,"Lowe's is a decent place to work, at times stressful but every company will have their ups and down's. The work schedule is flexible plus they worked with me while I was going to school."
good,The job is very stressful. Poor management. Management isn't helpful. Lots of employee turn over leading to people not knowing what they are doing. Poor coaching system.
good,"I usually started my day by getting in the building putting my things in my locker then heading out to the floor to start helping ringing people up, answering phones, calling departments for orders and fronting the store."
good,"High turnover rate,that reduces coverage in some of the major departments.Poor or No Training.Pay scale to low for most. Raises are not performance based. Management restructured three times in four years. Scheduling nightmare for most. ( not flexible ) Better place to work if you are looking for part time work. Way behind on technology."
good,A good place to work but has issues with common place management changes. Has issues with employees calling in and difficulty keeping new employees. But is otherwise a good first or second job.
good,"Family owned grocery store in Texas. A fair place to work, high priced items. Bickering between employees over irrelevant topics for the workplace. A high turnover rate for employees."
good,"People are nice, learning a lot from being there furthering your customer skills. Allows you to interact with many and creates a great work environment"
good,receive nursery products/wait on customers/ load product for customer/ provide plant knowledge/I learned to do special orders on computer/ most management backed you up/worst part of job loading brick and block for customers/most enjoyable was working weather with people who enjoyed gardening
good,"Enjoyed my time there, I had a wonderful supervisor. My hours were consistent and I always knew when I had to be there. It was stressful at times when multitasking at the service desk but employees worked together to make operations smooth."
good,I would say a typical day at lowes would be customer service and walking around straightening up the department. Had okay management at times and the work culture is very boring and could use more fun and exciting. Job is not hard just gets boring from time.
good,"Customer service duties, phone calls, merchandize returns"
good,"Exceptional customer service is me. I have established  good relationship with employees and managers and also with customers. Although, I do not agree with some policies, I comply with the rules."
good,Great place to work for students and people seeking part-time work.  The hours are flexible and the staff is very helpful and pleasant to work with.  It can be stressful at times working with customers.
good,I enjoyed working there. It was a good company I just wanted more set hours during the day. Toward the end of my time at Lowe's I had just had a new baby and wanted to be with him more.
good,only issue with lowes is it was very compettive and too fast paced. other workers would cut you off for product and get in youre way while youre trying to do youre job.
good,its a job if you want to make money then dont complain. busy in the summer if you don't mind. always something to do. depending on who you work with then you could enjoy.
good,"They will run you a lot expecting you to serve a line of customers, help out coworkers, give quality and expert service to customers while making sure that all assigned work is completed. Most times you must work on your own."
good,"The expectations for varying positions has increased to a high degree, while others have remained unaltered. The environment and friendliness is high, however with a great shift of responsibility creates an unbalance in the work space."
good,"We worked long hours with minimal breaks. Warehouses are large so it takes awhile to walk from one end to the other, this is not accounted for in break time. Upper management always seems to be very stressed out."
good,its not that  bad you go in and do the work you have to do. i didnt particularly enjoy it that much but it is a job. the best part is getting the hook ups on some usefull appliances. other than that there is not much to to it.
good,the job is very stressful and you have to deal with people stealing everyday and you have to make sure your paperwork is correct and you did everything right.
good,"In the 18 months I have worked at Lowe's I have learned a lot.  It had been several years since I have handled money or worked with the public so there was definitely a learning curve.  A typical day consisted of greeting customers, handling their transaction and making them feel good about having shopped at Lowe's.  I am fortunate to have great direct managers  but I do not believe top management is taking the employees' best interest in consideration.  Because I love meeting new people that is probably the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced, all over the place, helping customers left and right including disgruntled customers. As long as everyone is doing their job then this place runs smoothly. I learned a lot while employed at Lowe's, a lot of management skills."
good,"The company and the people were great to work with, everybody is helpful. The downside is that the store was often understaffed causing it to be chaotic and makes working there much harder."
good,"The company culture at Lowe’s is suffering quickly. Every day you walked past a huge now hiring sign out front, while having your hours cut by as much is 50%."
good,opening the store a lot was learned about retail. I would of def recommended it under better management. but I would still go back if given the opportunity
good,"Lowe's has its up and has it downs. Lowe's in known for huge layoffs. When you are working, it is a great place to work provided you have good leadership within the group you work and not leadership that on the outside likes to paint a pretty picture and promise the world, but in reality are only out for themselves, they like to pull that trigger to make themselves feel like something they are truly not. Unfortunately you have these people in Lowe's.   In 15 years, I developed great professional relationships internally as well as externally with our vendor partners. I would recommend Lowe's to any person that may be interested. With the new CEO coming from a merchandising background and not from an accounting background, Lowe's will be heading in the right directions."
good,"Just a place to start if ones needs to get back on their feet. not easy to move up . needs better pay so employees could stay longer, turn over rate not as good as it should be"
good,"Lowes isn't in its self a bad place. I had bad management that gave me poor raises for years. I understand that this is a customer based job, but at some point, you need to have your employees back and not blame them for everything thing."
good,"Everyday was pretty much the same where I would go in and either restock, sell, or move around products. I learned about flooring and appliances. The culture of Lowe's was kind of weird but overall it was pretty good."
good,Horrible management  but I love what I did.work days was out of control but the pay was great.some of the people there are very good people just terrible management
good,it is retail so the pay is not great and depending on your department the hours could suck hard to get promoted or even transfer to another department they would rather hire someone of the street rather than someone who already works there. Some of the managers are ok some not so much most customers are nice but occasionally you run into one that could ruin your day
good,It just wasn’t the job for me. The customers were very rude even though I was there to water plants I feel like they could of gave me a opportunity to learn and to be trained on new things.
good,"Lowe's has been through a lot of changes over the years and hopefully the new CEO will make it to where employees pay , schedules,  and benefits will create a better life for the employees and their families."
good,Sometimes demanding. Varies greatly from store to store.  General way that the company is run is very illogical at times but you will never be asked to do anything difficult
good,Good place to work as a temporary job. I worked there in my early 20's. Good people to work with. Nice to be able to work in and outdoors. Discounts are helpful too.
good,I was hired only on a seasonal basis and was let go after the contract ended.  Summer season was hectic and as August approached the busy season was pretty much over so I was let go.
good,"Usually the store would only barley have enough employees in a at a time to have one working two departments each, daily complaints from customers that there is no one that can help. Managers are mostly lazy and put everything on one or two of the good managers."
good,I have good days and bad like any other job but the store management changes to often to be reliable. Most workers are helpful and friendly but some were there just for a check
good,Not enough employees. Cutting hrs and not enough help. They expect too much from their employees. And not enough time to accomplish any tasks during the day
good,"its an okay place to work, pretty laid back and decent people. a lot of gossip however, and the females try to fall in love with any male worker out there, so if that's your thing youre probably in luck."
good,"Working at Lowe's isn't bad. There's no toxic environment, and the customers are more respectful than most retail chains. It really boils down to which department you end up working in, and who your manager is."
good,put up all product that came in on 1st shift and then pick out product that was due to go out the next working day. Restock any product that sold threw out the working day
good,Was over worked an didnt get the pay of my check like i should have worked in many departments but never got a check over 3 hunred out of a 2 weeks pay with what my pay rate was.
good,"How well you enjoy working at Lowe's is dependent on how accountable the management at that store holds its employees. A typical day can be spent fixing problems that other employees caused or ignored without any repercussions from management. The processes for a smooth operation are in place, but a lack of training leads people to be the cause of these processes to fail."
good,Fast pace work environment yet associates and management are always eager to help and allow time for learning.  The most rewarding part of the job is serving customer needs.
good,"It’s a nice place to work, management is okay, really nice coworkers. The hours is the biggest downfall. Pretty good benefits. Can’t make a living on the hours though."
good,"Busy work place and most associates are easy to get along with. Meet new customers daily along with a few regular faces. A lot to do during work shift such as zone recovery, stocking and pulling orders."
good,Retail position that comes with the expected consumer base. Staffing was poor. Not enough staff to assist customers lead to a stressful working environment.
good,"They paid well compared to minimum wage, but not enough to easily live in the area I worked.  Employees and managers were generally really nice and working there was overall pleasurable (for large retail work).  Health benefits for part-time and full-time workers is great.  Also, being dog-friendly is HUGE and great for both customers and employees alike.  "
good,"Great benefits, medical-dental-vision, ok benefits as far as time off, sick days paid but some managers scrutinize to the maximum limit if you take sick day off. Favoritism with managers"
good,"The staff was friendly for the most part. A nice place to work at. I did not like working over nights anymore, and I had a hard time fitting in with the rest of the night crew."
good,"Typical retail. My day started early to scan for outs and create order sheets for dept. managers. then download and implement price changes. Lots of customer service. Making signs, cleaning ect..."
good,I enjoyed my time working for Lowes.  I loved working with people and the opportunity for advancement.  The only drawback to working in this retail environment was the unpredictable schedule.
good,"Fast paced work, have to be able to handle customers without letting some get to you it can be stressful. Management can be rude at times. Have to multi task daily."
good,Cared about the workers until new management now just seems like quotas have to be made. Otherwise good job for people that need flexible hours just little room for advancement.
good,"Managers at my location would keep certain employees, including me, in a position where they wanted them to stay. So if an employee wanted to advance in a different role in the company rejection was placed upon them to keep them in their current role. Also when problems abrupt management tends to handle it poorly."
good,"Constant changing as far as management roles, etc. Good atmosphere as far as employees go. Management is willing to learn their roles. Lack of training for certain positions based on turnover. Discounts are a plus and they are great for veterans working."
good,Good company to work for.  Work is hard and long hours but the pay is good.  Need to be available at all times on the day and sometimes on call.  Working as a team is a must.
good,"good enough to get you by."
good,"it is a decent place to work depending on how you have for managers and how they are, ive had bad experiences with department managers and also had customer complaints about the customer service i the stores being poor and not having anyone ask them if they need help"
good,The store was a good place to work but you did have some members of management who looked down at you. I experienced the difference between me and other  employees when it came to raises and rewards it seems to be all about the color of the skiiin
good,amazing company it involves a lot around safety. customer service is great and although there was changes def a company who wants to see people grow and become professionals .
good,"Learned various floor laying techniques as well as traveled multiple locations to install tile, carpet, and hardwood. Convenient customer service was also provided."
good,This job was great I had alot of fun. I was allowed a flexible schedule. I really liked my managers. There were very supportive of my work goals and life.
good,If you don't mind wearhouse work then this place is good to work for great HR and management good pay just mind numbing repetitious work great company though just long hours
good,"Male ego/power in management roles. Good jobs and learning experience with all jobs, fast paced most of the time. No HR in building. Good medical/dental/vision benefits."
good,"It was an okay place for me. They had some nice workers there and the managers weren’t that bad. I’d have preferred morning shifts only and more pay, but it was okay."
good,"Good benefits. Made friends for life. Lots of favoritism. Not a terrible company to work for... Just don't get stuck there. Work/life balance? Ha, good luck. Overall though great pay, some good people. But Lowe's is stuck in the past with everything. Good luck!! :)"
good,"I worked from 5:30AM-2:30PM Monday- Friday and some weekends. your early morning is all counting money and organizing business reports. After that I was expected to assist customer service, process audits, and answer phones. This job requires decent cash handling skills, and are expected to be coverage for any department when needed."
good,High turnover; not enough help! Wonderful coworkers make it pleasant; not a bad job if there were enough workers to share the workload; managers are generally very fair
good,It started out as a great place to work schedule was beautiful! The managers ultimately fails us. The benefits was not all that great and the place never had set rules and regulations and things changed almost every week and it still never gotten better.
good,This was not the job for me. I'm sure i could still be working there now but i wasn't thrilled with having to sit behind a computer all day. Very good job and plenty of room for advancement if its for you.
good,"I like the job but the management is horrible,  lack of respect and not very knowledgeable.  Use to be a great place to work but the management team is horrible. Lead by example is an understatement"
good,just find the right store and you will be ok. its a hard ware store so dont expect to be doing anything exciting. perfect job if youre still in school
good,Not really my cup of tea. Not a fan of retail. Was hired with the understanding I would be primarily doing commercial delivery. That wasn't the case. I ended up going on a lot of appliance deliveries.
good,"Lowes was generally a good place to work, although the hours were a bit to be desired. Many hours were not good, especially since driving a long way to get there."
good,one store was a good place to work with due to a great store management.  had a family back ground feeling and the store manager took care of his employees
good,New executive management came in thus a change in the work force was bound to happen along with the environment. Overall I am grateful to Lowes for my tenure there.
good,"Must be fit and willing to operate heavy equipment. The politic is heavy and managers takes their time to get with you. It is a cooperate company therefore, changes are slow and sometime none."
good,Must be very attentive to details in this position. Requires long periods of being on your feet on a concrete floor. Must enjoy working with the public.
good,as lowes being a big retail business it could use room for improvement. but like every company they always try to cut cost and that means cutting employees to the min. leaving them to work harder for less pay.
good,learned to work as a team and how to properly lift heavy objects into homes safely.hardest part of the job is lifting the objects into tight and small places.
good,"Pay was over minimum wage. Loved being outside working with the plants and flowers. Friendly co workers. Pay was decent for a part time job. Worked hard, physical labor"
good,This company was a nice place to work in spite of the management. The associates that I worked with and the customer base that came in made the job most tolerable.
good,"I really dont have an opinion, i enjoyed working at Lowes, it provided a steady income and reasonable hours. I love working with the public so working there gave me a chance to improve my customer service skills."
good,"Sales culture is reverting to the same as the major competitor.  The senior management are extremely overworked and highly stressed.  It is apparent that the stress comes from the top and is trickling down to the staff.  Though goals are made for a long term plan, the results are expected to be instant.  The staff you work with is excellent and very knowledgeable if allowed enough time to be trained."
good,Was a nice place to work although they had many managers and you wondered who would be next and from where; did they have people skills to relate to customers
good,"I'd never thought I'd walk out on a job, but I decided to do so with this one. While the pay and hours were great, the stress and mental toll was not. "
good,"Good Company, Great benefits employee discount. Advancement to move up in the company. Employees not friendly towards each other. Good Management. Many changes to the company"
good,"Weekends are a must "
good,Lowe’s was okay at first but they changed from having management do the schedule to letting a computer do it and now your not even guaranteed 10 hours A WEEK.
good,"Often management will take advantage of workers who are productive trying to get whatever they can squeeze out of them. They tend to put too much on productive workers instead of addressing workers who do not complete their tasks and roles. After working their three years my responsibilities and tasks have continued to grow outside of job description, while increased benefit has not followed. That said, it provides a stable job with good health and dental benefits, alongside other benefits such as discounted return appliances, usually significantly lower than sale price. It is also great whenever you are able to assist genuine customers and help them solve the problems they come in with."
good,"I just started at lowes and so far so good but i am looking for something full time.The people are great, but overall it is a very slow paced enviroment with not much to do."
good,"It is a great company, but management is to be desired and can use a lot of improvement. The turn over rate is high and that's possibly due to the lack of training provided."
good,"always work to do, stocking all merchandise, moving or relocating merchandise using forklifts or hand trucks cherry pickers electric hand trucks helping customers with their needs"
good,"There is not much i remember other than the management always seemed to be angry and annoyed and had a habit of taking it out on the employees, but that was over 10 years ago, most of those people are dead or gone."
good,Lowes' is on its way from good great! Leadership must recognized their unconscious biases and actively work at becoming better leaders. Manage your personal feelings about others and spend time getting to know people that makes you feel uncomfortable. Lowes cant be great until leaders recognize that diversity is power and must feel natural leading it.
good,"Always Dow stock and cleaned the beams."
good,The MSA position is changing.  Less building and troubleshooting.  More downstocking/fronting & facing.  The benefits are very good.  Workplace culture is fairly relaxed at the location I worked.
good,A typical day at Lowe's includes customer service and stock work. The workplace culture is to always focus on the customer and how the company can help the customer love where they live.
good,"Working for any home improvement company has it's challenges but being able to help people change their living spaces is amazing!"
good,Unfortunately there is a high turn around at Lowe's and I believe it's in due to a large part to the random scheduling and lack of communication between departments and at times even managers. The people are great to work with. but there is a lot that needs to change with management and even the CEO has made some poor decisions in my opinion.
good,"When I started I was hired as seasonal/ part-time. After my second year I was promoted to a full-time Outside Lawn & Garden associate. Then in my fourth year Lowe's started getting rid of all full-time positions lower than Sales Specialist and I got moved to Receiving/ Stocking Associate. Then they got rid of that position as well and I got moved to the Lumber department. I don't think that my store wanted me gone as an employee, but Lowe's was restructuring their employment infrastructure at the store level and I needed to go. I don't harbor resentment against Lowe's and would suggest them to someone looking for entry-level customer service."
good,"I have worked for Lowe’s for quite some time. I used to enjoy working there but now it’s so many changes, I worry if I will have my job the next day. They are slowly turning into Home Depot."
good,A typical day at work was always challenging and very rewarding. I enjoyed my job and all of the different people that I worked with. I enjoyed putting projects together for the customer and making sure that all of the installations ran smoothly.
good,"During my experience my manager played heavily on favorites and used condescending tones when speaking to me and other staff members. In addition she told upper management I had an attitude resulting in a no re-hire attempt when I tried to recant my 2 week notice, after reconsidering my decision. I consider this to be very manipulative and detrimental to my character because it was un-true."
good,Advacment is always available hours suck and no benefits are offered what so ever managed very poorly by general store manager disrespectful and unprofessional
good,This job allowed for short 4 day work weeks which allowed for more personal time at the expense of a smaller paycheck. The job itself is fast paced and easy to learn.
good,"Job was ok. It was a little further out on my commute than i originally thought. company was ok to work for, but didn't meet my expectations. thought customer service would have been better."
good,"Your experience will vary depending on who you work for, and who you work with.  There are many inconsistencies that will either work for you, or against you, depending on the situation."
good,"Worked alone at self checkout, abused by cusotmers daily. Very little mamager support. Forgotten breaks by supervisors. stressful work environment. ..."
good,It was a great job I worked there for years.  I liked the diversity and all the different areas I was able to excel.  Really fun environment and great people.
good,"Able to get a lot of work done, but management is always on us about getting little things done that are not as important as taking care of customers."
good,very fast paced if you want to go home sometime today because every delivery has to be made.Somedays you could get out semi early and the next it would 6 or 7 and you started AT 6 IN THE MORNING.
good,"Productive and great atomsphere to work in. My typical day at work is fun and enjoyable. Working for that company and interacting with so many different people, you learn a lot."
good,Unloading trucks and stocking product on shelves. Management wants work done in a timely fashion. Warehouse setting concrete floors not very noisy. Hardest part was unloading the trucks.
good,Job benefits are good.management and training needs a little more work. Lowes has some amazing team members to work with to get the job done.It is a standard job.
good,Lowes is a great place to work if seeking temporary work. I have enjoyed working at Lowes mainly for its flexibility in hour and for the great customer service we provide.
good,Management here isn't the best. the pay isn't worth the job and we were constantly under staffed and they did not want to pay. Not very team oriented.
good,"I worked at Lowe's for about a year and a half and saw 2 managers leave for better opportunities, 1's position get phased out, and right before I left they began doing an entire management overhaul. Though management is good, it is constantly changing and to top it off it is not at all a priority that they understand floor positions. You have to figure out who you can ask what because some of them are really useless. Meanwhile, I also saw three of my coworkers jobs just get the chopping block and be forced to find something else. They overwork you and underpay you for the work they ask of only their favorite employees, and now HR isn't in stores so it doesn't feel like you have anybody in your corner. ""Moving up from within"" to actually meaningful position takes years unless you're lucky as well. You gain a lot of experience and strength over time, but there is a terrible work to life balance and it is encouraged. Higher ups in corporate also send out new protocols without a clue of how business is like in stores. Overall, I wouldn't recommend."
good,"Lack of Knowledge with management, but it doesn't affect myself as "
good,"This is a very phsyical job.  You have to be able to stack heavy, odd shaped boxes quickly.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and management was good."
good,Lowe's was a on place to work at. Sometimes you have you fast pace days like on the weekends. Weekdays are usually slow paced. The employees were fairly friendly.
good,Good company. Good benefits. Typical day consists of interacting with customers and stacking shelves. Hardest part of the job was working overnight hours.
good,Decent job that I had. decent coworkers and fair management. Simple work. Not a bad place to work overall. Everyone looks out for eachother and is on the same team.
good,The Project Specialist Interiors position was one of the more challenging jobs in the company but along with its challenges it also provided great satisfaction when a completed renovation project brought happiness to clients.
good,I personally think  that lowes pay people descent money    but the one I work at needs a little work when it comes to employees and being consistent of  giving their employees the hours and the right amount of pay they need to make a living.
good,"As a seasonal employee you will work hard for Lowes and be let go around the middle of September.  They will give you a date in advance.  No raises, focus is on making the customer happy."
good,"They treat full-time like part-time and benefits are only for full-time. In the summer they give you 40, but the rest of the year they send people home."
good,a slow paced yet productive work setting . Could be a little more organized. From my personal experience I would not work for them again but overall it was a pretty decent experience.
good,Work is typical 8 hrs per day. No more then 39 hours per week. challenging at times and hard work. Customer focused. Can learn a lot and expend knowledge.
good,"It was just a temporary job, nothing special. Although, I didn't feel like I was making good use of my time while working there because I wasn't learning any new skills. Management was okay but the work environment was stale and often slow. It was just a job to pay my minimal bills."
good,Amazing place to work for. Fun people and the environment is absolutely great. You will learn a lot in this kind of environment. Join there and you will enjoy.
good,It's hard to answer any questions related to my experience with Lowe's.  Under the new CEO my position and several others were completely eliminated from the company and I forsee the restructuring and store closing to continue
good,Dont work here they will slowly weed out the old and experience help and fill younger lower pay positions you come to work everyday not knowing you will have a job
good,I worked as a department manager where the Assistant Manager would bark out order and walk away with his cell phone stuck in his ear. Never have I worked with a loser like him. After I left the employment with Lowe's I heard they fired him. This was the best for Lowe's because he didn't earn his pay check. I would work for this company again with his dismissal.
good,Coworkers were great.always helped out if ever needed help with anything. Some managers were great and helped out others just watched and told you what to do
good,"Not a terrible company and a lot of opportunity for advancement.  However, the talk of work/life balance is only talk.  Management is salaried and is supposed to be 48 hours a week but is scheduled as 50 by many store managers and realistically ends up as 55-60.  Shifts vary and they have just eliminated the rotational schedule so there is no planning a schedule or vacation as easily any more.  They’ve also been eliminating a lot of salaried and hourly positions of late and it’s hurt a lot of good people and good workers who have been squeezed out."
good,"Pretty good job, job was not that bad, I just did not like working every single weekend. Hours did not work good for me, but the pay was good and the people were good."
good,Yo have to be a fast paced person to keep up with all the changes threw out the store . My most enjoyable part is every day regular customers. The hardest part is no set hours all different hours and days. Culture is great different people to with work. The hardest part of job is when you have customers that you do everything you can to help and they still don't get help. It is rewarding to help people meet their goals of loving where they live.
good,"lots of things to learn and gain experience. but too much physical work. "
good,"It has been a while since I have worked for Lowe's, but I worked for a total of 11 years. At the time the company was customer focused with less regard to employee concerns, but that changes with management turnover. I enjoyed the environment, coworkers and customers."
good,"when i started it was a great job, awesome team members, fun environment, understanding management. The old GM got fired, and it really plunged downwards. management came in and changed all the rules, breathed down your back about everyhting every day, not knowing what it takes and instructing you to do things that cant physically be done. they had no idea what it took to run that place like we did, alot of other employees just walked off."
good,"Lowe's was a great place to work with a great culture when I accepted the ASM role in Opelika Alabama. Great people, great atmosphere, and great customers. That all changed when I transferred to San Antonio Texas where the culture did not promote inclusion, diversity, nor expression of ideas and suggestions. There was no direction, there was no support from the store manager as far as mentorship, and there was no indication that I was welcome at this location (store #1579). In short, I committed career suicide by relocating to San Antonio from Opelika Alabama."
good,"It was an enjoyable place to be. I enjoyed assisting our community with their projects. It was nice having customers come in and tell you how nice an idea that you gave them turn out. It was a family, not just my co-workers."
good,"It was the beginning of learning in a hardware retail store.  It wasn’t very productive, challenging, constructive as I would have liked it. It didn’t have much business as my other jobs."
good,this is a good company to work for. As a retired person this position allowed me to work the hours I wanted. The company offered more perks for people that wanted a full time position.
good,This job was frustrating delivering appliances and other products to customers using a box truck and flatbed cdl truck with moffet.Management was fair
good,"Lowes is a good company to work part time for but please don't make it your career. The scheduling is awful, and they don't delegate tasks very fair. Most managers are fair but they do have a few that can rub you the wrong way. Don't work full time here, but it is great for going to school or just to fill in some extra time with something."
good,"the lack of staff in Lowes was slim to none. most of the time I would work alone in my department with a rare occurrence of seeing my other co workers. my job was also too do everyone else's job as in operate forklift, order picker and reach. we had to also help out in others peoples department."
good,"Store manager started a new love  life with a partner who is 24 years younger and this person is spending all of her money, so she started taking her bad days out on employees that maker her store run. Not a good manger when the floor employees know she was told this is her last store. If she starts drowning this location, she will be done. Store 3033 Petal, MS"
good,"In 1980, Lowe's was a small company with approx. 80 stores. I was there to be a part of a growing multi-billion dollar business with over 1200 stores when I left in 2012. Benefits and stock options were huge draws for anyone wishing to have a CAREER … in recent years, this has truly diminished.  Job cuts and deterioration of benefits have made Lowe's a ""not so good"" place to work now. Sad to see what was once one of the top 100 places to work in America become a ""not so good"" place to work."
good,"Many changes have taken place due to the new ceo’s Plan. Jobs were secure for years, now it’s a dice roll on what positions will remain within the new structure. Great job to learn customer service."
good,Its a ok company just depend on the managers and the people that you are working with. Everyday its kind of a new challenge BUT doing the same thing lol..
good,Like any big company it has its ups and downs. We with them for 13 yers moved locations then came back and could not find me a spot cuz of how much I made
good,"Typical retail environment and usually enjoyable place to work, but the many changes with the new CEO have been stressful.  Hours are being cut and employees are stretched too thin."
good,not bad just how it was at the location I was in I had fun with the co workers I was with and some managers know what they where doing the rest not so much but I did learn a few things
good,"When I first started working at lowes it was pretty fun and exciting. I caught on pretty fast, and amazed my employees. Bring the youngest one working there I working with all age groups was pretty fun."
good,If you like to work more than your fair share then Lowe's is a good place to work. Management plays favorites. Don't ask to leave early or come in late to pick up or take your to school.
good,"Lowe's was a great company to work for. The bottleneck they created when they eliminated Department Managers, as far as career advancement, was a demoralizing move. They used to hire from within the company very regularly but took away one of the stepping stone positions to get into the higher levels of the company. A lot of the changes they do always seemed to make things unnecessarily difficult on their associates in the stores."
good,Customer service handling returns checking out people making sure all cashiers had what they mean making sure all the returns went in the white bucket for the associates to put away Angeline orders online
good,"nice place to work but needs to improve on a few things. There is long work days, not a lot of breaks, the work culture is ok and the hardest part of the job is staffing."
good,This is my first job as a cashier. I have enjoyed learning the experience of working in this field. Meeting new people as well as the customers to encourage them to make their purchases here and they will be honored.
good,"Working at lowes gave me more than I could imagine. I was able to learn a lot from them, they gave me a lot of great training I needed and I'm grateful. I love the people I work with they make it durable when the customer gets little out of hand. Everyday is something new and learn something different its not all the same. It's a great company, the only thing is now that I want more, I want something different and more money."
good,The only thing i dislike about working at Lowe's was the late hours i had to work and it was a temp job. overall I'll go back to Lowe's and work my butt off
good,i didn't really enjoy all the changed happening every week with new managers and there was some favoritism which i found very annoying and i felt picked on my some of my old mangers.
good,My shifts varied from starting at 6 am to ending at 10 pm. The work was sometimes interesting but the training I received did not really relate to the actual work I was doing. More hands-on training relevant to the job would have been preferable.
good,"great place to work,i enjoyed working there.HR could use more work,they tin to be on the side of management,because hr gets to close to management.good bonus plan"
good,"Teaching product knowledge to customers, who needed help with their home improvements jobs, Making sure they had the right information to make the right choice."
good,"learned a lot about sales and products that were most popular"
good,"Typical corporate politics, micro managed constantly. Tell you metrics don't matter, take care of the customer, then write you up because your metrics aren't where they need to be. That being said, the pay is great for the requirements, so if you can put up with being treated like a child as an adult, this is the place for you!"
good,Lowe's  is a home improvement/hardware store. It is a very fast paced and competitive environment. Lowe's is currently undergoing massive restructuring in order to compete with it's number one competitor.
good,At Lowe's  I met and worked with a wide variety of  people from all over the world. It was a pleasure working alongside them. It is unfortunate the the company does not respect its employees enough to pay them a fair wage.
good,Lowes is becoming a corporation that focuses solely on share holders and less and less on the very people that had made the company so great. There was a time when if one worked hard and gave their all Lowe's would encourage those employees to advance their career within Lowe's. those days are now gone. Each year there are less and less valued employees to cover the busy seasons.
good,The only thing I had a problem with was the management team and the way they ran the place. Some managers had their favorite associate that would get treated better than any other associates.
good,"regular day at lowes helping customers, putting away stock, cleaning, no real direction given at the beginning by managers, a lot of micromanaging between managers."
good,The manager is cool but one of the assistant managers is a total which  it is a relaxed environment would totally recommend working for the company  friendly coworkers except for the  One assistant manager
good,Typical day at work was managing employee  handling customers needs learned about management working with the people  enjoyment of the people you working with.
good,It a good company to work for there is a corporate management change going on but change is slow down to store level . there is still a great bunch of original employees working there that have a desire to to grow.
good,There was alot of favoritism in this company.  Made it hard to do your job.  Very stressful and fast paced job. Don't have alot of positive things to say about this job.  It just wasn't the job for me.
good,By the position being part-time theirs really not a whole lot to say reason being is you really don't get full effect of the position. Considering your time actually at the job.
good,Poor communication from the top down. My schedule changed from what I was told it would be. Work load is not equally distributed. Tasks are assigned with an impossible timeline.
good,"Often times one has to ask themselves, is this all I am good for? If you are working for Lowe's the answer is no. Lowe's recent development has not only created an unstable work environment but also a lack of job security. They are creating new positions but also getting rid of the old position. This cut-throat tactic is used to expend less hours, while maximizing profit. On the small scale they make it seem like they care for each individual but in reality they themselves know it is survival of the fittest. If you plan on advancing in this job culture don't be afraid to loose your position because they decided to get rid of it. This is what Lowe's is all about."
good,I had a good team to unload and restock all of the merchandise for the company. The managers were really strict on stuff that we had to do and the time that we had to do it in and most of them were unrealistic
good,"The job itself was your typical home improvement type job, interacting with customers.  The hours of work were all over the place which i didn't like so much."
good,its a job not a career the hours for a full time associate do not leave much time for a life outside of work the. pay is fair but not exceptional and the raises are not great at all
good,"As a Lowes employee I felt like I wasn't going anywhere, I mean this literally and figuratively. Every day had the same pressure but never ever felt like I was gaining anything that I could go home and feel proud of."
good,"Was a good place to work, until they let everyone go. There's not much else that can be said about it.  "
good,"Excepted to do more of a work load than what they want to pay you for, fun enviroment, no incentives, I learned alot about what it takes to upkeep a house etc"
good,The pay is good and it is over all an easy job. But you are just a number on a page to Lowe's. Don't expect to receive any empathy from any management.
good,"you come in and do the tasks and help customers around you. It can be challenging and very rewarding.  If you put the effort in, they will give you more work."
good,Lowes is a typical big store with lack of floor organization and employees running from customers.  Product shelf placement and restocking is a disaster.
good,My typical work day was to take materials off a conveyor belt and put them onto pallets. My team and I had to use pallet jacks and dollies to take the materials to their assigned department of the store.
good,help costumer locate products. Help them learn how to use them. Answered all question about what they needed /wanted to know. Answer phones. help get orders ready.
good,great staff  an fun place to work only two issues i had were lack of saport an lack of willing to give 80 hours a week for full times employies. staff is willing to help all over the store.
good,Daily stocking and facing of material on shelving was very boring.  Dealing with customers was interesting and ability to help them was sometimes difficult as to gaining information about what they were exactly looking for.  Could be a very long day when there was no work to be done or no customers and the store was already cleaned and stocked.
good,in a typical day you would have lots to do it also gave me a chance to learn how to operate a forklift properly and safely the experience it gave me was overall a demanding job
good,Clock in to start your work day.  Provide great customer's service as well as complete designated tasks as well as get your job done.  Cover neighboring departments when more help is needed to provide customer service.
good,"I understand doing more with less, however Lowe's takes this to the extreme. Management at the two stores that I have worked at do not seem to play favorites and did not give chances to move up. Even though I have a Bachelor's degree and almost 5 years of management experience."
good,"great management, lazy co-workers. this is a retirement job for a lot of them. technology is from the 50's ( no really everything is DOS.) most of the customers are dumb, raciest, and entitled. oh. and if you aren't sick of hearing old folk complain about ""millennials"", you will be. ( they think it means anyone under 30)"
good,"Depending on the position you have, it might be difficult to move upward or even laterally. Especially if you are working in an area that is short on valuable employees."
good,"You get out of the job what you put into it. I've meet people with positive attitudes and others not so positive. There are many opportunities here, it just depends on what you're looking for."
good,"There are days you will feel overworked especially during holiday sales, and there are days that you are struggling to find work to do.  Overall it is a decent job."
good,I love the job sometimes and the other times I don’t  I love the coworkers and all the friends I’ve made over the  year and half I’ve been there it like another family
good,Were always short handed. Some good managers and supervisor's. Not always recognized for work you provided. Were expected to pick up other employees slack.
good,The place is great to work at for a okay amount of pay but the training is very light and they seemingly expect you to have a decent knowledge of the store and the type of stuff in the store.
good,Typical day at Lowe's is full with new stuff to learn.The customers are my favorite part of at working at lowe's. Learning new every day. Nothing is hard if you just put your mind an hard working skills into it.The management cares an puts the time an effot in helping you. Learning to move forward.
good,"I worked out in a shed in the yard and it got really hot. Mangament was kind of a mess. I like the other workers that i worked closely with. I can now put together many times of grills without looking at the manual, and in record time too."
good,"A great place to start in the working world I started fresh out of high school. It wasn’t bad for a single person living at home, but to support a family would become difficult with out being a manager"
good,"stressful place to work. People are not valued as individuals, just another body to work without complaining, and getting low pay as well. You are not valued as a person, and YOUR OPINION DOES NOT MATTER."
good,"decent job just doesnt pay much, would have stayed if they paid more and offered more vacation and better benefits. nice people and cool management. would recommend."
good,"This is the bottom rung of the ladder.  Definitely entry level, but still had opportunities for advancement.  If you're all about the night shift, you pretty much can make a decent living here.  Go for all the training provided to make yourself as valuable as possible, so you're qualified for upcoming opportunities."
good,Didn’t like the inconsistent work schedule . During some months they schedule people weeks off and cut hours often . An hour off the clock lunch break .
good,great company overall. They care for there employees. benefits are great. Work enviroment is fundamental and great. Incentives for empoyees are great as well
good,The other employees there made the work place a non stressful and easy going environment to work in. The management was rarely ever seen unless there was a problem. Fairly easy to find something to do to keep busy.
good,"Very easy and relaxed place to work at, hours were very flexible. Staff was very friendly and always willing to assist in training new employees. This is a great place for someone to work at if going to school full time."
good,"A typical day at work included reviewing plant-o-grams, setting product in required locations, unloading product, plant care including watering and pruning, organizing, and customer service. What I have learned in merchandising is how to read plant-o-grams, learned the variety of plants and how to properly care for plants. Management needs more staff. The hardest part of the job was working with harsh weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the plants and assisting customers."
good,As the Assembly manager my hours were set after the first year or so. But only a couple of other people had set hours like that. To much complaining going on manager was bad
good,"It was a pleasure to care for all areas of the Lawn & Garden Dept. and perform assistance to the store management and , especially, the many daily customers."
good,"Overall, a decent place to work. The only issue that I had was with the amount of work they expected from one individual. Their expectations were too high for one person."
good,Job wise its a really relaxed environment but the relationships between staff and management is too casual. Timely management is too loose and no authority on absences and missed days. No according punishment is taken.
good,I feel comfortable walking into work and comfortable doing all of my job asks of me. My manager is very professional and provides me with all the resources I need.
good,"Their hours are all over the place, no set schedule, managers change and so does your role. You go where you are  needed and you do what you are told."
good,"I worked at a store in the Hampton Roads, Virginia. It was one of the busier stores of the area so there were always loads of customers. Depending on your co-workers and managers, it can be a decent job. But it really depends on your co-workers."
good,"I was able to stay busy working at lowes, I worked in the back assembling orders and displays. I also went on deliveries to help with the short staffed delivery crew."
good,Terrible hours. Pay was not enough to live off of. Benefits where good in terms of 401k and health insurance. But other than that I don't recommend it.
good,Lowes is a good place to work and offers job advancement.  They are primarily focused on customer satisfaction and putting customers first when helping them improve their homes or projects.
good,Working for National freight hauling for Lowes. 100% no touch freight pickup at the distribution center and deliver to stores. Occasionally pickup a back haul on the way back to the Distribution center.
good,nothing to say about this job or any of the employees. I am just trying to get to the point in this process where I can apply for jobs. stop making me do this
good,"I enjoyed most of time working here, there was advancement for me at the time. I learned a lot of new knowledge and experienced new processes. There are only a small few that made things tough to handle."
good,"When I was working in the lumber department of one of the Fayetteville, Arkansas stores, I got the chance to learn methods of the everyday homeowner maintenance."
good,"Lowe's is transitioning from one CEO to a new CEO.  While this has been a good transition there has been significant changes that the organization is living through.  Once the company gets to the other side and stabilizes, Lowe's will once again be a great place to work"
good,"-you will learn several things from cutting keys to re-keying locks to cutting carpet and vinyl"
good,"Punch in, retrieve all bids from installers, check with install office for any pending issues etc. Go to desk pull all pending orders  and details to be worked up. Wait on customers as they come in. Start working up estimates with labor and materials. Start calling Customers."
good,"Stress Fast Pace"
good,Intense training for a seasonal position. Was released one month early in spite of agreeing to continue on as an assigned permanent employee. (New upper level management decision due to retail facility profit performance?) Increased plant knowledge and became refamiliarized with plants for this zone. Increased customer interaction and their plant project needs. Most difficult was not being kept informed of new plant delivery details. Most enjoyable was being surrounded by a variety of plants - created a pleasant environment. Was told the garden center hadn't looked so good in years.
good,"Pretty good starting pay depending on position. Full time employees work 39 hours/wk with little opportunity for OT (four 8 hr days, one 7 hr day). Bi-weekly pay but the benefits are pretty good. Have to choose which holidays you want paid time off for but Only up to 3 a year. Management is about 30/70 in terms of good and bad. Generally good co workers. The worst part about the job honestly, is having to deal with the moronic people in the general public, otherwise it's a pretty nice chill place."
good,"Your experience is heavily influenced by your manager. There are good managers at lowes. They actually care and understand you have a life outside of lowes. There are also managers that not only don't care, but openly don't care. They'll never tell you to your face, but behind closed doors you know it's happening, and its not just your direct supervisor. It goes all the way to the store manager, market director, and perhaps even beyond. The schedule at lowes is at times unbearable for full time staff, clopens happen regularly, and weekends are mandatory. shifts range from 530am to 11pm. It's not all bad. The pay is nothing to complain about. The co-workers are generally nice to be around and customers most of the time aren't so bad. But get yourself under a good manager that cares, it can make an enormous difference."
good,Most of the managers were friendly. BUT they tell you how to treat customers and perform daily operations that they themselves do not abide by. Schedules are never correct and constantly changing. They expect you to check it online by midnight to see if your schedule has changed.
good,Lowe's is very much a seasonally driven retail environment depending on the dept you worked in. Unrealistic sales goals as manager and staffing was generally and issue
good,this job is very fast pasted job not enough employees in the store at any one time one person in each department at night work list were to many and bad management and not always available to help you.
good,"I worked the night shift at Lowes. The co-workers were nice, but the job is hard. If you can't lift heavy stuff, then this job is not for you. Night Stock involved doing day shift's job on top of the nightly trucks."
good,"It is a good place to work, you will learn a lot. The environment is great, people are great and the company is great. You will love it there go a head and apply."
good,"As a retail associate, our customers come first. My typical day at work involves watering all the plants in the garden center. "
good,getting orders organized by pulling orders and calling customers to confirm deliveries. In between going around to store and helping other departments and customers
good,"I was okay.  "
good,The departments are understaffed and overwhelmed. It's a company that could do better but they try and get with as little as possible and pay that as little as possible.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. Management was ok. They teach a lot. I went to several departments in the store. Management was easy to talk to also
good,"Inconsistent schedule"
good,"I don't really mind working for Lowe's that much, I don't particularly like working at the Customer Service Desk (for obvious reasons), but a good number of the people are work with are great to be around. The pay is pretty good compared to other customer service jobs in the area (above minimum wage), but sometimes I wonder if it's really worth the abuse I get from some of my customers and the way a couple of managers treat me like I'm stupid and can't do my job. There also isn't to great of an opportunity to transfer to other departments, especially if you're really good in a particular one. Otherwise, the benefits are great and even PT employees get them, so it's not too bad."
good,People at Lowes are nice and I enjoy working with customers needs and questions.  Salary is low and the working hours are not consistent.  You are on your feet for nine hours per shift.  Lowes offers 10% discount to employees and military.
good,El tiempo que labore para la empresa lowes me fue muy grato ya que el personal es muy atento
good,"I learned how to work well with others in a friendly environment."
good,"I never planned to stay forever at this job. It was the way for me to move from Raleigh, NC to Dallas, TX. I was full time in NC and requested a transfer. I started in Dallas as full time and moved to part-time."
good,"typical day at work was helping customers purchase products along with designing and selling cabinets"
good,Summer hire in the Lawn and Garden Dept.  Enjoyed co-workers while working.  Great summer job for a high school or college student.  Lisa Allen was a great manager to work for.
good,"a lot of randomness"
good,Being a young educated male working my way up the pole to get closer to my career. I took any opportunities that was given to me to advance my experience and with better pay.
good,You have 9 total manegers that tell you what to do and need to get done in a day. You have one assigned to you but its like for scedulling and such. Its pretty stupid.
good,"A normal day at Lowes, would consist of , grab your vest , clocking in and then go to your assigned station or area. Then helping any customers that need help, once complete check with your manager to see if you have any assignments that he/she needs complete."
good,"Pay was low, retail hours, co-workers very nice. Management has no clue. Worked hard and was not worth it, learned a lot and customers were for the most part very nice."
good,"It can be between an 8hr day or 5hr day. I've learned how to work with power equipment, such as lawn mowers, pole saws, weed eater,chainsaw; and a blower."
good,"nice place to work for.  company is very likeable.  good prices, nice culture.  friendly .  hours are good.  hours are fair.  everyone gets along with each other. good place to learn good work habbits"
good,Typical day is 11-12 hours. Store management has little regard for others sometimes. There is a divide in the upper management team ever since the stores had restructure done. The company is great but experience varies location to location. I love to merchandise and help people. Sometimes our processes are so convoluted that customers experience is awful which in turn has the customers take it out on the staff
good,its cool....just can be boring and well... boring. You dont really see much or get to do alot of cool things its just a simple.. eh... job.. it gets the bills paid
good,I worked here during the steel set. I trained in another store while the steel set was getting started. I worked for Lowe's for 2 years before I had to move.
good,"I have worked for this company for many years, I have learned from this company. I have always done well financially by working for the company. They offered a chance for advancement"
good,"Good pay, but it's corporate retail.  If you enjoy listening to customers complain, this is the job for you.  It's not a hard job at all, but if you spend enough time with the company....it will eventually wear on you."
good,"Typical day is dealing with grumpy and fussy customers. You learn how not to take thing to personal. Just like every job has it favoritism but the store I work at defiantly had a lot of favoritism especially among mangers. Some managers suck up to main bosses instead of explain to main bosses what works and what doesn't. Managers always panic when main bosses came down for walk store. To the point the wait to the day before and had workers cleaning and doing projects that take a week to do. Expected to be done that day with little help. Its a very stressful workplace especially if your were not in the main clicks at the store. "
good,it is a good place to work if you like to stay busy. the pay is pretty good and the work to life balance is also pretty good. you also get bonus pay for performance
good,"I can't speak to the current state of this company as i have not been there in years. But, i do keep abreast of what is happening in the company. But not enough to give a current review."
good,"Low paying, good, entry level position or part time. benefits are good with matching 401k. employee discounts on all store products, even clearance items."
good,Not a bad job while going to school. Don't see much reason to try and make a career out of working here. Not as many benefits as they used to have like commission.
good,I would get there 4 or 5 am to unload the truck if i was a min late i was loved out only got 3 days out the week to work. And ut didnt have a family feeling too it.
good,"Was a good learning experience and an easy job while going to school. "
good,"Greeting all customers in a professional manner. "
good,"If you are on the in crowd then its good but if you are on the outside you will just remain an underneath person, nothing more nothing less. Many talented employees left because they simply were not valued by management."
good,"The job was alright for a summer job. Made a pretty decent amount of money to pay for school and living expenses. Had a decent amount of hours per week, was very stressful but a good job."
good,I do not want to leave a review of this employer. It was a temporary job while I was in college. The part time position barely paid for the child care I needed to work there.
good,"They try to get you busy when you don't have customers. They have you restock the things up by the register, go get carts, or take merchandise back to its department."
good,Large staff working everywhere. Workers willing to help other workers. Flexible hours. Work with school hours or school hours. Helps if you need more hours.
good,Lowe's is an amazing company. Working for Lowe's has been a pleasure. The people are kind and understanding. This job definitely requires communication skills - whether it be with your coworkers or the customers.
good,"Good place to work.Worked as a team.Learned a lot about warehouse control and operations.Used bar code readers for product control.cycle count. On Hand.shortages.cyce count,shipment,reciveing. Loading and unloading trucks.forklift operations and different types.Safty"
good,"Job satisfaction and management is entirely contingent on position and what store you work in. I happen to be in a decent store with friendly and helpful employees. I enjoy the challenge of being a Fulfillment Coordinator because it allows me to work independently and use my cognitive skills to solve problems. It is considered a ""low tier"" management position and I supervise two part-time and one full time fulfillment clerk. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with delayed deliveries, inventory shortages, system issues (such as Sterling program and Genesis systems) and lack of help when needed during busy periods. Previously I worked in tools/hardware and hated it. Since my promotion and move to a store closer to home, I find much more satisfaction in my job. Training is practically nonexistent and I had to learn the ordering system and procedures on my own with little assistance, mostly through trial and error."
good,"Working in a hardware and seasonal store. Many different departments and mangers."
good,"this is a typical retail job, weekends and holidays are worked, you do have a monthly schedule that is usually set so you can have a little bit of a life you don't normally get in a retail environment"
good,"I went to work every morning and had fun with other employees.  At lunch, I either stayed at the store or I went home for lunch.  The end of the day was the best"
good,Working at Lowe's has been a great experience. I've learned a lot from staff and customers. We love where we live and work. The work atmosphere is like family. Everyone is eager and willing to help each other in all departments of the store.
good,Okay job! It's customer service so it's like every customer service job you have every work in your life. Attitude is key... it's what you make out of it.
good,Lowes was a ok company didnt pay enough for the work you did. Lowes was based on sales and computer soft ware not up to date. Lowes also never gave rises.
good,"fast pace work environment with challenges and constant changes. manage a large group of associates with scheduling, training, development and leadership."
good,Fast paced customer facing job where you are constantly on to another task or customer. Limited downtime due to amount of foot traffic coming through the store. Management can be a mixed bag on helpfulness at times but there are so many of them that you just need to find a few to depend on. Coworkers mostly great but training can suffer in some areas as there is not a lot of cross training between departments. With that being said there is usually someone in the department that you can find who is knowledgeable enough if you are willing to take the time to learn. Not a bad place to work but once you get high enough in a store position there's not much room for moving up.
good,Lowes was a very good work environment. I enjoyed working there with the associates. I loved helping the customers with their home projects. Thank you
good,There was very little room for advancement and was not compensated adequately.  I don't even care to include the review but here we are I suppose.  asdf
good,"The experience for this type of job depends on the management in each location,  "
good,I enjoyed what I did for lowes. I learned a lot and also taught people a lot. Management was ok and the people and culture were descent. Hardest part of the job is it was never a set schedule.
good,"Busy day lots to do customer service is critical to the job have to have a good work ethic, work life balance is very hard at Lowe’s because you are always on the clock"
good,Lowes has all the right tools but lacks motivation to order to execute their process in management. Very loose supervision for most employees. A few CSA's do most of the work and the rest are not held accountable.
good,"Typical day consisted of a lot of ER issues"
good,Great group of people to work with as a team. Had your individual projects to do but worked together on the bigger jobs. Communication between upper management and other departments were lacking so that when management asked what associate is doing which is part of the associate's job the management seemed confused.
good,Loews is a good place to work and the envirement is also great brecause the people their will train you and also work together with you. There is always room to go up in this job.
good,Constantly changing shifts making it difficult to balance a home life with work. When working outside in hot weather limited consumption of fluids and hard to stay warm when working outside areas.
good,Stay focus. Make sure the cashiers get breaks and lunches on time. Do most of the managers job without the pay. Tell the same policy to the same customer every time they try to pull another fast one. Know every frigging policy and product placement of the entire company. Teach your boss how to do his job.
good,It was a job that I worked to get by  ut the only thing bad about it is how they let go of half the staff for shift change. Never plan on working for this company again.
good,Limited time for your family. Inconsistent policies year after year. The company couldn't decide on which direction to move and kept on changing. Work and home life was imbalanced.
good,"lowes is a good job, great co workers it is just not where I want to see m self in 5 years.   they  do have cook outs and  feed the employees. bonus sometimes"
good,I was a delivery driver at Lowes. Being able to work outside the actual store was a good thing for me. The in store process was slow paced. I like something a little faster.
good,Had a bad experience at the end of my employment with Lowe’s. We knew the store was in trouble but they said things were fine and our jobs were safe. I turned down a position at another store because I was asked to stay. Only to find out shortly after with a one day notice that they were shutting the store down and we would be jobless. It was a very stagnant job market in 2011 so the search was difficult for new work.
good,Lowe's is almost there when it comes to competing with Home depot. They need to look at management and sales techniques to help drive sales production at the store level.
good,"Haven't worked here in more than 12 years. Relaxed work enviroment, no overttime allowed, low pay for adults trying to make a living. Workload was reasonable."
good,I was having a big problem with depression at this time.  I was not giving the job the 100% that I normally do with any position.  I had suffered the death of someone who meant more to me than  my own life.
good,I like it but they don’t work with you if you have another job. Some management are very rude. My manager is great. If you work hard you are not recognized for it but the people who do t work as hard get everything.
good,"complete my daily tasks then self trained on cash register and all other departments and customer service, when had time did most of all the assembly that needed to be done for the floor models"
good,I enjoy the company and the pay incentive. The managers are nice and fun and the human resource manager is very ongoing and always get the job done. Everything was nice
good,"I enjoy the work environment at lowes, the management system is very helpful and caring. I would recommend this job for anyone on a entry level looking for a job"
good,Long nights without a full crew can be detrimental to your sanity but as long as you have a semi-full crew you will make it through the night. After a couple of nights you should have the basics down and after that comes mastering the craft. Beware of seasonal employment they will pull the wool over your eyes.
good,"Customer friendly... But the stores culture atmosphere has changed. "
good,Work life balance is terrible for the service managers. It is not just my store but across the board service managers are not happy. Staffing always seems to be an issue.
good,I took this job because my family needed the supplemental income.  I enjoyed the work I did and the people I worked for.  I left Lowe's to be a preschool teacher.
good,Lowes was a complicated store to work for because of bad management and improper time management.  Their inventory was constantly low due to lack of quality control from their department managers
good,"Too much work for little pay, the team environment is good but ASMs don't seem to care about floor staff, they get paid a lot more than floor staff and act that way as well. Too much change in policy and corporate."
good,okay to work for. Co-workers make the job. would recommend for high school student or as a part time ;job for someone that is attending college. Managers are okay.
good,The Management at the Lowes that I was employed was not honest in their Inventory investigations. The former manager is no longer employed with Lowes.
good,"This company is straight average , no thrills , alot of ups and downs . They removed alot of different positions which pretty much distroyed careers and such."
good,Worked up to several management postions only to part of the management team to be forced into a lower pay scale postion for financial gain for company
good,The most part I loved working at Lowes that was able to transfer to three places with ease! Florida Lowe's was very diverse group. Indiana Lowe's I was trained in every department so that made me valuable to the company.
good,"Lowes has a great mission statement, finding the right store with management that inspires it's employees to provide excellent customer service is the real key to success for the entire store. The Company is headed in the right direction. I think the hardest part of working there was that you were not allowed to plan your day. When you arrived to work anything that you were planning for your people was not considered important and you were directed to fill your day with someone else's ideas for your day. Basically what they hold you responsible for you are never allowed to work on."
good,"Not enough hrs/take about 3hrs to finish the truck.sometime truck don't show up on the days you work .good employee's, they are helpful and well trained"
good,Lowes is a good place to work for but the management could be better and advancement in the company/store is a little aggravating. But i do like helping the customers and making sure they find what they are looking for and have a good shopping experience.
good,"Provided a job at a time that I needed one.  Management only cares about the money, how much we made yesterday and what we need to make today.  If you work full time in the slow season they can cut hours to less than 40 hrs.  If you are part time, you may not work at all.  Store manager killed the morale and upper management didn't care.  I felt I made a good hourly rate."
good,"I really enjoy working at Lowes Home Improvement. Management is okay for the most part, besides a fee members of management and their poor attitudes, but overall I would recommend working for Lowes."
good,Invironments there are good no tension.  Fast paced.  Management works with you. Store has their hr manager there.  Open door policy. Fun place to work at always having cookouts for our 60 days no accidents.
good,"good space to learn and interact with customer.differnt hours so you can work and go to school, just the late night shift are not good if you have kids."
good,"You would need to experience it for yourself.  I can not answer. "
good,Personally loved my local Lowes. The people were amazing. However different stores have different settings. So make sure to walk around and see if the location is a right fit for you.
good,"Lowe's was an overall fun place to work. Most of the managers were very nice and understanding, with the exception of few. But the people that worked there were a lot of fun. None of them took themselves too seriously and that was very refreshing. Dealing with the contractors was by far the hardest part of the job. They had very little patience or tolerance for waiting for things at all. They also had the expectation that everyone in the world should know what took them a lifetime of contracting to learn."
good,Loved it meet people every day and fun with the employees. Pay attention and learn all the different stuff they sell some things don’t have price tags or bar code
good,"Typical Big Box Retailer, not much else to say about them than that. They have concrete floors and you will be on your feet all day so remember to invest properly in very comfortable shoes."
good,I work at the customer service desk. It seems like customers come in and whine and stamp their feet and get what they want. It makes it hard to do my job according to the policies that are the policies that are supposed to be set forth for every one to follow. My coworkers are the best part of the job
good,Lowe’s has some good employees working for them. Did a lot of walking so wear comfortable and closed toe shoes. Overall a decent company to work for..
good,"Twelve hours straight is a tough shift on your feet constantly lifting, bending, and moving.  So if you like a fast paced environment................."
good,There where good people there and a decent place to work. It was climate  control. They worked with my school scheduled. It just was not  a place for me.
good,"In store merchandiser. Responsible for resets and  revisions, point of sale pricing including price changes. Provided customer  service by assisting customers with their service needs"
good,Would not recommend it unless you like being constantly told what to do after another supervisor asked you to do something else. Constantly interrupting you when helping costumers and not very professional
good,I have worked at Lowes for about 2 years. During that time I have had 4 manager changes and have always been in the same department. There are never enough employees at Lowes.
good,"I started at Lowe's in 2007 at the end of the housing boom and work life was great! Everyone was happy and staffing was excellent. After the housing bubble burst, staffing was cut and service suffered in order to keep the upper crust within range of their bonuses. Management became progressively individualized and less team focused. Nobody would back each other up and Lowe's became synonymous with ""easy refunds""; especially on non-Lowe's products. I would work for Lowe's again because I believe they are still a good company overall but not for the one I came from."
good,"the company was okay to work for, they would give two days off a week. but the corp. rotation was rough to get used to, and the hours were not stable or dependable"
good,Lowe’s is nice for a stepping stone.   This job is a new opportunity in the beginning the hours are nice they try some mangement try  to listen. And work with you .
good,"Lowe's employees are fun and enjoy where they work. A lot is expected of you and not returned as far as you personal life. They want you to sacrifice, but will not sacrifice."
good,"Very autocratic leadership.  Spent more time in the managers office and watching my back than accomplishing my day to day job.  No autonomy on the job.  Managers were afraid of leadership, direction was driven by fear.  HR was not for the employee, EEO was not practiced for those not of color."
good,Was not enjoyable it was very cutthroat there was no job security hours were in consistent never knew if I was going to have a job one day to the next
good,"I worked at lowes while I was going to college and they were flexible with me schedule. The management was good"
good,deliver customer products to the homes from building needs to outdoor and indoor product all based on what they bought and deliver the product without damages
good,I was a cashier. I was responsible for ringing customer's purchases up. I really enjoyed meeting so many new people which would be the most enjoyable part of my job. The hardest part of my job was dealing with managers and head cashiers.
good,"Lowe's is a decent workplace if you're looking for something temporary. It's great for your first job, it is not however a permanent job/career. The pay is not competitive, nor is it enough for the job they require of you."
good,"Stressful , too much work and not enough employees . Management is fair but over worked as well. HR reps are too busy to address your concerns. Its all about stats and numbers.. Love where you live? How about you help your employees LOVE where they work after all, they are the ones that make YOU the money!"
good,The work environment with coworkers is nice but corporate and upper management is left wanting. It took over three years in order to get my first raise and I was a lucky one.
good,"i really enjoyed my job and most of my co-workers. i enjoyed my customers and helping them when they needed it. it was a lot of time that certain management played favorites with certain employees, and some were just there to get a paycheck and made it difficult for others to do their jobs."
good,worked in garden center most of the time. dealt with weather predicaments and sometimes no breaks. poor management. on the positive side enjoyed talking with customers.hardest part was getting a hold of management and loaders.
good,I liked the job. People were hard to get along with if they don't like you it is hard to work with. Customer were fun and liked talking to then. that is what was nice about working their
good,Good place to work.  I started at a tools and hardware associate then was promoted to receiving manager then promoted again to night operations manager.  paid well.
good,Hired on as Cashier but mostly worked in customer service shortly after getting hired. Dealt with customers orders and returns. Was usually very busy. i enjoy being able to help people and a lot of on floor sales associates were not very helpful to customers so I always went out of my well to help but because I was so good in customer service they would never give me the opportunity to work on the floor which eventually led me to leave the company. They also had me doing more work that they did not want to pay me for. I did learn to deal with terrible customers respectively and simmer down an angry customer. Also dealt with large sums of cash.
good,"lay off management only looking for part time,any time over 15 years you must find another job.company will not keep you long term any more ,most empolyees are part time"
good,I think Lowe's could be a really good company to work for. I think it mainly depends on the upper management in each store. With good consistent managers I think it could be a good store to work for.
good,The employees work to keep shelves stocked organized and clean. We assisted the customers in finding product and help out majority departments to clean an stock products.
good,"I don't regret my time spent with Lowe's in the slightest; it was a tremendous opportunity, and I made a lot of fantastic connections. Every store feels like a close-knit family, even if that family is a tad dysfunctional and doesn't always mesh well together. The relationships I made felt very personal and genuine during my nearly two years within the company, and it made working in a busy and chaotic environment much easier. That being said, my particular store was horribly understaffed, maintaining just an over-worked and stretched-thin skeleton crew who no longer felt appreciated or welcomed by in-store and district management, and the lack of communication or care drove many more hard-working employees out. Lack of tact and professionalism by store management, not being allowed to move into a position with different hours that I was hired into months prior, and declining work conditions eventually drove me out of the company."
good,It was a great job. I enjoyed the experience. I loved my job and would go back in a heart beat. I worked in the paint department and had a great time interacting with customers. The taking care of pallets of goods was very difficult but I enjoyed it
good,You can only get a promotion is when you chit chat with management the hard works are normally not recognized. They have no back bone for the employees that have been there for years but are not following the policy's or being responsible.
good,"Good place to be. I really did not want to put anything into this section but it is not giving me any kind of a choice. Pay was good, hours were always different every week no matter what."
good,"At the time I worked for Lowe's there was a high turn over in the upper management of our store and region. This put a lot of stress on the middle management and caused many issues.  "
good,its was the people i was around i learn a lot from them . they showed me different things around the store and i was a pretty good stocker for the store i done what has to be done that's was my jb .
good,"Lowes is a good company to work for if you are going to school they are flexible with your schedule and if you are looking for full time they like to hire within the company. The management is okay in the company, but in order to work here you need extensive knowledge on products for home improvement."
good,"As a associate working at the front end, my job is mainly to cash out customers as well as work the Customer Service Desk doing returns and such. The store I work at can be quite chaotic at times, but the other staff do their best against such great odds to help each customer love where they live. I'm glad I'm part of this team, and can't wait to see it get better over time."
good,The store is ran by a store manager who had never worked in management before and does not know even the basics that cashiers know. Most employees are great and fun to work with but management believes you shouldn’t talk to others at all even while getting work done so they kind of kill what could be a fun work environment
good,"We drive out and deliver appliances to customers, appliances can be stoves, washers and dryers, refrigerators, and dishwashers or other items management orders us to deliver."
good,"Enjoyed working with the public and aid them in making decisions about what they were wanting to purchase.  Worked at providing options for the customer of available products as possible.  This was one of my favorite opportunities in working in this position."
good,Very busy every day at work.Varied work hours. All co-workers were friendly and hard working. I learned something new everyday. Serving the customer and learning everyday was the best part of the job.
good,Lowe's is an okay company with great perks and great benefits however they are known for random mass layoffs and there is difficulty with advancement within the company.  Overall pay is great.
good,"Once again, it i a very top down style of management which is not conducive to a friendly work environment between the staff and management. I would not recommend working here"
good,Part-time positions are not compensated enough in pay or benefits and the company is moving towards a model that changes all non-supervisor roles to part-time positions. It paid the bills (barely) while I finished school but there is no future here.
good,Retail was never where I belonged. I spent my time with the company always thinking I  would be done and move on soon. The time never happened for me.
good,I think lowes is a great place to work we inquire different circumstances every day with our customers and we love helping people love where they live and work.
good,"The location I worked at wasn't that great. Cashier's are always left to clean up after other departments. If lumber went home before sweeping, or straightening up, it was the cashier's job to do it. Same for all other departments. It always fell onto the cashier's. I particularly thought that was inexcusable. You could have 2+ years customer service experience, and someone with less than one will get paid more than you because they have a degree. Last time I checked, you don't need a degree to stand behind a register."
good,"I hope one day Lowes allows multiple employees to be trained in multiple departments, or at least allows a rotation. It benefits employees and especially customers to know about top questions in a certain department (when there is no coverage) as opposed to sending constant phone calls to management. Better to know a little of everything than know nothing."
good,Worked for 11 years. The job was not hard that I had. It could be fulfilling. but sometimes upper management was very hard to deal with. Expected you to do the job with as little resources as possible.
good,"I enjoy helping customers make choices on products for their home."
good,some days extremely  busy. .once you reach top out in your grade level raises appear to be done.company match on stock is nice.the people i work with function together well.
good,I have worked for lowes for the past 3 years I started off as seasonal cashier. I went to part time at the end of the season and was given full time last year. I have moved positions for a more consistant work schedule.
good,"Work for Lowes's 6+ years and can't get anymore raises. Plus there is no advancement for me. I'm basically stuck in this position unless I leave. The culture at my store is stressful, and fast paced at times. Employees always past the buck when things need to get done. The managers pass other employees job duties on to the good employees and never address the issues with the employees who don't do their job. I'm ready to leave and I need a change. As a Facility Service Associate, I don't get paid what I'm worth for all the work I have to do. This job is not worth the hassle anymore."
good,There are a lot of good people that work there. Alot are hard workers. Some slackers too. There's alot of new workers right now. Lost alot of the old staff so it's stressful. If you know alot cause you've been there a while your pulled in many directions at once.
good,"The job is constant customer service anywhere from loading things into their cars to finding items in the store, and or ringing them out on the cash register. Hard to plan life around retail hours, the hours change on a dime."
good,"While working for Lowes , I learned to make sure that your register was not short or missing money. This was the first job that I worked as a cashier. I didn't like the way that they ran the registers. Everyone ran off the same till when you worked on the register. That is why I learned to ensure that you made sure that your register was correct every time you got off it."
good,"This job was great, I loved my customers and what I did their, I just wish it wouldve paid more. 9 dollars an hour is a bit difficult to live on for anyone."
good,The only problem I have with Lowe’s is the scheduling. I gave them an availability and they completely ignore it. I don’t feel that is right. What’s the point of giving it to them if they just ignore it
good,"scheduling repair service for customers"
good,I would load my own delivery truck and also pull the appliances need to be delivered. when arriving at the customers house i would unload using a dolly and bring the appliances in the homes and install
good,Fast day at Lowes. Learned how to work fast. Management was friendly. Workplace culture was quite. Hardest part of the job was picking up the slack for employees who called out. I enjoyed listening to music.
good,All the good management has been fired or moved on. It has been three years since I worked there so I don't know how the work environment has changed since.
good,"Just need to be given a fair chance to be understand and show how hard working I am.  I know what I can do and want to be made aware of that without being treated unfairly.  I love any kind of work I do, and try my best to do it well. Just need the chance to show it fairly and respectfully"
good,Lowes runs a skeleton crew at all times and expects to keep customers and employees happy. Customers are angry and employees are worked until they have nothing left to give.
good,"Most managers and people “high up” are good. A lot of work incentives giving you a chance to win different things such as food and Lowes merchandise and such. Only downside is that when there is a problem, it is hard to get someone to change the situation. Good hours for seasonal employees, and good money. For a first job, it is really good. Would recommend."
good,"Organization is important for success. However sometimes there can be more programs to concentrate on completing, that the most important assets, such as the customers, are often seen as a nuisance in the process of completing the tasks that are designed to improve customer's experiences and satisfaction. If you focus entirely on making the store perfect, yet overlook the perfect experience of the customers, it might as well change the name to Wal-Mart."
good,"I am only here for a small amount of time. I switched my position here because I wanted a more stable schedule. Working here I not a terrible, however, it is not a great environment."
good,You are expected to work long hours with little support from management. The work atmosphere between managers was terrible and everyone seemed to blame each other.
good,If you are ok with working anywhere from 5:30am to 12 am Lowes is a good work place. They have health benefits and paid vacation for full and part time employees.
good,"Outside garden employees deserve higher pay, some people think we just work with plants, when it is so much more. Many days are fast paced and physically demanding, must operate power equipment. Operating a forklift makes you a liability, you can get hurt,others can get hurt,and things can be damaged, there is no pay bump for receiving your license.I started at $11.77, and guys who have been there longer than me make less than that,lowest wages in the dept. A head cashier makes $15.00 per, I get it, they want to pay more to people that handle their money, but for all our responsibilities, the pay should not be that big of a difference. I've been fortunate to have a great manager (13 yrs exp.) and great coworkers. I was hired as seasonal full time, 3 weeks into the season and hours are already getting cut for everyone in dept, overtime has been cut indefinitely from above"
good,poor mangament did not know how to talk to employees and alot of back stabbing . Alot of good people left or were let go because of poor management which is really sad
good,"The store manager was a jerk, who didnt care much for many employees, and the only manager willing to help you quit, so there was not much keeping me there."
good,"Worked in appliances, plumbing, electronics, shipping and receiving and outside garden dept.. I was pretty versatile in all deptmartments I did everything and operated everything such as the cherry picker forklift etc..."
good,I only worked here for a short time. It felt like forever. It was really hard for me to quit due to I love my front end manager. The training was very inconsistent they throw you were ever they need you I am not use to bouncing around on jobs. A lot of the managers were rude which was surprising to me cause managers are to lead by example.. Some were mean and just looked like they didn't want to be there. Overall its a place for teens and college kids to get there feet wet in the work industry.
good,"Average company. Each location is dependent on management. In my time at Lowes (3 years), there have been 3 different store managers.Each reign was vastly different."
good,Lowes is a good place to work but like most big box stores is a cutthroat business and caters to a good ole boy network for upward mobility in the company
good,"Wasn't what i expected, mean and bossy staff, no open hours or any overtime  was averaging 5 hours a week by the time i quit due to lack of proper hour management."
good,Stressful and schedule is inconstant.  Fast pace work environment. You will learn customer service in any part of the store. Must be willing to help a customer at all times.
good,pretty relaxed comfortable work place. Learned how to work a forklift pretty quickly although heavy machinery comes naturally for me. workplace is very diverse. Hardest part of my job would have to be tolerating my income. most enjoyable part would have to be working by myself at times
good,"you will work your tail off here and no one is willing to help eachother. if you need something done, do not expect to get any help with any of your tasks."
good,the job tasks are always the same and never really difficult but the amount of work and the lack of help is frustrating.  I still found a way to get my tasks done but was always hounded by management to do more than i had time for.
good,"•	Unload merchandise from warehouse truck."
good,"the management at lowes is ok. they handle things professionally but the way the time fashion they handle it in is deathly slow. the work is consistent, I personally don't think certain job titles on the job were being compensated enough"
good,it was a good company as well. my job was to recieve oreders for ups truck and all shippments that entered into the warehouse. also to stock shelves when needed
good,"come in and get my cash drawer, count it up, go to my spot that want me, start checking out customers. go to the back when the truck comes and help unload"
good,Not a bad place to work. they will cut down your hours unexpectedly if you are temp. coworkers may not be as motivated as you are. the hour break was excessive.
good,I really like the company but the working conditions of the warehouse were a health threat.  There was no clear line of management and the human resources officer was hardly ever on site as promised.  The job itself was satisfying and fun at times.
good,had very poor management. it is definately not one of those jobs that has a good family work balance especially if you have a family.  spent more time at work than home.
good,"its good if you want laid back and not much responsibility, when it's slow it's dead and when it's busy (all of 2x out of the day) its busy but everyone is out for themselves or out screw you over"
good,"As a seasonal employee that transferred to a full-time/part-time position, I learned many jobs. Originally just a loader in the garden center all I was expected to learn was location of relevant products and be able to lift heavy objects for customers. Eventually I did learn that, and how to be a cashier, and how to do customer service, and how to do internet orders, and how to operate a forklift, and how to do inventory. Yet there was no pay raise and negotiating hours was needlessly difficult. Work environment usually kept a steady pace, and depending on where one worked could expect to see constant activity with little downtime. Many areas felt understaffed which led to more stressful work and more high-strung employees."
good,"I'm not generally in the store because I spend most of my time on the deliveries truck but, I can tell you that Lowe's will not hesitate to bend over backwards for a customer especially at the expense of your time. "
good,The management was at the time alright but could have used improvement on managerial decisions and delegations. I found that the day to day life at this job was mostly base level retail requirements for lower pay than is suppose to be given.
good,"Lowe's was a good company to work for. Even though it was a fast paced environment, I appreciated the friendly atmosphere. As Front End Manager I concentrated on team effort, and it felt more like family than a regular job."
good,Enjoyed working with most coworkers. Left to our own devices to solve problems. Management fixated on bottom line and emphasized pushing credit. Recently started program that required Pro Specialists to cold call for pro account sign ups.
good,Lowe's allowed me the freedom to grow as a sales professional while providing a structure that rewards sales excellence and promotes growth within the company.
good,"Worked here for 2 years, gave 100% every day, but didn't feel appreciated due to lack of getting a raise based on performance. They only give a yearly raise that doesn't match the rise of the cost of living. Hard work, but pretty easy if you're not lazy. Bonuses are rare and minuscule compared to other companies. A typical day is about 12 hours with anywhere up to 16 deliveries of appliances (refrigerators, washers, dryers, etc) to customers' homes. Hard Work doesn't pay off if you finish 14 deliveries in a timely manner they send you back out to do a couple more. The hardest part is running into tough situations that are time consuming. Management only seems to care about the customer and not the well-being of employees. The best part was working with different people."
good,"The benefits and time off is pretty good, but the pay and upward mobility is pretty bad. It's a good job for retirees who really just need the benefits. It's not really a good fit for young people trying to make a career."
good,"not enough hours, your promised positions if you apply but then you don't get hired. Hours were not consistent, it was slow at times with nothing to do. I wish it was a little more fast paced."
good,"Many friendly people work within Lowe's. Management is willing to give time off for personal reasons. Management is also approachable and friendly, creating a fun work environment."
good,Lowes is a great job. The work that you preform is fairly easy and being self sufficient is a great skill to have for this job. They pay competitive wages and are understanding of family emergencies if you have children.
good,I love my co workers but as a company I do believe they're very unorganized. I will also say that management makes the job extremely hard because they never want to face the customer. Their very quick to put the front liners on the line when faced with adversity. I believe this company would be a lot better if it took ownership in its flaws so that effective change can take place.
good,"hard to understand where you fit in as an employee."
good,enjoyed working there in begining but customer flow has dipped and company structure doesnt make alot of sense to have that many different managers in one store
good,Continuous changes with a short period of time.  spent a lot of time moving desk from bldg to bldg.  There were a few turn over in CEO.  Supervisors wasn't sure what the company was doing with that but some of the managers were let go that I feel shouldn't have been.
good,*Steady
good,I liked working at Lowes. The employees & customers were a bright spot for the most part. Company restructuring caused things to change though so I left.
good,"People are hard at work inside Lowe's 24 hours a day, so any role at any time means coming in to a fast-paced environment. When each member of the team knows their role well, the mechanisms in place  function very smoothly, and the people you work with generally understand each other's struggles, even when they often times butt heads. And all of this with customers floating in and oat. It can be a lot to handle at peak times."
good,"Personally, I like working here. My coworkers make working here fun and as an artist I love being able to help people with their DIY projects. However the company now expects a full open availability which I unfortunately cannot work around with my husband's work schedule."
good,lowes is a ok place to work for extra money depending on the position. what i learned was how to return items also i learned how to send appliances out for repair and shrink wrap large items on pallets.
good,"Learning a new job can sometimes be un-nerving, but not so in this case. Everyone was very eager to help and there was no such thing as a stupid question. This made it feel more like a family."
good,"The hours were always changing all the time, you never knew what your schedule was or when you would be off. Get delivery's pulled and ready to load and then take off to get your list complete. We would install and make sure that the merchandise worked best for the customers needs without anything being damaged or messed up with the property."
good,"Its retail!  Expect to work weird hours like nights, weekends and even Mid shifts to provide coverage to all employees, which happen to be scheduled 24-7, 365.  They also expect you to work 6 days and only pay you for 5.  It was aggravating because it was expected regardless of workload.  Its easy and safe work however it is RETAIL.  It comes with the territory.  Also, when I worked for them the bonus system they had in place really made it possible to earn a lot of money! If all the numbers were hit at the end of the year you received a bonus for 40% of your salary as an HR Manager.  That really bumped up the yearly earnings and made it seem like the 6th day per week you gave to them was almost worth it."
good,"went in at 4am to unload a 40ft truck. i put the merchandise on the proper pallet that it belonged on because each department had it’s own pallet/(s). then after we unload, we take the pallets to the correct department and then we stocked the merchandise on the shelves."
good,Nice place for someone who is looking for a part time job while working through school or in high school. Best to have a working knowledge of hardware
good,"good working environment and friendly co workers, always puts the customers first and always making sure that they our satisfied leaving the store. Great discounts"
good,require to operate machinery that was unfamiliar and one one would listen to the request for help.also being assigned a job or task and then for know reason being replaced with some one else because they cried to supervisor
good,"retail job like any other, nothing really can be said. Management was nice enough but retail is retail, it all depends on the customers as to how well the day goes."
good,"I love my job. The customers are great, co-workers are great. Some of the managers actually do their job. During the busy season there is just not enough people and the stress boils over to everyone."
good,"My typical day is running from 7 AM until 11 AM when there usually is a lull in traffic. I work receiving, so it's all running and power equipment, unloading and moving stock. We have an almost mandatory routine to keep lunches from being missed. We usually don't catch a break until the last hour, around 3 usually, when we can finally sit down to do the office portion and hope no trucks are still late."
good,"I did not mind working with Lowe's. The company was very simple to come in with very little experience, and the training was fairly simple and easy to follow."
good,Overall not a bad place but there is no overtime hours and pay is low job type for someone that just got to high school or someone that is desires a part-time job
good,"pay benefits, and bonus are great. But metrics are very stressful, and the job isnt for everyone.Need a tough skin for this job or else it isnt for you."
good,Only problem was that they would purposely understaffed and asked a lot of their stocking crew. Days always ended up being longer than other staff members who seemed able to come and go as they pleased with no problem. But was indeed a good job.
good,"A retail environment focusing on home improvement. As with many places, you have good management and bad.  You are dealing with the public on a daily basis which can be rewarding and stressful."
good,"Being in the retail field there's really no room for advancement, the pay wasn't that great. There was never any available overtime so it was hard to try and pay the bills on the salary that I made"
good,I don't remember a lot of my time at Lowe's in particular. It was quite a few years back. I help build and put together what was a brand new store in the Metro Detroit Area.
good,A lot of problems occur here where there is an unbelievably high expectation rate for the job to be done. It does keep you busy however you cant make any hours nor can you receive a decent wage from such a massive company.
good,"Lots of work to be done all the time. Must be self motivated. The store management change frequently and they do not communicate very well together.  Not a bad place to work, not a great one either"
good,"If you are looking for a job to make friends this place fits, it was a very welcoming environment and seemed like such a great place to work. There is a little drama, but it comes with any job. Management is friendly and they try and resolve issues at hand"
good,"Started as a delivery driver, was forced to work up to 13 hours a day almost every day. management would force deliveries onto you at the last minute at the end of the day after you were done with everything else"
good,Lowes is a huge company with several stores and mostly ran by corporate rules. its mostly helping customers and trying to sell as much merchandise as possible.
good,There is no standing idle at lowes. There is always something to take care off. That was good because it makes the day go by fast.  even though it is a lot of hard work the people that work there became like a 2nd family and it is fun to come to work.
good,Helping people turn their home into a place they are proud of. Developing relationships with clients to provide one stop shopping. Seeing the fruits of your hard work through the customers returning and seeking you out.
good,There seemed to be more managers than were needed at the time I worked there.  I think things have changed quite a bit since then.  A person would need to be trained to have knowledge of different departments to assist when needed.
good,Lots of great people but too much is asked of too few to get jobs done consistently well and on time.  People never feel caught up.  Managment is respectful but not given enough payroll hours to spend to employ enough people to fairly distribute job responsibilities.  The employees that really care end up feeling like it's up to them to complete work with integrity and quality but they never are able to stay caught up with assignments leading to stress that builds over time.  Burnout is inevitable.
good,"Lowe's was constantly challenging me to better myself, to push harder, to never give up. Though some of the customers were indeed very challenging, I rather enjoyed my four years of working there."
good,The job was easy and the pay was acceptable. I cleaned and sold doors and windows daily. The people I worked with were team players but the management was bad. I enjoyed the people I worked.
good,Everything about this job was just fair pay was fair coworkers fair management fair however some days the work was almost crippling and the demands to do so were high.
good,"The amount of work and hard labor that is involved with a job like this, the company should be paying the employees a lot more money than what they are getting."
good,It was A Good Place To Work . and the co-workers Are a great group Of poeple to work with. management  Was good but I Did Not talk Very often Too The hire-ups.
good,"Although a very long commute, the store was fast paced and could be very challenging helping the amount of customers. Never a dull moment. Fast paced environment."
good,Constantly evolving. Customer base is wide ranging. Always something to learn. Always someone to assist.  The hardest part of the job is probably the work schedule.
good,Seeing as how I have not been with Lowe's long enough to provide a decent review I feel this is pointless to give any fair recommendation. If my hours pick up I could give a better review.
good,"when I get to work I give the cashiers  their morning breaks, help customers find product, I learn new ways on how to better assist customer with any problems. if I have any questions the mangers help out. hardest part of the job I trying to make every customer happy. best part of the job is just having fun."
good,"don't really feel like rating this company, it was a temporary/seasonal position. All I did was customer service and cashiering. good work environment"
good,Great company to work for. Not a lot of drama. But the work can be strenuous. It pays off in the long run. The pay is great depending on how hard you're willing to work
good,"Coorperate restructure caused my position to no longer be required"
good,"Some days you hit the ground running, other days it's very slow, just depending on the season. You're required to be very flexible, going from down-stocking products to running a cash register to helping a customer figure out what service or product best suits their individual needs. It can be very fast-paced depending on how busy the store is and how under-staffed it is. There are opportunities for advancement, which comes with increased pay. The company also gives yearly raises, which can range from a nickel to fifty cents. Health, dental and vision insurance is provided even to part-time employees but it of low quality. Higher quality insurance is provided to full-time employees with a lower or higher premium option."
good,"I was head cashier and It was very stressful in this job, I can handle the stress, but you have to work together as a team in order for it to work out for everyone."
good,I had a plast working there but my feet furt every day after working on the concrete floor. Managment was great. some times were idle times but you could always find something to do if you were a diligent worker.
good,Lowes is a great company to work for if your just starting out. You have to be motivated and have to apply everything you learn to be able to meet customer needs and excel.
good,"Provide excellent customer service by greeting customers, assembling merchandise, prioritizing merchandise for assembly, performing product pre-delivery inspections, and ordering..."
good,"Lowes minimum hours a week for salary were 55+.  Now work/life balance at this company.  In the 4 years I was there I went thru 3 store managers.  One was a horrible person to work with, luckily he was eventually fired."
good,"Great workplace great customers and fellow employees, management was very poor.  The head manager of the store is great the front end manager is the dullest lightbulb in the place."
good,never enough time to do what you needed to do in a day. Never enough help on the floor for customers. co workers were nice and friendly. ok job for part time but not much for advancement.
good,Has to be one of the worst places to work. they expect you to break your back for them and in return give you nothing. they expect nothing but for you to slave while managers walk around doing nothing.
good,"my time at lowes was short lived, the pay was not enough to hardly buy gas and food to get there, I seeked a career in the mining industry directly after"
good,"My ideal working environment is one where there's a good sense of team spirit.  A strong work ethic is obviously important but the human side is also important.  I enjoy working with people who have a decent sense of humor and who, while they might take their work very seriously, don't necessarily take themselves overly seriously!  I like people who are down to earth but who have a dynamic and progressive approach to their work.  I really enjoy working as part of a highly committed and professional team."
good,I took a look at working at Lowe's because I wanted something that could work around the other jobs I was working at the time. Lowes was vey accommodating for my needs.
good,Lowes provides employees with many opportunities to advance into management. Work live balance is a challenge because of the retail hours and holidays. Proper staffing was always a challenge to meet the consumer needs.
good,good job for those who need flexibility to work nights rather than day shift. You have to love to be on your feet and love customers. They do offer great benefits!
good,"It is an okay place to work. I never encounters any issues, do your job and get along with others and it is cake."
good,Short-staffed departments. You usually have to work in 2 or more departments to cover for insufficient personnel on the floor. Cyclical work schedules not conducive to good home life and work balance.
good,"Lowes overall isn't a terrible place to work. I was let go due to cutbacks in the staffing, but I enjoyed my experience while I worked there for as long as I did."
good,The company is a good company to work for its lack of training of its management staff has some pitfalls they promote Within which is great but lack of training and putting people in position in the end is the ultimate failure the company overall pays well which causes it to not have enough Staffing on the sales floor cuz they've overpaid their individuals that work there so if you ever shop at Lowe's good luck on looking for help
good,Relaxed atmosphere yet quick paced. Descent management good pay for the position. only get a half hour for lunch and you are not allowed to  leave the building however.
good,"Lowes is an ok place to work,  they dont hire very much for FT employment , mostly college students,  good atmosphere most employees are friendly    they do offer vac and holiday pay and ins for part time employees"
good,Great for students. Great part-time position. Sufficient starting position and understanding of the procedures relating to the retail market in correlation to online business.
good,Management gets stressed therefore the hourly employees get stressed.  Good benefits available. Most of the training is computerized. Lower level management is relied upon for basic day to day operations and customer service. Compensation does not always rely on experience enough.
good,"I had fairly long shifts and less than desired breaks because of limited staff in the department. The people I worked with were nice, management was good."
good,"Great  staff of employees. Senior management lack adequate training in how to handle an employee base of approximately 120 employees.  Training follow up for the employees needed a great deal of improvement. However, most employees helped each other."
good,"lowes is a good place to work but they dont pay enough for the work that needs to be done. Especially for cashiers, they are the main ones who dont get paid"
good,"A typical day had me running around the parking lot gathering carts and through the store helping customers find merchandise.  I learned that I needed to be cautious about my mouth, if you don't have nice things to say, be cordial and walk away.  Most managers were helpful and hardworking, but a few were leaders and not doers,  The red vest moments were a nice touch and provided some camaraderie.  The hardest part was that the where unorganized, no direct plans were made clear, and a lot seemed to be based on manager whim.  I liked the customers, most were friendly, and even got great stories from them."
good,"I was a part of management and I enjoyed the work schedule. Work was independent and managers didnt micromanage. The partnership with the store manager was very mportant - if they care about safety, and more about the associates than sales then the stores seemed to function better."
good,better be young and able to hustle.
good,"Wide variety of social interactions every day. Great place to learn and practice Customer service. Great place to learn about residential maintenance, remodeling and construction. "
good,"Clock in, and report to a the front end. Take lunch for an hour, then clock back in and report to the front end. Very hard to move around or get cross trained."
good,Good place to work just corporate rules make it difficult on both employees and management.  Fast paced and stressful at times.  Good co workers.  Good hours
good,"Work is fun and can get along with all the co-workers. Can be tedious at times but overall is usually about the same daily. Seems like there is no communication, between managers. Helping neighboring departments with freight, customers, and using power equipment."
good,"This is the place to be if you enjoy retail and people. It's quick paced, can be stressful, rewarding when customer is satisfied, horrible when they aren't. Not for someone who isn't self motivated or is easily hurt by hateful words or ineffective management"
good,"Good company benefits.. work environment was good.. Weekends off, Culture was ok. loved working with customers. Travel was Limited to 100 or less per week"
good,Very fast pace and busy but a overall good place to work. A lot of good people but wish the hours were more available to Assocaites . Place is worth applying for
good,Something to do..nice temp job for a young person. I was just ran in to the ground with the amount of physical labor i had to do and the pay wasn't matching that. It may be better for a adult who is looking to do something after retirement or those who actually want to make it a career.
good,"Lowes is a nice place to work but only if you work there part time or if your a manager or PSE/PSI Specialist. Full time CSA's and sales specialist roles get pressured to do things and done get enough paid enough. Some managers will often put more job duties on full time CSA's and sales specialist that has nothing to do with their actual roles. The poor management at the Lowes I worked at brought the morale of the store down were it was hard to even enjoy the things that made you want to work there in the first place."
good,"fast paced, lack of staff, lack of communication, no seniority, no set schedules. I did learn how to work in a busy environment and how to work as a team. the hardest part is communicating and not being allowed to move up in the company."
good,Not enough qualified people to work most of the jobs.
good,"Currently I am a Seasonal Employee at Lowe's. With Seasonal jobs at Lowe's no benefits are offered. However, so far my experience with the company and the environment has been positive."
good,"Earlier in the years the work was good and productive. Better management personnell that were more helpful. The store had 5 managers in 5 years. Only one was transferred to another Lowes. A typical day at work was generally what you made if it. The hardest part of the job, was being short handed. This invaribly irratated the customers. For the most part, I enjoyed my time at Lowes."
good,*day a work- busy 
good,its was a ok company to wrk for  the management team wasnt all that great  it need a bit of wrk  they were unfair for most of the good workers  they were
good,no big issues with this company since the HR person i dealt with was the reason i was terminated. other than that i didnt have a bad experience working here.
good,This is a retail job and is only for those with good customer interaction skills.  Applicants should have some knowledge of home improvement as there is almost no training.
good,Perfect for those in the field for retail growth its a well rounded stable consistent schedule based job unless people call out but it gets you through a basic standard of living
good,Lowes is one of the best COMPANIES to work for......THE LOCATION is another story! at my store there was alot of favoritism and leniency shown towards they young ladies with long flowy hair and a face full of makeup and a full nail set that you see at the registrars  moving extra slow or at the customer service desk swapping selfies and checking Instagram. And there was alot of FRATERNIZING going on with fellow employees and some management it was like high school all over again and to top it off out HR couldn't keep his mouth closed about anything so there was no level of privacy besides that the company is a great non biased company that offers great benefits and career advancement its a fun company as well they always have a prize or contest going and they do alot for the community and city. Overall a great place to work had fun there would definitely go back if i had to !
good,"Lowe's was ok to work for, it's your typical retail job, always short staffed and working the job of 3 people, however, the pay was good and the benefits were decent."
good,"Turnover, month notice to take time off for appointments, boring at times; good training; scanned and bagged customers’ purchases by using Lowes’ computer system; took credit card payments; set up credit card accounts and assisted in all departments as needed."
good,"Maintaining internal, external and operational theft. Received continuous training. Working 60 hour weeks . Promoting safety through the store . Learned OSHA laws"
good,I worked for the distribution center for 4 months and it was ok.  The culture was laid back but the work got done on time.  I wish there would've been more room to move up within the company because I would've stayed there.
good,"a typical day at work will consist of helping customer finding their needs by assitting them by finding products or solutions or recomendations, I was fortunate to learn difference departments which help me have a better understanding of their business, I learned how to oversee departments in wood , garden,painting,and more. The harder thing to do was heavy lifting of products that weight more than 50 pounds. The Management was great they will keep us informed of products that were on special ,out of stock . We had meetings everyday at beginning of the day,"
good,"As long as you worked efficiently and accurately, everything was OK.  Guys who did not put in the effort did not last.  ten hour days 4 days a week was a plus."
good,"It has been a great place to work. The work/life balance is horrible. Great opportunities for those who want to work. Most positions do not require a degree, just experience."
good,Lowes is a good place to work for but there attendance needs to be across the board. Each facility had their own set up. It took 2 months to work off an occurrence at the Statesville DC. Other DC's only had 1 month to work off an occurrence
good,"Lowe's has been a great company to work for in the last 11 years. They offer benefits, stock. 401k and pay sick time. However there has been a lot of change and I'm not comfortable with my job security. I haven't had a raise in the last few years. Not even cost of living. With the rise in cost of living and health insurance my checks are less now then what they were 4 years ago. It's just time for me to look for change."
good,"Lowe's can be a great place to work if you get into an area that matches your interests. Seasonal jobs have 0 benefits except an employee discount. They will train you. The store I worked at had very high turnover in areas of labor(stockers, delivery, receiving,lumber,building materials). Make sure you are a safety conscious person because you can get hurt badly their, especially in areas stated above."
good,"I was with Lowes for 15 months."
good,"Lowes is an alright company to work with. My position was fairly straightforward, management was pleasant, and I've no major issues."
good,"unloading trucks  in timely manner with loading crew,, receiving product ,checked in all special orders.,shipping product in deliveries to customers and to other stores., working with people and helping each other. management was fair .everyone got along well great culture like big family.getting everything done that you planned to finish that day.the customer left feeling good about his experience."
good,"When I was hired, I was hired as seasonal, but they told me they would have a spot for me at the end of the season.  The end of the season came and I was let go.  I left a steady job to work at Lowe's and I was screwed over."
good,"I worked over nights and stocking the dept, I learned a lot about working at Lowes, the hardest job is not having the help when i needed it at times, the 401K was there when i needed it the most"
good,If you are looking for a part-time job with great pay this is the job for you don't expect too much benefits of great customer service also management is okay needs to be improved a lot more employees and management needs to see eye to eye to eye
good,"Lowes is not a bad company to work for as an overall statement. the issue is that there is often not enough oversight of the lack of integrity of (some) management at the corporate level. if you are in a good store from a management perspective it is a good place to work, if you are not, then not so much"
good,The atmospher was good the mamagement team new what they were doing. I enjoyed working there. I loved going to work everyday and I wanted to be there. I would go back.
good,"It's retail, working with the public is what you make it. Becoming fulltime can be difficult and outside of being in upper management the pay is not that great."
good,Lowes is a good job just poorly managed at the location i worked at. You have certain freedoms and your are able to work side by side with a team to help preform a majority of jobs.
good,"Overall a good place to work, however, it could be stressful at times and I don't feel I was compensated enough to deal with some of the stress that I experienced on a day to day level.  Did not staff enough employees to adequately handle the customers."
good,"Its alright, the management is all over the place and somedays you will never see a higher up but the next they will be breathing down your throat. Great work place if you are self motivated but would not recommend for someone who wants a career or to be appreciated."
good,Liked working there no opponents to advance Meet a lot of people have a lot of benefits enjoy customers help them to their car get good carts. Going to a lot of managers it’s very difficult to adjust
good,"typically my day at work starts the same other than the time of day i clock in and jump on a register to ring out costumers and answer questions. i learned a lot about people through this job. most of the time it's hard to hold a manager down for things you need because they are always so busy, the only hard part of my job is dealing with a large line of costumers. i enjoy the company of my coworkers while i'm on the floor."
good,doing a new store set up is exciting...however when I worked there they had Chinese overtime which was no very well paid. I was a key holder and got called in for emergencies over holidays when the management staff should of been the ones called.
good,"When I worked at Lowes I was a CSA in appliances. The work itself wasn't bad except the occasional annoying customer. The only thing that came between me and the Lowe's that I worked at was money. Lowe's refuses to offer overtime and my store would right you up if you had overtime and couldn't cut it. This was a large problem with me. Also Lowe's refused to increase my wage. Although I was told by management that I was a very valuable piece to the puzzle I was never treated that way. Lowe's never made me feel valuable. As an older employee told me, ""Lowe's is perfect for and older person that's looking for easy work and great benefits."" I warn young people to stay away from Lowes employment."
good,"The store managers were great. Department managers were kind of a different story. Some were very helpful, but others were just needlessly mean and rude."
good,"Fast paced at certain times, other times a little slow just depends on the season. Management very easy to get along with and try to meet your needs. People there are all very friendly and willing to help each other. Lifting things can be a problem sometimes. I enjoy the people I work with and helping people."
good,I learned a lot from working at Lowe's because all of the different contractors that came in there. I was also given the opportunity to work in different parts of the store allowing me to broaden my knowledge of different products and services.
good,Lowe's is a good place to gain healthy experience in the sales field.  You have a budget to meet but if you cannot it is not held against you because of the amount of other duties you have.
good,A great place to start your career. A good learning experience with a great work environment. The leadership in Management needs vast improvement. That where most of the struggles are.
good,"i learned about different products sold throughout the store and there purpose, Also how different products work in comparison with others."
good,"I would not recomend this to a working adult who has drive. It is the perfect setting for high school or college students, but no real future of success for anything past that outside of store management."
good,"Provide quick, responsive customer service."
good,"Always Learning! Loved to interact with the Patients! Loved going to work, loved the hours, and the overtime. Had to make some hard Choices. Terminally ill patients.Loved being in management and being a leader, I'm a great trainer and was always ready to step up to the challenge. I've always been asked to go into management to my employers have always seen my drive and leadership. I'm the person you can rely on, to get things done. Determined! I'm the last to leave if there is a task to be taken care of."
good,"Only retail place I'd rather work for is Costco. My experience really fluctuated depending on who the store manager was at the time. All in all it wasn't bad, wasn't amazing."
good,Lowes was unfair in terms of most of the employees that was stocking only had to work inside. They made work outside in the cold. They paid pretty good
good,Lowes is a decent company to learn how to operate power equipment and learn to problem solve quickly. It is also a good company to help jump start your future into a more promising career.
good,"I work in the outside garden center. Customer service is a priority greeting all customers. It's physically demanding at times loading gardening product ie; mulch, stone, brick, soil etc. which I like."
good,"I was an outside sales representative for Lowes. I would go to customers homes and sell them home improvement projects. I had daily reports as well as conference calls to discuss my selling's and findings in the field. The hardest part of the job was competing with bigger contractors. I enjoy people, and can sell them fairly on a good product."
good,Hours vary. Never a set schedule. Will go from 30 hours to 10 the next week. Compensation is fair. Vacation time is fairly built in with your hours. Holiday pay on certain holidays. Management is fair and transparent in most things.
good,Lowe's is a very best place to work. Okay pay and all around great employees to work with. Hours are okay If you are full time not if your part time. Management is okay to work around.
good,"Pretrip of truck and loads, deliver materials to customers, call customers to confirm deliveries assist customers finding correct materials or appliance.  Assist warehouse with loading and unloading trucks."
good,"everything you did was pointless and helping customers was a jok. everyone was a do for me kind of person "
good,"Great place to work, if you like hardware, wood, plants, stoves, refrigerators, doors.....home repair stuff. If you like that kind of stuff, rock on. It's cool for those reasons."
good,"There are many departments and areas inside Lowes.  One thing management will do, is cross train employees so everyone knows the basics of each department."
good,"customers are a pain to deal with in general, but when you have management out to get you and coworkers only caring about themselves, it just makes matters worse for you and the customer. the company itself is not a bad company to work for, its just the type of store I belong to that isn't the best"
good,Most of your time working here you'll be working really hard trying to complete worklists  or clean so you'll be busy your whole shift but when you get told to grab something from topstock or have to use the outdated computers it slows down your work process.
good,"Lowe's offers eligible part-time employees the following benefits: Part-time Medical Plans, Pharmacy Discount Card, Dental, Vision, Life Insurance, Short Term Disability, Critical Illness, Accident Insurance, Fixed Indemnity, Auto and Home Insurance, Vacation, Holiday, 401(k) Plan, and Employee Stock Purchase Plan."
good,"Working at this company was okay. The pay was decent, I enjoyed the fast paced work style, loading and helping the customers get what they need. However the management wasn't the best."
good,"So much two facing and petty gossip between cashing that sometimes I feel I am back in middle school.  I just got to work and do my eight hours, don't have time for drama.  HR dept could use a little more training, because they don't know what they are doing."
good,While the jobs within Lowe's involve a good attitude for customer service it also requires lots of nights and weekends.  Not exactly a good scenario for family work life balance
good,"Intensive work and labor, consistent and dire need to complete task within a certain time frame. Constantly down-stocking and breaking down new stock for the department"
good,Can be nice work environment. Management is not the most knowledgeable. Compensation is fair. This is a good place for young people or retired people to work. Talent evaluation is lacking along with good training for employees.
good,"Started off very easy, the training was not so strict, and perhaps could use some work. Try to keep a good work attitude/ethic is hard with so many negative/honest people around."
good,"If you enjoy talking to people this is the job for you. If you like helping customer's to solve their problems this is a good place to work, we had team meetings that were informational as well as fun.I worked with a great group of people."
good,"Very friendly work environment. Hours are steady, employees are amazing. Management is very friendly and very helpful. Benefits are good. I would definitely recommend this place for great part-time work."
good,"An excellent place to learn the home improvement business.  I provided software improvements to each individual store on a roll out basis.  Such things as card swipes, cash register screens, promotional programs, inventory and so on were provided for the stores."
good,"Hired originally for the nursery, I quickly excelled to learn multiple areas of the warehouse. I am very versatile. My experience includes flooring, paint, warehouse maintenance, cashiering, sales, scheduling work estimates and providing great customer service."
good,Enjoyable working with the staff and fast pace on certain days. Management was very helpful and respectful. It was a very safe place to work at and the staff got a long.
good,spend 80% of my time working on old beat up powered equipment. love the people i work with. Management leaves alot to be desired. pay isnt great but not bad for whats done on a daily basis.
good,"I started working at a Florida location and enjoyed the work and supervisors, but once I transferred to the Concord, NC store I started having problems.  Management and even HR will ignore concerns and requests.  Employees who work hard and are dedicated will have most of the work dumped off onto them, and be highly scrutinized while employees who do very little will continue to have that expected of them and were allowed to wonder away from their departments, play on non-work related websites on the computer, and allowed to use their phones for personal reasons while on the clock."
good,all they think about is money and talk about how they are here for us but don't do anything and if you are not in the group you don't get advancement ...
good,Lowe's is making efforts to adapt to the changing retail environment. It has provided a fair wage for the job performed. Good benefits and work life balance as improved over the years.
good,"Woking a Lowe's was okay. Not the best place to work. Sometimes long hours, lots of standing. Customers can become annoying after a while, but that's retail"
good,"Worked in lawn and garden, had to work with people who did their work half way, didn't care how things were done, they would skip important details and worked around the rules. Had to train a couple girls who were discussing their pay and they were paid more than me and they were job shadowing me. Their were a few good/committed team players who made my time there a lil pleasant."
good,Enjoyed working there in the beginning.
good,"To be honest, I really did not want to be in retail again, but overall, my co-workers were basically nice people and fair to work with. I was  not impressed with the in-store management team, there was a lot of partiality for certain Associates with certain members of Management. "
good,No respect for women and minorities. The store manager was a micro managing jerk with no social skills. The inventory was like a never ending scavenger hunt from he11.  We never had enough associates on the clock to maintain the standards and cleanliness expected of us which led to alot of unfair right ups and blame which trickle down the chain of command.
good,"In my year of working at Lowes Foods I discovered many pros and many cons. I actually enjoyed working at Lowes for the most part, but their are some silly marketing techniques that I even noticed the customers getting sick of. Almost all the people I met from corporate were jerks, so be prepared to kiss butt if they come in. All the staff has changed since I worked there, but it can be a good job if you make it one."
good,"I was an employee at Lowe's and it is an average job. It is as average as any sales associate position can be. IT is an average on floor job, not great but not bad."
good,"This is a customer focused organization. Associates are generally friendly and outgoing. Management is spread thin and needs to be better trained. Product knowledge empowers associates to increase sales, but staff turnover makes this difficult to achieve. Dedication to customers and results is respected by management, but not rewarded by the company. Accountability and results are managed primarily through documenting poor behavior as opposed to effective positive rewards. As a retail company, I rank Lowe's better than most with regard to employee's."
good,Work environment was fast paced. Learned useful customer service and facility maintenance skills. Management was present. Coworkers were diverse and a pleasure to work with.
good,"lowes is a great company to work for, especially if you're just looking for something part time while in college or retired and want to do something to keep you busy."
good,It's an good place to work if you like working with the public. Customer for the most part are friendly. It is nice to feel like you have helped someone with a problem.
good,"The job itself as well as my peers were great, we operated in perfect cohesion like a big machine. Unfortunately our sales team constantly promised things we couldn't do, such as rearranging their homes for them."
good,Well it was very hard work but fun. I work there as a temp. I did not get the job. i was let go at end of my contract. The people there was nice so were the supervisor.
good,they need a better system for the bounce system i did not liked the way they ran the scoring system they did not  score you well at all they always make it look good
good,Good place to work and learn.  Working with customers was great and I got along with everyone there.  Management was good to work with and discount was nice.
good,A lot of lifting and driving a forklift. I was the only pit driver in the store.Learned to manage people and solve their problems.Manager was sometimes good.Work culture up and down.Hardest part was working when the pits were broke down. We just had to work hard our boss did not allow any enjoyment.
good,Ok place to work. Timely schedule and consistent. Unorganized at times with no real guidance except that current jobs must be completed by the end of the day.
good,"Not enough associates on the floor to cover volume of customers in store, what happens then is the associates there are required to leave their departments and cover the areas not covered"
good,"Part time job in college. Low pay, low hours, and poor training. You are expected to be an expert in your department with no real training or guidance."
good,"Good employer with great stock ownership potential. Competes with Home Depot on all aspects, merchandise, customer service and pricing. Enjoyed my years with Lowe's."
good,Working for lowes was ok but there is a lack of acountability a lot of poeple get away with things that they should be held accountable for and it is hard to get someone written up
good,"In 2016 Lowe's administered a major company wide Management restructuring that eliminated a Thousands of management positions, and pushed out a lot of great people.  The culture and quality of associates have suffered greatly due to these moves, I loved my job for quite a few years, but when I left the only thing I missed was the way it used to be and the  great people."
good,"If you want a position or to move up, you have to talk to seemingly everyone but still might not get it. it is great for full time, as an in between for school and the upper positions, but if you want to move from part time up its very difficult. It is a very on your feet job so wear something comfortable!"
good,"A typical day at work involves helping customers, and helping management with other tasks as assigned. At this particular location, management wasn't really concerned with employee happiness."
good,"Overall, not a bad experience. Enjoyed working here. Met and worked with a lot of nice, smart people, who always were willing to help you with projects that needed done."
good,"Lowes is definitely a good company to work for if you need seasonal work. It can turn out to be a regular job, but mostly seasonal is what they hire. Good company."
good,Lowes is a fast pace environment and I enjoyed working with the customers the most.  Management was less than professional and needed someone that could be a leader.
good,"If a corporate culture is what you want, Lowe's is a great place to work. While the individual workers are usually good, the overall management structure only cares about the bottom line and beating profit expectations."
good,Head cashiers micromanage the cashiers way too much. You have to call them once you get to the break room so they can time your break. The job also requires a lot of standing. Pay is reasonable.
good,"No real complaints here other than the fact that you could spend 10 yrs there before ever making $20 per hr. If you have the time and money set aside to float a carrer at Lowe's. Than it may be the job for you. Im nowhere near ready to retire, and can not work for minimum wage."
good,"always a skeletal crew.  seemed like the older empoyees were the ones who always showed up to work and worked. and didnt call off. "
good,"Wasn't bad for a seasonal job but it's been so long that I don't really remember much about it.  If you work outside, use sunscreen.  Sunburn isn't enjoyable."
good,I would say working at Lowe's is a good transitional job for someone who is pursuing a career or going to school. Lowe's also offers a great opportunity to learn important job skills and is a good stepping stone.
good,I delivered whatever customers ordered and installed.Also did some re-sets of stores. Then went to work in tools and hardware to assist in selling tools and hardware to customers.
good,"working with others,learning different things,a great work place,i like the people i worked with ,love the breaks and time work there,and loving about the industrial place"
good,It was a good place to work with good health benefits. I enjoyed the people I worked with and getting to drive power equipment every night.............
good,learn about building and making things. good place to work and has good benefits. A place that carries everything you need..............................
good,Went to work dealing with customers and that was the best part of the job.  I had a great customer base and they would email me with their needs and I would find whatever they may need.
good,Lowes was self paced and they were all about safty. Good place to work if you like the hrs. Many positions in the building. All about teaching u new things and again teach you how to be safe as possible
good,"Delivery driver (2nd job, part time work 2002- 2002)"
good,Lowe's can be alot of fun but you have to be part of the good old boys club which at times made it hard to work for them. Other then that it was a good place to work
good,"I learned a lot, there is a lot of opportunities for advancement although I had experienced several situations where favoritism took the main roll in advancements. I have seen where management already knew who they were putting into the roll before interviews had even taken place including external hires that were told to apply. It is a great company to work for if you get into the right store with the right management team. It is sad to say that a lot of the stores are nothing more than another day in middle school where people are talking poorly about each other including the management team. The medical benefits are available but not the best but they do have a lot of perks in other benefits. some stores are very great to work in like I stated above and have very upbeat and supportive atmospheres while other stores you feel as though it is cutthroat. They do pay well most of the time."
good,Fast paced call center environment. Job can be stressful due to anything can come through your phone and customers yell at you. Have to think out of the box for your job
good,The job was not bad. Drove around delivering appliances to customers. The employees were nice to work with and was always willing to help others if you asked for it.
good,Lowes was an average company to work for.  I would load and unload orders within the store.  I would interact with customers and assist them with finding products.
good,"no comment at this time,  I have nothing to say at this time but wil input feedback at a different time, lots to say good and bad, but overall ok. thanks."
good,"I only worked there so I can get my degree. The hours are pretty bad and it’s a pain to try and have a solid set schedule. My manager is amazing to work with but I can’t say much for the other managers. It’s probably a lot worse. Pay sucks but helps you get by. During the busy season (spring early summer) it gets very stressful with the amount of people coming through but overtime helps pay the bills. The weather  can be annoying if it’s really cold or really hot. Job security is really nice though, you have to really mess up to get fired."
good,All around this was a great place to work management was understanding and supportive of their staff. they have a greak 401K and health benefits. I would recommend this job to others
good,"I would not recommend Lowes to anyone who wants to make any money. If you are seasonal its a good job to work temporary. As a regular employee you will not get very good hours or pay,    They will not give you very many hours at all and for the pay its not worth it.    If you are willing to have unknown set hours and no pay raises for anyone but management, its a great place to work."
good,Great benefits if you are a long time employee. But the full time positions are very few. It is great for a part time or seasonal job. I would stay if they offered overtime.
good,Appreciate the opportunity I had at Lowe's. Allowed me to interact more with the public. Ability to exercise my management and training skills with staff.
good,Lowes was an okay job it wasnt that good the managers were very poor they never helped if you needed help and the hours were poor so i do not recommend it to anyone
good,"Typical workday is usually quick paced with just enough of a challenge to keep me on my toes."
good,"Work environment is fast paced and energetic. Typical day would include receiving new merchandise, maintaining clean and safe areas for customers, reset product in more fluent space locations for customer ease."
good,"One day you’ll open, 6am, off around 4pm, and the close next night, come in around 1pm, off around 11pm.  That sounds good, except 3rd day...you open again!  "
good,Each day you were faced with something new and exciting. The customer experience was great but you needed to be customer orientated to work in some areas.
good,Very friendly place of employment well trained employees as well as managers. daily routines was to make sure shelves were stock properly and sales of special orders to increase sales.
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowe's. They are friendly, and compassionate. Very knowledgeable with hard workers who have fun in the process. I would still be working there if I stayed in Texas."
good,"Helping customers solve there problems. Give them the parts and tools to accomplish their task. If they need items form other departments, help them or link them up with the customer service person to resume help. Always make sure they have an answer to all there questions. We are the pro's and we make it happen."
good,good place to work at the time - turn over is quiet extensive - upper management needs improvement - that is all  that is going to be said ******************
good,Not a bad place to work . the people are not bad but they like to gossip a lot. the mangers are not bad people as long as you do what you re their to do
good,I really don't remember much about there except every ones I know don't work there anymore I hopefully they have more associate on the floor and they know more information
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work for people entering into the workforce."
good,it was good place to work learned alot liked dealing with puplic liked my co workers learned fortlift pluming hardwere many departments within the store
good,"Very fast paced,which you get used to. Co workers are friendly and helpful. Opportunity to cross train in other departments. Open door policy. Lots of employee appreciation events throughout the year."
good,Working at Lowe's will teach you patience and test it daily. There are many opportunities to learn about the retail industry in this big box store. Managers are often mentors to staff. You will need to work as a team often and depend heavily on communication to ensure the customers get their product and leaves the store happy.
good,I Was Only A Lowe’s For A Short Time As A Cashier. The Work Was Fast Past But Easy. They Had Old modeled cash registers that was Easy to operate. Management was nice
good,I really enjoyed myself at lowes. the manager was awesome and laid back and the work wasn't stressful at all. pay was good bi-weekly and the people were nice
good,Great place to start working with all the different departments. Learning all the in's and out that have to deal with homes and their owners. creating new designs for them to look at and make a decision.
good,"Delivery occasionally involves long hours. Invariably, you're dealing with stupid customers on a daily basis. Once you're in delivery, you have no opportunity for advancement. If there is a redeeming point of the job, it is steady employment."
good,"Lowe's was a fun job for me because I enjoyed the customers and being in the design department; however, the hours that were given were no enough to sustain me or my children."
good,no respect for employees they are getting rid of alot of the seasoned employees and replacing them with part timers there is no job security in that place
good,I worked at Lowe's for 6 years. During that time management consistently overlooked my needs. They did sometimes required that I work overtime to make deliveries.
good,"Did not care for the sales floor. Too many flexible hours that prohibited you from having a ""normal"" life outside the workplace, unable to meet with friends and family often. The hardest part of the job was not enough training for certain departments"
good,"I knew switching to retail would be difficult but I didn't realize the variance of hours/days. Sometimes you work six days straight. Could close one day & open the next. Just not a great schedule for work/life balance which I have always worked hard to achieve."
good,very good company to work for they where team players they and always willing to help where ever they could. management was awesome i had no issues therw i left foe a better job that i was trained in the field for
good,"They have a very laid back attendance policy but not well organized for advancement opportunities. Several head management changes and no one is on the same page or seems to care. If you are there just to work and get paid, great place to work. If you have any desire to promote...fat chance. They do not believe in their own ""promotion program"" in the slightest and have no intention of fixing the problem. That would involve talking to people and no longer pushing the issue off to the next person to prevent blame on management. Great for someone needing money and gaining experience in the distribution industry."
good,"Not a bad place to work, people are friendly, there is room for advancement, but the pay is minimum and slightly above. There is a lot of cronyism between friends and it is difficult to get into an area that you really want."
good,"The management is evil. The only look out for themselves. The employees are so sweet. Some can be racist but 70% of them are awesome. The pay and benefits are cool, but the management will kick you in your behind and act like they didn't do it."
good,"Nice people, but very competitive. It was a stressful work place. but working around the plants was fun. Visible tattoos and piercings are allowed. It's over all a nice job just a little rocky."
good,I am on first shift and it is a pretty laid back job. I’m not trained on equipment so it makes recieving much harder. The break times are very lenient as long as your performance is good.
good,"was a good place to work, fast paced and good people to work with. customers are a pain sometime but it is retail and that comes with the territory. Management was iffy. Sometimes good sometimes bad"
good,I do customer service by helping customers find mechanize.  I do refunds and returns.  I work as a cashier in all departments. I do money transactions.
good,"Working at lowes as a loader gave a good feel of freedom, not being restricted to one place and wading through the day did nkt feel as bad as when stuck behind tge register."
good,Had a good time helping people that knew very little about the DIY with the projects they were going to start. The kids Sat projects were fun. Training was good when I was there.
good,"I only worked there for 3 months during the spring for the nursery section, so I cant really review the company much beyond saying that at this location the management wasnt terrible, and let you do what you needed to most of the time. do be prepared to work in inclement weather though."
good,Great culture and great people to work with.  Great leaders and being able to mold and grow in advancement .  You have the ability to move up in the company
good,The store manager is nice and professional . As far as department managers they could use some training in professionalism in keeping things about employees confidential.
good,"besides all the politics, a great place to work. Most of the people that work at lowes are great. they are willing to help and teach if need be. the customers are great."
good,there was a huge cooperate change there are no longer dept managers in any dept which was the worst move in any business i been in over 40 yrs. Customers starting complaining that service got worst than ever ext.
good,Money was very good but the safety was a big concern for me in my department.  Little care was shown for the equipment that we used and the vehicles we were expected to use for delivery.  Had to argue and fight with management to address my concerns with these issues and often it went ignored or was pushed off till later or never.
good,management awful good pay. get in and get out unless you want to joint the management program which offers lackluster results and feedback.  pays better than depot
good,i was my first warehouse job but i learned a lot even though i was seasonal i enjoyed working there they have a great team their associates are awesome and hard working and they got a great hr team and great management.
good,"Quality of the jobs offered at LOWES really depend on the region that you apply in. In most cases, you find it to be a decent place to work with management that cares and a work schedule that is for the most part flexible. If you are looking for a livable wage with LOWES, look at the management positions, otherwise you will not make enough to support yourself or a family."
good,Managers are friendly and the work environment is pretty upbeat and enjoyable. Everyone seems to want to help out and make your day the best it can possibly be.
good,"I liked this job, we worked about 12-hour shifts with breaks and got a 10 percent discount. As a cashier, we stayed at our register. It was well paced most of the time except on holidays. On holidays it was very busy and the lines were long and it became very fast paced. The management worked well with you and your schedule."
good,"I am a cashier, which makes me the last point of contact with all customers. There are a lot of complaints from customers that they couldn't find anyone on the sales floor to help them. I find it difficult to reach employees on the sales floor to help customers as well. It is also difficult to find help to load customers merchandise after a sale. It is not an unwillingness to work from sales floor staff, but rather the store is always understaffed. "
good,"I enjoyed working with the staff at this job, however contracting work can be stressful and the hours are not consistent based on weather stipulations."
good,"There are a lot of politics with working at Lowe's, if you are good at that, then you will fit in. I don't like how management cuts part timers hours down to 10 hours a week, work full timers very hard and all in the name of ANNUAL BONUS! Now part timers must use other means to pay bills through the holidays. Sad. They look over hard workers and hire outsiders who often times don't stay after getting a taste of Lowe's culture. Management expect so much and do so little to help out."
good,"The working hours and the benefits were not the greatest, but overall it was a enjoyable place to work. The management and the employees are nice to work with."
good,"I would recommend this job for a teenager still living with parents, or perhaps if your significant other is the main provider of the home. The pay is not enough to cover basic bills and get by. The hours are sporadic (although for retail, that's not surprising). The management is fair but firm and the workload is usually realistic. My advise to Lowe's would be this: Focus more hours and better pay on a select few employees to keep them sticking around longer. Paying low and giving out too few hours is a recipe for a high turnover rate."
good,"Busy work environment "
good,"Lowes recognized my work ethic and allowed me to grow up to the capacity that the store could shoulder, once beyond that I had to look elsewhere for employment. Decent job."
good,"I enjoy the work and all. Fast pace but then you get slow moments. My hours are very inconstant, and pay isn't all that. The managers and people are cool to work with."
good,This was a good place to start in retail and learn the business.  Advancement is limited and management talents and abilities vary greatly and have a direct impact on job satisfaction and advancement.
good,Depending on the department you work in and the day of the week it can be a very fast paced environment but the harder you work the best chance you have of moving up in the company they really do like to promote from with in
good,a learning experience of knowing how to install appliances even though I knew of how to do it. It was just fine tuning it and teaching the younger ones on how to do it.
good,"Early morning set up in paint department. Made great contacts with paint contractors and a lot of sales. Enjoyed working with the public,creating and understanding their projects."
good,I worked at the distribution center and the employees did a good job at helping one another get the job done for the day. Even if it wasn't there specific job duty.
good,"Hours are flexible and great staff and customers that come back time and time again"
good,Lowes made many changes this year that is not going in the right direction for me. It used to be a great place to work. I am only staying because it is close to my home.
good,"the staff was friendly and very easy to get along with. customers were friendly. "
good,great place to work. its really relaxed and a great team. Most work together and some like to work alone. Benefit packet is good and the customers there are awesome.
good,Productive and steady work flow. There is always something to do. Helping and assisting customers I learned a lot about customer service. The hardest part of the job was when there was unsatisfied customer no matter what you tried to do the customers just wasn't satisfied.. Also when customer would come and try to steal merchandise.
good,"When being a delivery person you will work entirely too hard for not enough money. They expect you to perform miracles to get the appliances inside the customers residence. They will overload the deliveries and make you work 10-12 hours a day, then complain when you get overtime."
good,On a typical busy day you may not get a break but you will definitely get a lunch. For those who work 5 hours or less they might not get a break on a very busy day.
good,It an easy retail job. Just stock the shelves and talk to customers. You'll learn a lot about the products you're surrounded by. It's pretty fun for the most part.
good,I was a head cashier and was a manager role to all the cashiers.  I had to tell them when to go to lunch and take breaks.  Being a head cashier you had a lot of responsibilities.
good,Pay keeps you at the low income tax bracket. Insurance needs to be improved. Family-like work environment is it's only redeeming quality. Hard to move up within company
good,Great working with people i work with but there is no advance in jobs from part-time to full they would rather hire a retired person or a vet thats 60+ for a physical fast paced job then a younge person and cant keep people do too unload because no hours and the hours of operation.
good,Overall great employees just poor management and scheduling at times. Poor communication. But veteran employees often showed me the ropes. It was a great experience overall.
good,"strip and condense of flowers and plants"
good,"Working as a cashier and at the customer service desk you try to make the customer's shopping experience the best it could be. Gaining knowledge in building, plumbing and electrical and what specific tools are needed for a specific use."
good,Lowes was an overall rather easy job with good pay at the entry level position. The hardest part of the job was closing in lumber. Having to restack all the piles of wood took almost 2 hours after close every night.
good,There was a  lot of nice customers. It was pretty mellow. The co workers I had  were  ok. The store was overall taken care of. There was plenty of work experiences you can learn from.
good,My salary is based off of a 40 hour work week with 50 hours minimum scheduled. My shifts are 11 hours long. Advancement is slow. Health insurance plans offered.
good,Decent rate of pay typical retail environment had fun with other associates learned to run a forklift poor management hence why the company is struggling to keep managers employed.
good,good well placed work and stress free work zone Good training nice people learned about hardware paints good management and workplace culture would work their again
good,"Great Place to Work, just some people ruin it along with management, A lot of favoritism and not enough staff at times. Personally had some staff hold me back from apply to full time position so I would stay in one department"
good,"I enjoyed being a customer service employee, and a returns employee.  I enjoyed helping where ever I was needed.  I originally worked full time but was over looked for many advancing jobs so I got a another job with advancement opportunities."
good,"Customer enter action, lead generation, sales, learned 20/20 software, hight turnover, covering multiple department due to under staffing, assisting Customers with their kitchen and bathroom Design."
good,Wiel it is fast passed as it goes closer to mid week it gets slower. Sometimes huge guys will ask smaller people to load their cars. Sometimes forklift operator wont listen to spotter. And customers don't listen to workers if barriers are up.
good,"I was a seasonal employee, Hours were all over the place. You could be working late one night and then come in next day early morning. "
good,Learned a lot here received my forklift training here and learned their receiving system was able to help open another store. Helped set up and open the store I worked in
good,"Left due to lack of hours.  Not really sure what else to say.  Not a bad company, but working as a cashier was toxic at times, as was some of the attitudes coming from some of the men working manual labor positions."
good,Lowes was a stepping stone job that will not lead you very far in the end. It is a job and nothing more. management is not very good and the pay was very low.
good,Typical day is trying to finish multiple task while helping associates with day to day issues. Hardest part of the job is the consistent changes in policy and proceses
good,"Needs more employees for the job. Employee's that work at Lowe's 40 hours a week stand all day everyday with little assistance for customers entering more than one department. Mornings are crucial, and lack of management decisions."
good,The people I worked with go above and beyond to help you out. I stocked the shelve and used heavy equipment to do so. It was fun going to work. We did get incredibly busy at times.
good,"Typical day consists on helping customers, ensuring company objectives are worked and met, as well as stocking product onto shelves. Handle money periodically throughout day during busy hours, as well as execute management tactics as requested."
good,This is a warehouse and as such the work is hard. There can be mandatory overtime and you are often exposed to extreme temps. However the compensation makes it worth it.
good,"When working for Lowes as a whole, The company would appear not bad and a good career path but would depend on the store and who you ask that works with the company. The stores structure would depend on the correct management and work place to succeed in sales and productivity"
good,"Too many chiefs and not enough indians!"
good,"Responsible for providing quick, friendly customer service by answering customers questions, providing purchase assistance in selection, demonstration, and purchase of product including special orders and installations. Keep shelves fully stocked and fronted according to planogram and correctly priced."
good,"The job never allows you to be standing still or bored, which in my opinion I love. There are times when the management do not work as hard as the workers which cause the store to go in a downward spiral of misfunction."
good,"Typical retail environment. Expect ignorant customers and to be forced to learn other departments. While it is good to learn more they take advantage of this far too much for it to be fair for the employee. I did, however, learn a good deal about how my products work and how to work around a certain issue. My direct Supervisor was fair to me but the close-open shifts are unnecessary so be ready for that. People, from my experience, enjoy drama and gossip far too much so keep to yourself about anything personal but don't let that stop you from making a  work buddy or two. There were times when the store was slow and I  enjoyed that as it gave me time to recollect my thoughts and tidy up my department more. The hardest part of the job was honestly working up the will to deal with rude customers who simply didn't understand that as a worker you don't decide why some things don't work out in their favor."
good,This job was very chaotic when referring to their management. We could leave when we wanted and could not take a lunch break. Some days we were required to work other sections in the store to make up for lack of employees. Just looking for a different job that will teach me and help me grow as a person and an employee.
good,When it was busy it was busy Lowe's was a good place to work at. When it became slow there was not much to do. I liked being at the service desk more than I liked being on the register. I was more comfortable and better at the service desk.
good,I've enjoyed for the most part working at Lowe's it is a nice plays to work but can be challenging at times. I have come back but realized after working here for 6 mths that this may not be for me anymore.
good,"This has been a very good overall experience.  I have worked for two different store locations in 9 years.  I have had 5 different store managers, all with different approaches to management."
good,helping costomers. bout different items and what they are for.frendly and helpful managers.people from all back grounds.keeping track of all the items in my departments. helping costomers.
good,I began at lowes right after it was built. Was able to help build the inside and set up the beams before stocking merchandise for the grand opening. A lot of great non experienced people.
good,I enjoyed my time at Lowes. It was the most nice just being able to help customers out with their needs. Specifically in the flooring department. It was fun helping customers plan out their visions.
good,Current leadership have made decisions for 2016/17 have been incredibly lacking and the company has lost its focus that I had loved for the previous 9 years.
good,"Lowe's is generally a good place to work, it has declined somewhat in recent years.  They did away with the department manager position, which makes upward movement within the company much more difficult, and has created a slightly chaotic atmosphere. They are also gradually moving away from a mostly full time crew to part time.  On a positive note, the pay is better than most retail companies, and the benefits are good.  Vacation times are pretty generous, though after 12 years of working there,  burnout can be a real problem, to the point of a week off here and there doesn't help."
good,"loved the people, didn't not like the management team nor the store manager. They think too much about themselves and not the employees."
good,I would stay at Lowes if I had full time hours and benefits.  I like working with the public and I am capable of multi-tasking in a fast pace work environment.
good,"Lowe's is a decent place to work for the area. I learned how to drive a forklift, pick and load trailers. The management team is ok, they are willing to work with you the best they can."
good,It was a job were no matter how hard you worked it didn't pay off not much potential growth. Management would get fired often and it seemed the store was always understaffed.
good,would not like to review the company at this time. Do not feel my opinion of company is important at this time.....................................................
good,Hard work when working on the trucks due to lack of training for new employees. Low pay for hard labor jobs makes you not want to work here for very long.
good,"Handle all money coming in and going out of building. In charge of Customer service desk, cashiers, and cash vault. Make sure all special were picked up and signed for."
good,It's a good place to work as a side job or part time. Overall great people to work with. Once you get in to management the demand doesn't match with the pay.
good,"clock  in , head  to  a  register , attend  customers , sack , clean  your  "
good,"Must be good at customer service.  Lots of interaction with customers.  Lower level management is great.  Lots of lifting, stocking, ladders, etc.  I broke my ankle and can't do a lot of the physical requirements anymore."
good,"Not the best place to work money wise, but it was enjoyable to work outside and learn about the plants in the inventory. I would suggest this job for college students attempting to make a buck."
good,"Wasn't the best of experiences, no trouble stepping up to the plate only to have others lean on that. Department manager was great not so much the store manager."
good,"This company has poor upper management, at times it can be frustrating.  But it is fast paced and the direction management was going was always changing."
good,"Although I found it fun to work there, the store itself had problems with dating within each department.  I liked that we could get our 10%discount and pay for it right there."
good,"8 hour shift, good place to work. they arent very leniant with school though and thats an issue. They dont understand that school is a job itsself and you have to put school first."
good,The only thing about Low's is that we had to work the overnight shift. Some nights it was hard to stay awake and really focus on your job if you did not get the proper rest.
good,I have nothing to say about the store that I'm working at> The mng At this Lowes is not concerned with the employees. All he looks at in how mush the store can make so he can get that big bonus.
good,The hardest part about the job is the ever changing hours and the amount of heavy lifting that is involved.  The most enjoyable part about working here is the employees are great.
good,Loved the customers but it was very competitive and cut throat. One giant gossip building. Management  constantly changing and not always for the best. I think many people would enjoy this job if they are not stuck at a register.
good,I love what I do but I need to get paid for more what i do as sales specialist and work other dept not enough recognition.  Needs more better trained staff employees
good,Drive sales by providing excellent customer service.  Very customer-centric sales environment.  Must be flexible to work hours needed which makes sense since it is a big box retailer with daily and seasonal fluctuations in business.
good,I enjoyed what I did and the people I worked around. The customers were great. Lowes has a lot of benefits for full time employees. Invest in the stock program.
good,Was ok when first started everyone was nice and friendly. When management changed everyone was treated like an inmate . You will easily loose hours if you have to leave for family emergencies
good,"As a repairs agent you take calls from customers about their appliances. A typical call is about how their appliance (washer, dryer, fridge, stove) is broken. They either need us to schedule service or troubleshoot. Sometimes they are new appliances and/ or have a warranty. Many time the customer does not have a warranty or it has expired. Customer then has to pay out of pocket to get appliance serviced. A few customers get very angry and are rude. Takes lots of patience and empathy. Customer takes out frustration on service agent. Must have good personality and not let angry customers get to you."
good,"Depending on the floor you work on, it can change your work style. upper floors are typically more agile and quick paced work and other floors are more of the quiet cubicle setting."
good,"Working at Lowes employees learn time management skills, prioritization, delegation, and working in a team environment. "
good,You meet a lot of nice people and do some challenging work. Its very intense at times in order to achieve the sales goal for the year. Its a great place to work.
good,hours can get long some days  pretty good team for the most part. lots of opertunity to cros train in different areas of the store. Training is availible from sister stores
good,difficult with all cuts being made. Often times salaried mgrs would be running a dept due to staff cuts. Also PT's were getting only 10 hrs a week which would often cause lots of turnover
good,I used to love working at Lowes. Lately there have been a lot of restructuring of our management team. These changes have not helped our store. They have lowered the moral and frankly the store is an utter mess.
good,"Relaxed and fun place to work, but managers aren’t always the greatest and don’t always offer you enough help. We are always short people on unloading the truck and they tell us that help is short when there’s plenty of people"
good,"Very busy work days managing multiple people and areas. Money handling, opening and closing store procedures. Problem solving and counseling to employees and customers."
good,every day i had to make sure what installers were going and pull product for them .I paid bill that the installers sent in . Filled paper work . Called customer making sure every thing with the install went good. Ordered product for customers.Wrote work orders for the customers problems.Handled all aspects of the install .
good,You never know what kind of work environment you will have from day to day. Management changes quickly. They are pretty good to their employees from and HR perspective.
good,"Lots of lifting, stocking, tagging, loading. Pay was not commensurate with experience and duties. As with many sales positions, commissions have been replaced with salary and weekly dollar sales quota which does affect customer service"
good,"haven't been here long enough to really give an accurate review. the job HR said was available is not the hours the scheduling manager is scheduling me for. they re not very good trainers, I learned more from videos than the employees"
good,"I currently work at Lowes Food for one year. I don't mind the work and the rotating shifts. My coworkers are fun and my managers are fine. I am looking for stability, full time and hopefully and opportunity to obtain medical benefits."
good,Primary job responsibilities make sure we have the proper inventory stock for customers. Aid customers in determining what they needed to complete the projects they were working on.
good,"The benefits are great as well as the compensation. Local management lacks lacks ability to fully utilize employee's strengths and skills to improve the overall business; favoritism is a big driver in advancement for employees. If you are not part of the core group in the store, you will be looked over in almost every aspect of daily operations including opportunities to further yourself."
good,Pretty laid back place to work depending on the department that you are working in. During the spring and summer seasons is when business is booming during the winter months hours are cut due to lack of business.
good,I learned a lot about DIY and that Lowe's is community-minded and they also help the individual when they are able.  Mostly everyone is helpful and willing to help each other out.
good,"good place to start, and you have to meet new people everyday, and learned new thing in the store."
good,Coworkers were personable as well as the manager. A typical day included checking all areas were properly opened up to customers. Blocking aisles when using equipment to get items from the tops of the shelves. entering customer info into the computers and grabbing items from the back room that were pre ordered.
good,"Although the pay is well, I did not like that Lowe's Co. is a seasonal store. After the summer hours and pay is cut severely. I officially started March 2015 and it was decent, but once May came it was time for me to leave."
good,i work without out the majority of supervisors looking over my shoulder. the hours could be better. still some favoritism when trying to move to different positions in the company
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and the other employees. I love the work as a Kitchen Designer and providing excellent customer service to customers that will enjoy their Kitchen for years to come.
good,"I was hired as a supervisor of 2 departments within three I was given Two more departments . I handled it to the best of my ability . I had lots to learn , but they were not patient  ,they kept pushing. I surprised them all . I learned and took pride in what I did, and kelp learning."
good,"Lowes was an overall good place to work.  I was currently in a fulltime program at St. Clair college and working an average of 30 hours a week.  It was tough to make both work, however I managed and performed very will in both school and work.  I was a peak employee which had no job security, room for advancement, benefits or much room to grow as a fulltime student."
good,Very busy get an hour linch break kinda a easy going after ypu get the hang of it you receive nice pay an great benefits. The co workers are very nice the management very poor
good,"when i was there i loved working overnight, my manager was really great. they ended up laying off over 5000 employees after i had left. They got rid of a lot of great people that I knew there and they hired a bunch of kids who know nothing about the department they are in."
good,"Lowe's is good to work for if you are at the corporate level.  Working at the store level is very past face, stressful and if you are lucky end up with a good manager.  You need good walking shoes."
good,Lowe's was good work.  I was promoted fairly quickly but decided to change companies due to better benefits and better wage.  I did liked working there and learned alot.
good,"love the job, just has really dropped over the last 2 years with all the changes. Lot of pressure to sale and not a lot of support and training. Benefits cost keep rising without pay increases to cover."
good,"A lot of the regular customers were very rude because they knew management would give them whatever they want if they caused enough of a scene. Management did not take care of problems within the store very well. There were several cases of harassment that were not handled. They did not do anything about employees who several employees AND customers had problems with and always had to fix mistakes for. Advancement opportunities were based on how well you answer questions instead of how well they know you work. They trained you well in the department you were placed in but if you wanted to expand to others they kind of left you to ask other people and learn on your own. They did have some good trainings and lots of very good, friendly employees. It was overall a good company to work for and I learned a lot and would absolutely work for another Lowe's but I will never go back the one in Ashtabula."
good,"delivery team is expected to work until all deliveries are complete, regardless of amount of hours worked or time of day it is . back breaking work especially for an older person."
good,"overall pretty good position,however through the years became more stressfull with added responsibilitys, and no salary increase.,rewarding with seeing finished product."
good,they started too cut hours so you wouldn't get 40hours.. they took special orders away from us so that you couldn't make extra money. Co workers where great. We worked as a team
good,I loved the job. They worked around my CNA classes I was taking a that time..I had to leave for personal reasons. I would still work there if I could.
good,"As a delivery driver you are overworked and compensated for the workload you have to complete in an 8 hour day. At times when completed the daily route, it was difficult to get ahold of management to process returns."
good,"The work environment is with hardware, tools, paint, plumbing, home repair items and lumber. Working with customers to satisfy their needs in these areas. With emphasis on customer satisfaction."
good,"Good place to work, you'll learn a lot and make friends. Work hard, don't become the yes man bc everyone will come to you and ask for EVERYTHING.  you'll be fine."
good,Lowes is an environment for self starters. They allow you to do your job without micro managing you and expect for you tube pro active. Lowes feels like a family and is inclusive.
good,While working at Lowes I came to know a lot friendly people who enjoy coming to work. But I believe that their leadership team needed better training on how treat their employees.
good,busy days are very hectic with back to back calls and MOD asking questions all the time but it is a good job for someone who isn't phased by customers getting upset at them over random things
good,I worked there in college. Its a pretty cool job if you need some extra cash. I worked in outside lawn and garden. Don't apply for that position if you don't plan on working.
good,Working at lowes has its ups and downs. The employees and management are fun and easy to work with...the customers not so much. Overall a pretty good place to work.
good,It has been quite a long time since I worked at Lowe's but again I liked dealing with people. It was only part time so I moved on to Sherwin-Williams.
good,"Like the summary says, it's Lowes.  A good place to work for a while, over the summer or during winter months.  Maybe for a year or two, but beyond that, it's time to move on."
good,"The hours for any retail job are somewhat undesirable.  That being said, Lowes is not that bad of a place to work.  Pretty decent pay and benefits. You also get to pick stuff up on the cheap!"
good,"Helped customers with home improvement projects. Downstocked inventory to fill shelves. Cycle counts and necessary. Certified on forklift, reach truck and order picker"
good,"I answered all the questions pertaining to Lowes Foods not Lowes Hardware.  Hope this does not interfere with my employment opportunities.  Lowes foods was a very good place to start working as a young teenager, but now that I am out of school, I wish to pursue a career."
good,"Lowes is a good starter job and stable, but if you want to advance or move up in the world, you need to go somewhere else after a while.  The pay is not that desirable or high enough to live comfortably on your own."
good,This is a decent job. It teaches teamwork and the ability of leading a crew. I would recommend someone to look into applying at this location for a job.
good,Most of the people I worked with were great. Most managers were good but upper management at store level not so much. It all depends on what store you work in as to how good your day was. The company overall seems to be a good company.
good,"I work there every weekend from 6am- 6pm. I get to scan boxes, put them in places where I'm told to put it, and I've learned that the hours get really long every time I think about it. The hardest part of the job is that it takes up my whole weekend. I don't get to do anything because after work I'm always so tired. But what I really love about this job is that I get to work hard and lift stuff because it's a good way for me to lose weight. Lol!"
good,This job is best for a seasonal employee or a college student.  The management wasnt very honest while i was there and the cant keep employees for long periods of time
good,"Lowe's currently laid off thousands of loyal employees who've put in decades of work. Lowe's seems like a great place to work at first, but the ""team"" is never really a team. Great for a starter job, worthless to retire from."
good,"A very active job, constant movement. Daily tasks consisted of assisting customers, pulling orders, stocking, and keeping my department clean and organized. I learned how to operate powered equipment such as a order picker, forklift, and narrow aisle reach truck. Management was ok, they were helpful at some points, but between the tasks and time it was hard to get in touch with management. Workplace culture was very diverse, but it was very rough. Hardest part if this job was completing task there just wasn't enough time in a work shift to get everything done. The most enjoyable part of the job was operating power equipment."
good,There are different positions at Lowe's that some people feel great and not so great about. Fortunate for me I was blessed to see both sides of Lowe's.
good,Lowes is currently going under management restructuring. As a result people are being placed in charge of department's without knowledge of the department itself. Makes for a completely useless management structure even if they once were good managers.
good,"I still strongly believe in Lowe's vision and values at the corporate level. The DC used to have the same views; however in recent years leadership has become more like management and there is now a clear hierarchy structure. The ""Lowe's way"" has been lost.  TM's are treated as the general population and are easily replaceable no matter how long they've been there or how loyal they've been."
good,"Lowe's employees have volunteer opportunities, "
good,poor advancement track even after meeting all sales goals and making the store more profitable i was not recognized for achievements. This company says they want to enter new roles in contractor sales but are unwilling to adapt to that culture.
good,"Great place to work, in general. The company has a very competitive salary and good policies, couple of cookouts a year for employees."
good,"I learnt a lot at Lowe's. I started working in the Garden section and then worked in the inside garden selling grills, lawn mowers, insecticides etc.."
good,Well I think it  would be a great company to work for if they took better care of  there employees and maybe paid more and also give room for advancement  let there employees know they are appreciated
good,enjoyed my time there. would recommend others for employment. Good training programs whilei was there. Benefits were good and time off was better than some
good,I liked working at Lowe's the people were nice  and I enjoyed going to work every day.Although lifting the appliances  was a challenge I never let it stop me I used it as a work out.
good,"I climbed the ladder quickly here, and soon figured out why. Numbers were hard to reach, but not impossible. The company was going through a culture change as the housing industry was declining. I still enjoyed the atmosphere and the customers, and most of the management was pleasant as well."
good,"Lowe's Overall is a good company to work for if you're young, just starting out and looking for a job to make decent money. However, if you're a bit older and need a good income and have a lot of financial responsibilities, Lowe's may not be for you."
good,Lowe's is a good place to work.Some of employees are willing to work hard and others are not. This needs to be further  pursued by the Company. It's a customer service industry and could use deeper training for it's employees. They provide great PK (product knowledge) training but the turn over of employees is at a high rate.
good,"The culture there was very isolated, and most employees were very unfriendly.  It was easy work, and it payed quite well; however, it was not worth the stress provided by the crew."
good,The Pro's and Con's come down to one thing. . .your store manager. If you have a good store manager its not a bad place to work. If you have a poor store manager you will not want to stay very long.
good,"A good company but it is currently making major changes that I can not currently say that I would go back to.  While I was there, it offered me the opportunity to develop my skills and for that I am grateful."
good,Learning opportunities in different department that is helpful for the customer support and  to apply in our practical life. lots of varieties of products are available.
good,I put up returns and restocked shelves. I interacted with customers to help them find what they were looking for. I dusted and cleaned my area. I enjoyed learning about plumbing.
good,It was a fun job at first but the store i worked at was trying to do to much for what they could handle.  After 2 and a half years it started to go downhill as a good work enviroment
good,"Great people and place to work. Work all departments of the store other then Lumber. Stocking is hard work none stop. Learning new departments and inventory."
good,good job no complain everyone  people was ok good atmosphere great place to work for would recommend to anyone.apply and get in the company good managers
good,"I did not mind working at lowes. Except for changing schedule , and pay that did not reflect my skill. I was given opportunity to work on my own , as long I got job done no one bothered me."
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job is the associates. If they feel good about where they work and their leadership, then it shows in our level of customer service and sales."
good,"Lowes was a good job to have, there were many good bennifits. It was a good friendly invironment to work in, the only reason I left was because I had a child and wanted to be a stay at home mom for a bit."
good,"Not much room for creative input or advancement into mgmt, shift schedules never set, must be flexible week to week for anything because could be either early morning or late at night, full timers have to be willing for whatever."
good,If you are a regular sales associate be prepared to work outside of your department at times and answer or try to answer questions that you have no knowledge about. To me this was very beneficial and kept the job interesting.
good,Worked at Cashier and refund desk daily. Some cleaning and stocking required. I learned a lot about home building and repair items. The management was very fair and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees.
good,Low pay. 8 hours a day. there is not a lot of room for growth. This job is a typical retail job. Lots of younger people that worked at the location I was at.
good,I like the place but the hours are not the greatest. Pay could be better no full time available i like what in  am doing but would like doing it with a full time position with benifits
good,It isn't bad a job just the hours aren't always distributed evenly and get cut.  It's very stressful when customers ask for products we don't have and yet ask about them. Management is the greatest
good,Store managers come and go about ever 3-5 years destroying any good thing going on with wanting there own agenda.  The store manager and Assistant managers dont have your back and make you look a fool in front of customers.
good,Normally I would open the department before we opened the store by cleaning the paint tinters. make sure that any stock left on the floor is put on the shelves. Generally make sure that the department is clean and ready for customers. The best part of working there is helping customers get exactly what they need.
good,"There were days where I literally couldn't go to the bathroom because I was inundated with so many customers, customer complaints, tasks, reports, cycle counts, emails...etc. Very stressful, and management didn't seem to care that their employees were stressed to the max ."
good,"The management seemed to be in a state of flux, that is they were not able to engage with the employees for very long as they would accept other positions within the Lowe's Company."
good,"A typical day at Lowes includes safety walks, inventory stocking, customer service and sells. Lowes can be fast paced sometimes and the customers are demanding."
good,"I spent most of my employment in a Senior Manager role, the companies benefits are in line with other retail companies.  Some of the managers could use training on how to handle personnel issues, there was a lot of decisions being made based on their personal opinions of the employees."
good,"Store managers and assistant managers can be rude and not very informative, often lie to the customers. Example, during black Friday sale for Christmas trees customers were given a delivery before Christmas day. I worked Christmas Eve and customers were calling because they had not gotten their Christmas trees. Come on now!"
good,"The company is great, benefits are outstanding. Sadly what is lacking is consistency in its management style. Each store decides in what policy they want to follow."
good,"capable supervisors, long tenured employees.had hoped for full or part time afterwards however business had slowed store wide.hence my review of upper corporate management."
good,Its hectic and all about making sales. You have multiple duties such as working your area and stocking and refilling empty shelves. As well as other C.S.A duties.
good,Great place to work and very dedicated for constant teamwork to get tasks completed through out the day. Must be ready and willing to constantly learn new things with a willingness to work in many different parts of the store.
good,"Some days are good and some is just rough. patience is a virtue. typical carpentry work recommend, highly skill carpenter if applying for Lowes. Need better management."
good,"Great pace of work, but inexperienced managers, pace began to get faster with less people, people slept quitting, lots of friction between workers, and a lot of drama."
good,I've spent a lot of years working for Lowe's. They offer great benefits. They love to help people love where they live. It's a competitive market. Depending on your postition with the company it really can be a great/rewarding place to work.
good,things could be fun at work with manager and customers but if someone was having a bad day they would ruin it for everyone working(managers). just me personally
good,"Management can be a lot better wish they would've been more concerned to help out more with coaching and becoming a better receiver.  "
good,"Had  a great time working for this company, when they brought in new management the store went down.  They starting cutting and firing the wrong people like people who really needed jobs and kept the ones who did not work hard"
good,Lowes is a clean and safe place to work they teach you all about safety issue. Education on growth of how much equity is brought in each month.how to greet customers in a friendly manner .clean book keeping I have several forklifts licensed while I worked there .the really down fall about Lowes is its hard to move to full time employee other than that it's a really good place to work .
good,I worked as a lot associate and assisted customers with their merchandise. I did translated for customers that spoke Spanish to English and from English to Spanish.
good,LOWES IS a great place to work actual love this job . New management came in and they all were very in fair not treating everyone with respect. Overall great experience.
good,Lowes is a OK place to work they just need to make a few changes that would make life easier for everyone. they need to give a better raise to there employees that would them more reason to stay at lowes for a longer period of time
good,The employee's were hardworking and very helpful to one another. The customers were fun to help. Sometimes the work was physically unmanageable. It was exhausting. There were times when employee's did not receive breaks.
good,rather disorganized loading procedures. every morning we the drivers would have to comb the store like a treasure hunt for everything that was supposed to go on their trucks.
good,"Since I was at lowes for a many of years, I was the goto guy. I trained just about everybody there and was paid the least. They have changed everything that they do there now ahick left me with no room for advancing."
good,"As with any big box store such as Lowes and Home Depot, there is always slackers and drama. Do your job efficiently and stay out of the drama and you can go places."
good,"A busy work environment."
good,Fun friendly people that love to have a good environment around them. Like all jobs it might get a little overwhelming on black Friday and holidays but you have a great team to back you up.
good,the job was pretty decent the hours was just hard but the job came with alot of benefits and i also learned how to operate a fork lift  an the management was pretty good also
good,"It was a very decent company to work for. I wasn't a fan of the 4 week rotating schedule and at times it was more stressful than anything. "
good,"Lowes had a very friendly environment, i learned how to drive power equipment through Lowes which was very helpful. great job for students needing money through college"
good,We were all unable to establish a work time. the time to attend work was different all the time instead of a consistency. It is important especially for new comers in a new work environment.
good,job was ok and workers were cool but had a lot of rude customers enter into the store. Raises were ok..............................................................Management could have been a lot better.
good,"Working here is great if you going to college."
good,Worked Mondays through Thursdays from 5pm to 4:30am - work 4 days a week 40 hours. On the 3rd shift and that was the deciding factor on me leaving Lowes. It was Fun and fast pace work.
good,"No matter what position into which you are hired in this company, you will be expected to almost literally carry your own weight. I daresay I have never been more physically fit as a direct result of my employment.  A work place that will always provide challenges for their employees to overcome."
good,"Management restructure has created undo stress."
good,"No communication, they only act like they care when corporate comes so they look good but if they followed that same action all the time the store would be a much better place as well if they hired more people because it gets pretty busy and then cashiers have to hear customers complain but they have no control on the scheduling"
good,"Great company, but the hours and schedules are unhealthy for a family life or personal life. Pay is good and ability to advance is high. Training programs are very helpful"
good,"Productive work environment, taught me to always stay busy and make sure all of my tasks are completed before I leave. The people in the workplace are nice and understanding. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the random schedule postings. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with awesome people."
good,"While working for this company you quickly realize that they try to make it a team or family environment. Lowe's gives you the training that is needed and makes sure that they don't put you in any situation that you are not ready for and if you do have questions then associates have information available to answer any they may have. However, the pay is not enough to deal with the abuse from customers. Lowe's is more customer focused then protecting associates from a angry customer with a unsatisfied experience either with associate, product, or company policy. Lowe's allows customers to continue with the abuse with completing online surveys or calling the corporate which is all public access. Associates can also get praise through the same survey."
good,"Overall, Lowes is a great company to work for. Good benefits and decent pay for the job. Since Lowes is retail, your typical day would be as expected...customer service & more customer service."
good,The most enjoyable part of th day is talking my co-workers because they are friend and amusing. But new employees do not get trained because at times it is really busy.
good,The company believes in customer satisfaction and does somewhat of a good job executing that. They could use some work however on further training there employees so that they are as knowledgeable and helpful to customers as possible.
good,"Almost everyone at Lowes was very friendly, both staff and management, besides a few people. They were usually very understaffed which made work hectic at times. They also came to be quite stingy with giving people hours."
good,The hardest part of the job would be accomendating multiple customers at one time.Customers expressing their satisfaction would be a highlight of the job.
good,The Lowe's corporation has a huge turnover in employment.  It seems that at times there are not enough employees to cover the store.  Typically on the evening shift the individual may be covering 2 to 3 departments.  However there is always opportunity for advancement.
good,"Your responsibilities are minimal. If you're a people person you will do fine. As far as cashier jobs go, its pretty typical, but with Lowe's you are paid well, routinely get store bonuses for anywhere from $50-$150, get guaranteed breaks and lunches, an insurance."
good,The jobs are always being added online. It was easy to apply and find something interesting to do. There was always something to do. It was fun while it lasted.
good,"Typical retail setting - tough hours, management was very limited."
good,Hard to advance inside the company unless you have been employed for 5 years or more. Managers are inconsistent with inventory work. Great human resource director.
good,"Lowe's is a company that expects everything from every one of it's associates in a day, and believe me when I say it's A LOT. My day typically consisted of putting up product then selling said product through a three step process that took about two weeks. Overall Lowe's is a pretty sweet gig. I had competitive pay, benefits (including stock options), and a real sense of accomplishment. "
good,working at Lowe's can be a stressful experience depend on which department you are working for.  I worked in the shipping and receiving department which was not so bad. then Lowe's made changing to the department and it has become a very stressful place to work. It has become micro management.
good,A nice place to work. I don't' have much to say about the company. I think my thoughts are personal and private. I don't know who this information is going to. And because of that that I feel I should not be expected to tell you much about my company.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of general maintenance of fork lifts and powered pallet jacks, also receiving of all purchase orders accurately. The most enjoyable part of the job was training and teaching associates for power equipment training."
good,It was fast paced and always busy from time you clocked in until you left. Management there was always helpful. Hardest part was being on feet all day.
good,"Lowes was a descent company to work for.  It was just hard to advance in the company.  It was hard work to stand on a concrete floor for 8-10 hours a day, and they would typically call you off break to come to the front and work if there were huge lines up front."
good,"Learned a ton of valuable life skills that help me in my day to day life as well as my professional career. first time I worked for a retail store  , and was able to move up very quickly , due to my great work ethic. They train their employees very well in both product knowledge and management skills."
good,I have been with the company for 6 years and I can say I have learned a lot working for this company. I have learned very good customer Service and taught me to have a lot of patience for.
good,Lowes is a good place to work. I was a delivery driver and there was days that get long but you just keep pushing along and eventually with experience the days will get easier.
good,"Considering a position outside using machinery and caring for plants away from the general employee drama, it was a good run. Would not consider doing it anymore, though."
good,I worked at Lowes after high school. While here I received a lot of management skills. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers that came in.
good,On a typical work day there are daily task and interaction  with clients and installers. I gained more communication skills and computer skills as well as money handling. The management team is well educated but needs to hear some of employees suggestions to make the work environment better. The workplace culture lacks a lot of communication which makes it difficult to give the full customer service experience that we should be giving which makes it also the hardest part of the job. Lastly the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with clients and gaining more knowledge.
good,"I learned a lot from Lowes. But the more I learned the more I was taken advantage. They didn't care much about quality of work and more about rushing through projects. "
good,"stressful doing 2 full time jobs, pulling orders and then loading and delivering them. Favorite part, driving to do deliveries and working with the customers"
good,"Good place to work for the most part, there are room for improvements but overall a good place. The management is sometimes stifled by red tape but they try their best."
good,I would have really recommended our company before restructure happened but now the company and CEO is letting everyone know we are all replaceable and no one matters
good,I have never worked for Lowe's Home Improvement. I did however work for Lowes Foods. I bought a really nice lawn mower at LHI and they have good customer service.
good,I enjoyed working at owes but there wasn't much space for moving up in the company. Hours were constantly being cut. Management had poor leadership skills.
good,They are very flexible with your work schedule especially if your are in school. Managers and employees are willing to work with you. Employees are good with customers assistance.
good,"was a good place to learn and work with new people"
good,Decent Company but with current restructure going on no job is safe my department was given 3 weeks notice that our position was being outsourced other departments where let go with no notice.
good,Lowe's/Management always seemed to be laying employees off to try and save as much money as possible.  It's a good job for anybody who doesn't need benefits and/or retired.  You'll always feel shorthanded on employees and overworked.
good,"Long hours on your feet, corporate culture has everyone wondering if their actions are ""by the book"""
good,You never know if you are going to come in and have a job for another day or not. Some of the managers do not take their job to heart like the regular associates do
good,"Lowes is a good place to work if they’d get their management together. And the managers knew how to schedule people, they cut hours too much, and don’t hire people when they need to"
good,lots of training and development  activities . Also lots of employee appreciation programs. Lowes has stores in almost every state in the united states and canada.
good,"Fun starter job for teenagers, willing to work and pay for schooling as in college. Great if your in high school trying to earn just a few extra bucks in the evenings if you do not mind the closing times."
good,"Bilinguel cashier, processing checks, offering customer information about the crdit cards low intrest rates, motivated to work around learning new departments"
good,"It's an ok job, but not what I'd want in a career. Seems like you have to a part of the in-crowd to get advancement at the store. They are good about letting me have days off that i request and they do have a really good benefits package"
good,The employees of this company are courteous and great to work with. Every job has its ups and downs but in the long run I have been there for over 8 years and have enjoyed it.
good,It's a good place to work with benefits and a great culture. Safety is the main thing to worry about while you're there. Nothing is more important than safety.
good,Constantly moving retail environment.  Helping customers with many projects from lawn maintenance to mixing paint. Feel accomplished when you help a customer complete a project
good,Disliked working here. The pay is good but lack of staff and never having anyone present to help you out was just annoying. Was a very stressful job and I would not recommend working here.
good,Lowesbis a good company the problem with them when i worked thwre was that they dont pay enough and they need more employees they will make you run from one side of the store to the other and not care that is there goal i guess because they dont hire anymore people.
good,"Busy fast pased sales and service enviroment. Customer centric, sales driven culture. High store standards to ensure a pleasurable shopping experience. Once in a salry position there is limited work life balance"
good,Since the restructure it stinks. very stressful and no one can get along.  lots of drama and stress. Stay away. Unless you like not getting many hours and being stressed out.
good,the job i did at lowes was decent. management was alright but HR was a very bad manager. she didnt do her job and delegated her tasks to other hourly employees
good,"The work was not for me, but the culture was great, people were great, and it could be a good fit for others. I was just not passionate about selling lawnmowers."
good,"Great company to get the basic skills you need to prepare yourself for a future, but not something to do for a very long time. A lot of recent restructuring has morale down in the stores. Decent wages for the job."
good,"There are some really nice people here, don't get me wrong. In fact, the place is basically held together by just a few good folks. That said, there is no real advancement, poor salary for most (except Class A drivers which get average pay), really bad communication between departments, and an overall lack of enthusiasm among 95% of the employees. Overall, it was one of the most uninspired places I've worked. I'd suggest it only as a stepping-stone to something better. Sorry!"
good,"long hours maybe 7 days at stretch depending on store. Job security is at a low due to company restructure. Lowe's isn't at the forefront never have been in innovation. Always behind Home  depot hasn't had great stocks in over a decade, shares hasn""t split in over 15 yrs.The company networking system is Genesis, WTH it's 2017 and the use Genesis!!!!!!!!"
good,"A typical day here started early, and gradually became more busy throughout the day.  There were times when it was very busy, which I appreciate. I enjoyed that fast paced environment, and the slower days as well."
good,"It has its benefits.  The management needs improvement, there are a lot of changes which has been scaring the employees that work hard there to support their families"
good,Overall decent retail company to work for. Company provided a decent quality of life for management. At the time I worked for them they had a very competitive bonus structure in place for management team
good,I work at a lowes that dominated by the spanish culture. Its hard to help customers when you don't know what they are saying. Beside that lowes is a pretty laid back job. It is a teamwork job.
good,"Lowes is a good first time job,  or entry level job.  If you can show up to work and never need to call out for anything you will love this job.  There a few managers and people in lead who are amazing and then there are a few who love control.  Drama is a given but that is to be expected at any place of work from what  I have heard."
good,"A lot of cross training, paid time off, vacation, medical, dental, 401k, worked different shifts everyday. Schedule is out 2 weeks in advance. I was able to trade shifts withing my department when needed time off"
good,"good place to work ,nice managers ,and pleasant work environment "
good,Lowe's needs improvement in many areas of the store first being management using the power they have been given. Employees seemed to disrespect management
good,"On a typical day, we will see 500 customers.  Each person working needs to know in the general area where the items we sell are located.  The customer comes usually, knowing what they need.  We answer questions and suggest items that might be needed to complete their project."
good,I worked here for the season and during that time there was a lot to do and training you had to keep up on. I had to take tests at least once a week to keep up with what's in stock and to be aware of what I was helping customers with.
good,I enjoyed working for Lowes until I because a supervisor. Then it just became a mess including the new changing of management. It's been hard on everyone with the new changes.
good,I really enjoyed working with the customers here and my co-workers.  I had time to learn what I needed to do my job on a daily basis.  Managment was not on the same page and so one would tell you to do this and then the other would tell you to do something different.
good,You can earn a lot of technical information from working here; you meet a lot of people in the industry who do different jobs; there is some company mobility
good,Large company for career starter opportunities and ability to learn about the retail industry. Wide variety of roles and ability to work large scale programs.
good,simple backroom work unload trucks check in inventory setup pallets on the floor for late night stockers drive the forklift pull orders very simple and straight to the point
good,"a variety of customers, and employees,  fun place to work, but not enough coverage on floor to help customers.  management spread out can't  handle customer needs as fast as they should"
good,"There's not much to say. It's a good way to gain job experience and get a proper workout while you're at it. "
good,"overall fun great place could use a few updates on some things but great "
good,The company has cut their management in half. People about to retire lost their jobs and were told they had to find another job by January.  CEO no longer cares for employees.
good,Depending on which department you're put in will ultimately decide how your experience at Lowes will be. I was put in the OSLG department but I've worked in most of the other departments in the store. OSLG is hot during the summer and slow during the winter with at times a pretty size able workload. I don't recommend working at the front end or as a truck unloader although I've met people who enjoy both. The pay is actually pretty decent comparatively and it beats the heck out of working at a fast food restaurant or most other entry level jobs. Most people only work seasonal and if you're like me after nearly 4 years you'll be tired of it.
good,Lowe's employees form a un pique bond that feels like family.  Everyone knows everyone and is involved in their everyday lives.  Everyone cares for each other.  It's a great family feeling.
good,"Living wage, but otherwise much the same as all retail jobs. Unpredictable hours, understaffed. This location had a very pleasant group of people to work with."
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for. The restructure has changed some things up however, if you are in management as SSM then it's preparing you to move to the next level."
good,Management needs real improvement. Coworkers were great and always friendly. Like I stated earlier just an average job for someone in high school or just out of it.
good,"Rarely received Break"
good,"Changes in company structure has had a negative impact  on the employees it is hard to get a hold of a manager when you or a customer needs them. No encouragement,  support or thanks"
good,"Unload, scan, and count all items received. After products are scanned into the system, all merchandise is moved to the sales floor."
good,It has it ups and downs but with the last round of jobs cuts and restructuring it has taken time to get the balance back.  Customers expect a lot from us and sometimes it is challenging with the new structures. We strive to keep it customer focussed and build as many relationships as possible.
good,"Understaffed, No clear direction in what employees need to accomplish.  Hard to get tasks done in this kind of environment. The moral is declining more and more each day.  Lot's of staff turnover as staff do not get enough hours."
good,Great job for someone to get into during the last years of high school and throughout College. Working EVERY Holiday would be the hardest part! Glad for my time there
good,"Lowe's as a corporation seeks to differentiate itself from its main rival, Home Depot.  It succeeds in varying degrees.  Often, the experience for the customer is more helpful and friendly, but not always.  The Lowe's in Parkville has had some ups and downs of store management, which has affected morale of employees.  Some policies initiated at the upper corporate level have also had effects on the day to day store employee. As is usually the case in retail, an individual employee, and her or his attitude, make all the difference in the world for a customer's experience."
good,A typical day at work includes helping customers and stocking shelves. I learned how to deal with people in a professional way. Management is alright. The culture was rather stressful. The hardest part of the job is being understaffed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits.
good,"Challenging, Learned a lot about stocking. Most days were very busy. Learned how to multi-task very fast.  Gained good stocking experience. Management was hardworking along with us."
good,It is a good place to work with very nice employees as well as management team.  Very good for people who need a flexible work schedule and still be compensated well.
good,you would be lock in store from for the duration of the shift and work got boring because you had to stretch your work load last all night or you would be force to do someone else work
good,"My job was fun,  for the most part. Some of the management had their favorites. And was a little hard on the ones that really worked and did their jobs."
good,They were a good company to work for because they give job opportunities frequently. The biggest flaw with this company is they do not back their employees before customers. Even when the customer is way out of line.
good,I found a job that the advancement was better in the end. It gave me a chance to further my education and go into the medical field where I could branch out.
good,Great job for people looking to make rent money. It is not the place if you want to grow within the company. Its a popularity contest. Pays decently..
good,Easy place to work if you wanna excel at your job. Hardest part is dealing with customers. Certain managers can make the place hard to deal with. Used to be fun until corporate made changes.
good,It was a fun place to work overall you meet many differnt people from all walks of life and get the opportunity to help the fullfill there home improvement need's. The down side I would say at time's at the one store that I worked in the managment team seemed to be a bit disorganized. The last critic is isolated to that one store and only for that period of time I do not feel like that represents the company as a whole.
good,The company have to much turnover..Store managers don't stay long makes it hard have a steady leader.Pay is good shifts can change often.Very seasonal
good,"What I loved about working at Lowe's was the different faces I would see come in the store. I loved seeing my coworkers as well, but seeing customers and hearing random stories from them as I checked them out was the most interesting part of it."
good,"I worked in customer service."
good,Worked the night shift here for 2 years straight. The manager was on a wild power trip and would call you to work on your days off. The worst part was if you declined to come in on your day off he would threaten to cut your hours.
good,"Large operation trying to become ""omni-channel"".  Great location for home improvement needs,  lots of products at low prices.  Corporate seems to be unsure of what direction to go with its future though, partially-embracing technology and new ways of shopping."
good,They put the customer ahead of the employee most times and that was not okay. They also would bend the rules more than necessary and all the managers had favorites
good,"it was hard work being new to that company and new to retail, establish my work ethic with all the task and objective I had to complete. great company."
good,"Store management was fine, market staff would interpret policy to suit the situation or their needs.  Hardest part of the job was customers wanting us to solve problems immediately without giving us time to gather information."
good,"Good company to work for the people were very knowledgeable in there individual departments. main issue i had with the company is there not being enough employees to cover a shift effectively, causing issues with taking care of the customers."
good,"Lowes is trying hard to figure out what it wants to be.  Working in Pro Services, you aren't given the flexibility to pull in commercial jobs or accomodate contractors like smaller lumber companies can."
good,"great staff, friendly, always willing to help. discount was 10 percent and i was always in the back for the unloading of merchandise trucks and drove forklift"
good,"Fast paced working environment "
good,"The management is a bunch of monekys, a child could do a better job of making a balanced schedule than these guys. but if you dont ever want to spend quality time with your family then this is the place for you."
good,"Typical day at work consists of maintaining service level, following up with employees tasks. Day to day business functions. The Store culture varies by store. Hardest part of the job is trying to complete tasks with limited staffing. Most enjoyable part of the job his helping customers."
good,A typical day at work consist of dealing with customers who need every day items for their house or job. Here I've learned the importance of making the customer happy. My presentation and attitude towards an every day shopper can easily make a decision if the client wants to continue business. I am seeking more opportunities and advancement to better my job career.
good,Bad pay they did not pay enough for what I was working therefore I quit I was sick of working 12 hour days and weekends and only making 300 a week. Do not recommend
good,"Enjoyed leading the flooring department managing inventory, department recovery, sales staff, customer interaction, installations orders, and filling customer orders. Led department last year to over $250,000 in sales over projections."
good,Lowe's Foods was my first job and it was one that taught me a lot about what was required to keep a workplace running. In addition to cashier/bagging we did lots of chores to keep the store in shape.
good,If you want to make quick money and not do a lot of work be a cashier at lowes. They don't ask too much of you. Depending on the store and the management yoy may love it
good,The organization is focused on safety.  I am currently employed at Lowes.  I enjoy the people I work with.  I enjoyed being exposed to all parts of the store.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company. It gave me the ability to grow to be a more productive and effective team member. I would highly recommend this employer to others.
good,"Was a great company to work for, with yearly raises, great benefits, and opportunity for advancement, however, with recent corporate restructures, the place has become somewhat of a joke. Corporate has no idea how things work, or what is good for the store level."
good,The company is constantly changing policies. one day I got in trouble for going to the bathroom when I was on the clock. told me I had to wait for my breaks to go to the bathroom.. well I cant hold it in and I had to go...
good,"A lot of interaction with the customers. Fun place to work. "
good,"I worked with a very pleasant, professional team.  My manager was engaged and conscientious.  My immediate area was enjoyable and positive, but IT as a whole experienced multiple changes in direction in a relatively short time frame.  This made it difficult to set effective goals and plan long-term objectives.  On the whole, I believe this is a decent company to work for, but I feel that they need to solidify their overall direction and business plan for IT."
good,"Created Kitchen and Bath designs"
good,"I learned the organization of warehouse shipping, loading,and building. Worked with many forklift machines. Bonus's were offered frequently  based on performance,"
good,"Working at Lowes was a great experience. It was hard work loading and unloading things all day on and off of trucks. The management was nice and informative. They worked with me being out continuously on Doctor's care regarding the wreck I had in April of 2016. I was however not eligible for rehire, at the time my Doctor released me to go back to work due to a car wreck in April of 2016."
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for, at least at the store I worked. It was easy to get along with most everyone and management for the most part would listen to what you had to say even if they really couldn't do anything to change a situation. They usually tried to give you an answer and most of the time if they didn't have one they would tell you and not make something up. I really enjoyed my time there."
good,I loved working at lowes got to learn different things about the job got to interact with different customers working with different machines gave me alot of experience as well
good,Loved working hard and being outside all day. Enjoyed driving forklift and interacting with customers and caring for the plants. Friendly environment as well
good,"It was so long ago, all of the management is different now. Whenever I worked there, it was fine. Management was great. Things are very different now. I am not sure how it goes."
good,"Helping tons of people each day, at times it was fast paste. Learned that all people are not the same. I liked the people that I worked with. Management had a high turn over rate."
good,10 years in retail management. Very fast paced environment with many associates to manage that are working in an array of different departments. Multitasking is a must and the ability to make decisions on the spot to ensure company goals are met.
good,Good working environment except that the management and corporate only cares for themselves and constantly cut hours in order to save money for bigger bonuses.
good,"assist director with all employee needs, provide high- level administrative support by conducting research, and handling information request. Perform payroll, timekeeping."
good,Great people. Full of great people and great opportunities. You get recognized for hard work and for pushing yourself to help further the company. Definitely suggest this company for employment!
good,"Order picker, operated many different pickers selecting orders working in hot and cold temperatures, finding different locations, operating different forklifts."
good,"The people are great; however, the company needs to revisit their recent restructuring. The work load has significantly increase. Our store is currently operating with about 20 position yet too be filled."
good,"Hard work and plenty of it. Always something new to learn even after 10 or more years. Management is hit or miss, but usually you can find a few that you will be able to develop a relationship with. Hardest part of the job is the rotating schedules and trying to fit your family in around it."
good,"the shipping, the people are really cool, management is there they help out and hear you out if you are in need of anything, as long as you do your job you will be good"
good,Cool job good pay. Hours aren't very flexible. Spent a lot of time working nights and weekends. Back bending labor. Learned a lot about paint and painting that I never knew before.
good,"When I worked for Lowe's, the main problem I encountered was that there were too many employees working at any given time.  While this is a good problem to have, it also meant that the majority of employees, who were part time, did not get many hours.  I was given a schedule of 9-10 hours per week."
good,There were times when the person scheduling will make it so that there would be no managers in your area and I was sometimes left on my own within the first month to manage the entire outdoor area.
good,"It has been really hard for me at Lowes. I felt like a number and like I had nowhere to advance. Tried for full-time 5 times and they always gave it to less qualified individuals. I never called in, was always on time, and always finished what I was told fast and efficiently but morals, skill, and experience doesn't seem to matter here. It's a shame really, because most of the management was incredible."
good,The customers that came to Lowe's were for the most part friendly. They wanted to get in and get out. I would assist the customers to their needs and wants.
good,"It's an ok place to work,  they just need to hire more people. They are trying to run the store on the bare minimum staff. All in all though, not a terrible job."
good,Lowes has definitely changed in the past 8 years. Change can either be good or bad. My personal belief is that it has changed not for the worst but definitely not for the best. If you're looking for a part-time job it can be a good place to work as for a career I don't suggest it.
good,"You will find Lowe's to be an amazing retail store to work at."
good,"My every day mission was to make sure I greet each customer with a smile and help them solve issues when it came to some of their home projects. Also, I was their to answer their question and make sure that once they left they had a better understanding of what they were asking."
good,There is a variety of hours and days to work. The pay is good. The schedules are flexible. The benefits are good and they work with school schedules. .
good,The staff and management were great. I loved to work there. Everyone worked together and it was a great team atmosphere. I loved how everyone came together to make the job easy and fun.
good,Early shifts great hours only had to work 3 days a week 12 hour shifts management wasn't that great at times but left alone to work by myself all the time with too big of a workload.
good,"Fast pace busy varied. On line order process "
good,This job was a good seasonal job. Great customers! As far as the company there were some things with the supervising staff. Many favors were done depending on who you know.  Did not think it was fair to all the employees.
good,"I enjoy working here but company  restructuring  has me looking for stable employment.  After twelve years, i have gained vast knowledge of the home improvement industry and am looking to move forward"
good,working in a grocery store at a  young age thought me the values of working hard. for your first job this is were you would like to be. you can learn cashiering and stocking shelves.
good,It helped me get where I needed to be. It by no means is adequate for someone who is trying to raise/support a family. They do give you adequate hours and the pay is decent for the field of work they are in.
good,"Lowe's is a convenient job for college students who need a job that will pay super well and be flexible enough to work with their busy schedule. However, advancing in this company is very hard."
good,"good IT organization , too much politics , too many vendors , chaos in releases and people management"
good,"Great company to work for. Hours are all over the place depending on whether or not you're full time or part time, ranging from 12 per week to 50. Overall not bad"
good,I don't really have anything much to say about working at lowes. It is the kind of job that is just a job to make ends meet unless you are really into lowes.
good,"This is a great job if you are looking for fast paced challenges. There is no doubt every day you get pushed to your maximum capabilities balancing between tasks and customer service. Though at times whats expected of you is just outright impossible, you have to let it bead off of you and realize you are only one person and can only do as much as you can."
good,"Overall not a terrible place to work. Some of the middle level managers will try to give you a hard time because their bosses give them a hard time so they pull some ""power moves"" but if you just shrug it off or go with it then you'll be fine. Loved all of my co-workers."
good,The job that I had was very stressful and high demanding. I learned that you must protect the business and do your best to satisfy the customers. Management was strict and unfair.
good,The company can sometimes seem innovative but other times revert back to the 1970s.  Its hard to know what we will be in store for from quarter to quarter.  There are many forces at work at the highest levels and meandering direction reflects it.  There are many intelligent people there doing good work but projects can shift and priorities change.
good,"Lowes is a good company to work for.  They try very hard to keep their associates happy, and make a pleasant work place.  they have good benifits, ok pay, and good employee retention."
good,Really enjoyed working there. Learned allot about many different trades such as roofing and deck building. Provided great customer service interacting with the contractors and do it yourselfers. Very fun place to work with stable weekly hours.
good,"Used to be a wonderful place to work. Then the corporate heads got greedy and restructured the management within the store. Laid off people, demoted others. It's impossible to move up now. Stores are understaffed and paid has stagnated. Lowe's is on its last legs"
good,A typical day at work was dealing with customers and assisting them on products and services.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the public.
good,The department I work in now is great because every day is different and keep you very busy so time go fast.  We work with customer to create a new kitchen or bath.  You have to have good customer sevices skill because thing don't always go right and you still have to be able to make the customer happy.
good,"Employees have an opportunity to enjoy their lunch or company luncheon while learning products, educational tools, benefits, etc.  Feedback forms are highly recommended to share your process improvements that will benefit the company and employees"
good,"Hard working, fun as well as a learning experience, Learn how to set displaces for promotions. Management was worked alone with the crew. I enjoyed learning about the different product in the store."
good,"Lowes offers many opportunities to mo e up in the retail industry."
good,I was able to meet people from all walks of life at Lowe's which broadened my horizons and exposed me to different experiences. I learned a lot about customer service working here.
good,"It was not Ideal taking a retail position after field work in Plumbing but as retail goes, Lowe's has been the best large company I have ever been apart of."
good,"I worked for lowes for a short time. I thought I would really enjoy the job, but the promises made of the job requirements didn't come through. I was promoted quickly but again promises were not followed though."
good,I worked for Lowes only for a short time.  The commuting cost from my residence to work and back with the vehicle I was driving were high. The time I spent there was enjoyable working a as sales associate in the plumbing department.  Store Manager had a staff ralley each morning to rev up the trops and the rest of the day you did your job unbrothered.  I have nothing but praise for Lowes. I now visit the store as customer they always have what I need.
good,"Fun and helpful work environment. The employees are nice and willing to assist when ever neccisary, management is understanding, big focus on the customer"
good,The management team doesn't know how to talk to you they boss you around before you get on the clock and all they do is make customers mad. They dont know how to make a schedule and have one person in the am but five closing associates.
good,Typical retail.. Can't keep enough employees to get the job done.  Management is stressed to the max and trickles down the ladder.  Dealing with the customers is the best part of the job.  Within the last couple of months the management structure was changed and everyone feels it.
good,"I was a rep at the corporate office. The management was great and also professional, and would assist you any time you had a need. I had wonderful supportive co-workers and great benefits The down side is that the place doesn't have job security. I was laid off along with 500 plus employees from the corporate offices. This wasn't the first time they have done a massive lay off, they seem to have a history of it. They gave no notice whatsoever. Just went to work one day and had no job. Also the life/work balance was very poor. Given the hours I worked I seen my family little to none, and getting a schedule change was a real pain in the butt. I personally would not work for them again."
good,The job wasn't too bad. I just didn't like working weekends or holidays. Since it was just part-time the hours could get really sparse in the winter which made it hard to make ends meet some weeks.
good,Every since the restructure the company did moral across the board has been an all time low. Job security is very suspect with how this restructure is going. In my personal experiences its all about who you know if you wanna get anywhere past CSA.
good,I liked working at Lowes.  It was great at 1st then they started to cut hours and lie about promotions.  I worked hard in hopes of moving up.  I loved working for them. But soon it was a nightmare to just get the hours needed.
good,"had a great team that loved to work and help the customer! "
good,Learn  how to cope with different issues with customers and how to be a team player. I had a wonderful supervisor who played a big part in our lives and who was willing to go far and beyond for her employees.
good,"Management had lots of broken promises. Seemed to cater to the young kids that didn't know the meaning of work. Most of the time kids were on there cell phones and too busy to help some customers. Other than that,  I enjoyed working with customers in any projects that they had. If I didn't have a answer - I found there answer and also learned at the same time."
good,"Management at Lowe's has a tendency to play favorites. If you are not one of those favorites, your schedule is not ideal and it usually takes an arm and a leg to get a day off approved. Pay was good, I was a cashier so I interacted with the customers more than all of the other associates, but Lowe's is not a ""family"" like some workers will tell you. If you're in a job for the relationships with customers, this is a great place for you. If you take to heart how co-workers treat you and talk to you, I would look to work somewhere else."
good,After 16 years of loyal service with this company they terminated all department manager positions and I  was given 1 year to find other employment. I  thought I would retire with this company because it is a great place to work but corporate did a drastic job cut and left many people without a job regardless of their hard work loyalty and service they gave the company.
good,they need to really see how things get eected when they make changes. employees dont get a chance to get used to one change before something else changes.
good,"Full-time benefits are better than the actual work environment.  For a franchise that been around for quite a while, it always feels like you're having to work with management constantly under training, the departments never seem to come together in cooperation with guidelines and policies, the same mistakes keep being made, problems that need real attention keep getting pushed off to someone else's plate because of just negligence or corporate restrictions, and then you got those corporate birthed managers with their factory, forced smiles that need to work the actual department with the employees before they keep pushing their paperwork, engineered ideas.  However, many sales are being made at the end of each day!  I've worked in three different stores, and I've worked with one delivery department that had management with confidence, common sense and balances customer health with employee health.  Sadly, though, I think the delivery department is getting less and less attention for some reason.  Maybe they are shifting to a central dispatch."
good,"it is fast paced environment, i never got chance to work any retail sector, it was good experience, the leads are very good, gave opportunities to learn new things"
good,"new store policy in force makes it difficult to handle customers timely.  not open to employee suggestions for improvements."
good,It was good until we would get behind one day due to the truck being late. Our fellow cow workers didnt want to help us when we needed it. The people that were on my crew were plvery productive and we would get the store stocked and cleaned up when we were working as one.
good,Got paid vacation time and worked around my school schedule. The managers were also very nice as well. Wouldn't make the best career but if you're just needing working for a little while it was nice.
good,"Depending on the manager and what location you work at will determine the experience you have working for this company. Lowe's is a good company to work for however, recent changes in the management structure make it questionable on whether or not you can advance in the company."
good,"Great company to work for, great pay, just have the wrong people in management! Many chances for advancement if you are a yes man. Over all I did enjoy my time at lowes."
good,Lowe's needs to focus more on its customers and needs more organization.  Needs to hire better people who can do the job properly and need more coverage to have better customer service.
good,Nice place to work.  Hours were not great.  the hardest part of the job was working outside.  Not a lot of people of color worked as managers.  Too many young people as managers
good,Delivered appliances to consumers homes. Installed products as required.Drove several different vehicles daily. Worked varied shifts.Learned a lot abour appliances and how disgusting some people live.
good,The computer tutorials and meetings held were helpful for daily work functions. Management allowed room for learning while keeping it a professional environment.
good,This was a rough job.  It's a call center where I was working with point of sale and inventory software mostly.  The corporate structure is brutal to incoming contractors (contracting is how the employees are sourced) and difficult to get on full time as a Lowe's employee.
good,"It's a job. Great if your going to school or need something part time, because they are always hiring people. You learn a lot working there, tools, painting, lumber. All of the different departments."
good,"Management needs to seriously get more organized. no real worthwhile incentive program. at least not for delivery team.  manangement wants to hear ""solutions"". isn't that what they are there for? to figure out and provide those solutions"
good,"A typical day was that you stayed busy and learn new thing everyday, learned how to deal with people on the phone each day. The management was good. I had three different management to answer too. The hardest part was sometimes you didn't now which management to listen to because they all told you something different. Then one day they did a lay off and they did away with my job so I got a servant package. I enjoy working with the co-workers."
good,"Worked in outside lawn and garden. Learned to drive forklift. Loved co workers. Fair workplace, but employees are mostly part time. The days went by pretty quick in the spring."
good,"If you are a strong leader you will survive. There is a lot to learn an little time to learn it before being thrown to the proverbial wolves.. You are mostly self taught and upper management will complete surprise visits to gauge where you are at, and it is incumbent upon you to meet or exceed his expectations."
good,"My job duties included stocking shelves, loading merchandise into customer vehicles, trash removal, cart retrieval and cleaning and mopping of store floors."
good,I will say that my time at Lowe's was great until the last year of my employment there. Management is okay if you're with the in crowd/cool kids. Hardest part of the job was being expected to be friendly with customers but to help them as quickly as possible in order to keep lines down & when you weren't able to do this supervisors made you feel like dirt cause they had to help you instead of doing not much but talking. Too much favortism.
good,Can be a very stressful work environment.  They changed a lot over the years. I held several different positions during my years of employment with them.
good,"Find out where you will be at in the store, how to get a customer to get a credit card an save some money ,more communication between them, all Nationalities, Hours get cut, moving around giving breaks an lunches."
good,Couldn't schedule anything out further than a few days due to a non-regular schedule at work. Vacations were hard to guarantee due to unpredictable work schedule.
good,"As grown adults in a professional environment, you would think the petty rumors and backstabbing by now would be grown out of... no... you would be incorrect"
good,"I was glad to receive this position when I did since it was not considered a starting position, and it did come with a little more pay and responsibility, which for a youngster was nice.  The particular store I worked at was desperately understaffed, but those of us who worked there were close-knit and went above and beyond to the best of our abilities to make up for the shortage of employees."
good,"Good company but has the faults most large corporations have, unorganized and doesn't listen to employees they lose sight in keeping employees motivated to stay"
good,good work place very hard worker friendly with people and other employees always did what i was told to do and finish other tasks that needed to be done
good,"Millwork is a position which requires specific knowledge with doors, windows, moldings and other detailed products. Not many employees have the willingness to help in this department. There is some feeling of importance since the majority of repeat customers will only deal with my co-worker and myself. I get along with most people and am respected by fellow employees and customers."
good,Its hard to get hired full time without moving up through the company as an employee. But overall the job has its ups and downs but the compensation and extra activities the human recluse department does is great.
good,"nice place to work...clean work areas.. great supervisor."
good,"This wasn't a bad place to work. It was hard to move up at the location I was at though. The pay was very competitive because of the oil field work surrounding the location of this store. Therefore, a lot of people wouldn't leave their specific department jobs. It paid well."
good,Its A good place to work. Enjoy all the people that I work for. Move up the ladder pretty fast. The hard part of my job was working with so many different jobs.
good,"Very inefficient and non productive place to work.  Very little growth in career with low pay for worker.  Benefits are decent, leadership is weak and non existent."
good,Lowes can be a fun place to work if you want to work. But just remember to work safe and keep to yourself.This environment can be very stressful and cutthroat.
good,"It was fun, good in the same time because I try my best to help the customers,  make them happy and I learned many things from that job. The workers there they tried to help me in everything"
good,"Friendly coworkers, flexible hours (depending on the department), low wage.  It was an alright place to work when I needed part-time employment to work with my school schedule."
good,I had great satisfaction working with customers and showing product lines. Providing advice in customer projects was most gratifying. Worked in deliveries at one point which provided Box truck operating and installing appliances in homes.
good,Overall Lowes was a good company. Recently the company has went in the wrong direction. Lowes turned out to not be loyal to their hardest working associates.
good,"If you are not into changing environments, Lowe's is not the place to work. Everything changes on a daily basis, sometimes more frequently than that. It is a very fast paced environment."
good,Working for Lowe's was a brief experience. I loved getting to operate the propane Yale forklift to stock lumber and drywall. Lowe's was very kind to me.
good,Lack of growh and if you are not favored then you can not advance pay was not good there and it was not an place that could see myself staying for a long time
good,"I was the Administrative Assistant Store Manager with direct reports of the following departments: Cash office, customer service/checkouts, receiving, installed sales, delivery, and Loss Prevention."
good,Good company to work for if you don't mind working different shifts and working retail.  You will never know what your schedule will be from week to week.
good,"My time working at the lowes company turned out to be a disappointing experience to say the least, with no chance of advancement and a unacceptable work enviroment."
good,"Lowe's is, and has always been a great place to work. Fun people and great product. I have been employed there for 7 year and, other than a few missteps with management/personnel restructuring, I would recommend to anyone."
good,"The work life is okay, atmosphere is okay at first but things can change quickly when a company comes in and removes management and there is no proper staffing"
good,It is a high demand of work. you must work well with others in your department as well as other departments and be a team. It becomes hard when your peers are not willing to work together and everything is left on you.
good,I worked at lowes foods was a good job. liked my managers and most coworkers. i feel the company could be better to its employees and their needs along with the efficiency of the company.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowe's, however my position was eliminated during the layoffs in early 2017. It seems the intent was just to reduce staff/headcount and then determine a path forward once the dust settled. All my former peers describe the atmosphere as ""chaos, unorganized, and defeated."" Disappointing that so many lost their jobs without a clear vision for the direction the company will be headed in during the coming years. Hope they can turn it around soon."
good,"I loved my position however there was never any job security, mgmt would walk in and say your fired to associates in front of other associates, no open door policy respected, loss prevention was horrible and that made our jobs harder"
good,the job was easy it was just that sometimes we were under staff on busy days and given no help. other than that some of the people there made it fun to come back to work.
good,"Wonderful company to work with and I love that they work with my busy schedule! I cant complain about the compensation because its wonderful as a student.  However, the new management team isn't the most supportive of their employees or customers."
good,"Hardest place to work"
good,"Hopefully this site is able to offer me positions that I am able to decide if they are a suitable part of mine and my families life. It will be fair, accepts all I have to give as well as I am able to receive from it."
good,Average Company on Fed Contract Market. Management is very nice and take personal visits regularly. Benefits are almost the same of other Fed Contractors at average level.
good,I was a part time cashier. I was unable to walk like 5 ft away from my register to assist customers. They pay was good however. The management was average.
good,"I was a cashier at lowes, it was a very fast, got to be good with people skills, some mangers were nice some not so much.............................................."
good,Individual contributors continually work with each other for the benefit of the company.  This is a great part of working for Lowe's.  The people doing the work are great and will do what it takes to get the job done.
good,this job taught me a lot about how to be a team player as well as to be willing to put myself in a position to have a better work ethjc while remaning loyal to the customers.
good,"Work all depends on what shift your working. Opening shift, in the paint department, you clean the paint machines, calibrate the color match machine, put away freight, and take customer orders. The mid-shift you will help down stock the paint aisles, and help customers. If you are the closing shift you help customers, face the aisles, and get the dept ready for the opener the next day."
good,"Company has forgotten that it's great customer service that brings people back, they are in the process of eliminating experienced full-time associates and replacing them with inexperienced part-timers."
good,this is a big box company and Is not a personable place to work.  many employees are good people but most are there for a job and income and not a career.
good,A typical day at work was stocking up in the morning and doing sales during the day. I learned how to communicate with people better. I loved the culture of being able to initiate conversations with customers.
good,"I work here now and am not happy with the moral and attitude that has changed lately. There is no recognition for hard work. The ability to survive on the pay scale and even try to save for future, is just not there. There is consistent turn a round of staff due to poor management and no room to move up."
good,"The company itself is a great place. However , working there is not the best .  .The managers are not people friendly or helpful. Customers vary.  Never work there again."
good,"The more you learn and move up, the more stressful it becomes. No matter how well you do, they only expect more from you."
good,Collaborative work environment.  Company is very focused and methodical in their approach to everything they do.  You get to work on important projects that can result in major wins to the company.
good,"Once you've proven yourself to be reliable and willing to take ownership of the job you'll be asked to take on more responsibility."
good,Travelling to different stores and meeting new associates. Seeing different areas of North Carolina. Getting to know the corporate managers who were really laid back.
good,"Hardest part of the job was downstocking 5 gallon buckets of paint."
good,"Worked the customer service desk. Duties included answering phone calls and transferring to different departments throughout the store, processing returns, internet orders, and ringing up sales."
good,Good place good people. I had many jobs working here and have spent a total of four years working  here. I enjoyed most of the jobs I worked and enjoyed the people I worked with
good,"As a retail company sometimes busy season can be a little crazy, however pay is decent. Work culture isn't the best but it isn't the worst."
good,unorganized place to work...terrible management. I was hired to do one job and the job title changed on first day. Great rate of pay compared to competitors
good,"My experience at Lowe's HIW, Inc. was one that garnered myself a great deal of tangible work experience, team building, and the flexibility to manage a team within my own discretion. I learned, contributed, and fostered a great deal of knowledge, as well as having the autonomy to tailor learning objectives for my team. These objectives were driven by policy; but not limiting, thus I could tailor an individuals learning plan based on the company goals and their abilities."
good,I love driving so this position is pretty decent for me just have to becareful and i like it but if there are another opportunity out here i like i will take it but am also looking for an better job as well.
good,"If you love a friendly environment this place is for you. Great customer service and a great working place. A great place for fresh fruit and vegetables, we also carry Boars Head the best meat/cheese company."
good,"I started out loving Lowe's but as I advanced to a management position, it drained the life out of me. They expect WAY too much and offer little support. You run ragged most of the time and unless you are in a certain position, your hours are all over the place."
good,"Difficult company to work for, not enough help, only concerned with profits, wages low, safety culture a mockery, supervision not sufficient, only looking to eliminate workforce."
good,"Little to no work life balance."
good,"part time "
good,lowes is a good company. I didn't have any complaints. i was young and dumb. they have good benefits and a fast paced environment. i would have moved around if i was there there
good,"I love the customers and I enjoy working for Lowes.  The problem is the hours.  They are not guaranteed, it all depends on the store profit.  One week I could have 16 hours, the next 30.  Not consistant."
good,Started as cashier. Training for that was excellent. I was then moved to a different department (seasonal). Training there was horrible. I was given a book and expected to learn everything on my own. Did not give me time for school. Pay was good. But it was Biweekly pay. My availability was not followed. Poor work/life balance.
good,Lowe's in its self is a good company with some good policies in place. Just the people that I worked with were not the friendliest. The management team are well educated professionals. They know there stores and products surprisingly well.  The Lowe's team works like a fine tuned machine. If one associate can not help you there will be another than can. One thing that I did not like was being a seasonal employee you were stuck working all the hours that full time employees didn't want to work.  You were also stuck working every weekend.
good,"A typical day at work involves checking emails and voicemail."
good,The best part of working at Lowes is developing a great rapport and relationship with the customers. I have enjoyed working with some driven and talented individuals who strive to be their best.
good,They hired me then let me go a couple months later. It was a shady thing to do when they said I would move up in the company. A typical day would be easy. Management was shady but tolerable.
good,"Each location varies in its management and how the stores operate. There is alot of needed improvement, however it hasn't been trending in the right direction for correction."
good,I loved working for Lowe's but there was no career advancement. the management was the worst. There wasn't any since of control or anything. I had to get out of there and find something better.
good,I was seasonal help for this company. I loved to work outside and that's what the let me do. The management was good overall. They all worked together and communicated well. It was a good place to start out and meet new people in a new city. It was my first job after moving to Texas.
good,"Work changes day-to-day. I've learned to be as passionate, if not more than those I come in to contact with daily. I am a part of management but get those I manage to manage themselves. I love helping people love where they live, most difficult thing is will they let themselves be helped. I find the most enjoyment comes from helping either Customer or employee feel accomplished with there projects or tasks."
good,"A typical day for a night stocker is going in and staying busy stocking product onto shelves, and making sure that the departments you are assigned are ready to go when the store opens."
good,"I was a seasonal garden worker the was the lifter for all heavy things customers couldn't get. We used forklifts for fireplaces, fences or stone. During this time they had a deal for the mulch and everyone wanted it. I spent most of my time at the mulch section waiting for customers to come up with their cars showing me the ticket of how much they got and then load it into their cars. It was a vary exhausting job that had no time to stand around."
good,"Average job, it depends what your used to. They just did restructure of Management, attempting to put more part-time on floor with less leaders. Question is will all positions be filled, never seems to have enough help."
good,"Great people to work with worked with caring and giving group of people, the managers staff will listen to what the people have to say, and work to solve problems"
good,"Customers and some employees make the day enjoyable, but HR could be better. Iwhen it comes to health dental and vision care it is the best"
good,I love working with the customer and it help me learn more on the construction side.  The heat working outdoor lawn and garden wasnt my favorite but I did try my best
good,"Typical work duties included zoning department, downstocking, removing safety hazards before the store opened. If closing these duties would take place once the store is closed. Assisting customers and selling products. Ensuring products that are sold from stock are pulled and labeled and staged in the appropriate area. Work with minimal supervision duties are assigned by senior management. Hardest part is the heavy lifting which includes 50 pounds bags of mortar and grout, tile cartons that weigh up to 50 pounds or more. Enjoyable part is helping customers select a floor they will love and enjoy for years."
good,"The company is not bad as a whole, very slow to produce update software to perform day to day task. Still very very old school with huge amounts of paper work that can in 2017 be replaced with web base software. As most retail companies do more with less people is the way its trending."
good,"The store was fun to setup and be part of that environment. The management treated you like one of them, most of the time. It was great fun how all staff felt like family."
good,I enjoyed the work at Lowes.  There was sometimes difficulty getting issues resolved.  Most of the people there were nice.  I enjoyed working with the customers.
good,"My typical day at work is from 6 a.m - 3 p.m. I assist the Delivery Team with getting their deliveries together for the customers. I also assist other departments with whatever they need, after the deliveries have left the store. Management has gone through some changes lately but, they are still there when you need them. The workplace is a little uneasy now due to recent downsizing but, we all still do what we can to help each other on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication between departments. Being prior military, communication is key in every work environment. The best part of my job is the people I work with. I do my best to smile everyday and tell everyone ""Hello""."
good,"Working in the store isn't much change of scenery but we were very close working together and had opportunities to work with professionals of many fields, which required us to be very customer-orientated"
good,Seasonal Position was good a lot of hours but not much training. They drop you into the fire basically. Management was decent but not the best most of the employees had issues with management.
good,Started as a part time cashier and moved up to department manager in three years. They have good opportunitys for advancement.
good,Started out as a part time cashier and moved up to department manager in 3 years. Good place for advancement if you looking to make more money i a retail environment.
good,Had put in 11 years with this company and started from the ground up.  Was a nice place until all of the changes took place and the company started cutting very knowledgeable management staff.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes throughout the years. And when I first started, there were many advancement opportunities available. Then the downsizing started and opportunities faded. I would still recommend them as a place to work, but only if you are not looking for quick advancement"
good,"Answering phone calls, transferring phone calls, placing orders, and assisting customer needs. Good company to work for."
good,its alright people are good the hours are good just alittle stressful unloading floor loads according to the ty/hi dont see how they get what they get per row
good,"For the most part, a positive experience. Company offers a lot of benefits. Harder to get full time employment. People on the sales floor are good people to work with."
good,Cannot speak for the company culture. The store I worked in was getting by with a skeleton crew on a regular basis. It was difficult to know what was expected as I received a bare minimum of training. Sometimes found myself in a position of performing duties beyond what I understood my job description to be.
good,"customer focused every day"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of talking with my associates and relaying on to them daily sales numbers and sales goals. Then walking my areas for marketing and merchandising, giving direction to associates of opportunities that needed to be addressed and resolved."
good,"A company primed to succeed but oftentimes choses financial success over developing the good employees, keeping the great employees, and eliminating the terrible employees."
good,"helping customer find exactly what there looking for and then some makin sure the find and get everything they need, help customers with doors windows made keys cut carpet and finice differnt types of appliances"
good,"Not much to say, they were a good company steadily declining by cutting jobs, pay, hours and benefits. I really didn't find it to be a career job and never enjoyed it.The jobs was not hard and the workplace is boring. There is no way to improve ones ability nor work to the top because they hold you back, its a high-school job not something you find as a career."
good,Lowes is not a bad place to work for. You just have to do your work and keep your nose clean. Theres alot of people who are willing to get you in trouble for doing a good job just so they can have a leg up.
good,"good place to work overall. Retail is detail so hard work and specific processes must be followed. "
good,"I worked for Lowe's 16 years in varies stores and was laid off due to ""restructure"" of management at the store level."
good,"Although sometimes challenging, my job at Lowes was always rewarding. They give you the opportunity to grow in the company."
good,I have worked for lowe's for a while. Good place to work. People are very nice and its a fast paced environment. I have learned alot by working for this company.
good,Over all my time at Lowes was great. My co workers always made it better for me. Some issues were I was there for two years and had three store managers. No communication changes would come and you would just have to find out whenever.
good,Bad cooperate politics.  Some of the worst hours and scheduling I've ever seen.  However some of the best people on the planet to work with.  A real sense of family.
good,Typical day at work was managing the shipping and receiving area.  Learned a lot about managing people and the workplace culture was team oriented.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with customer issues and complaints but the most enjoyable part of the job was set hours and weekends off.
good,"Lowes culture has changed in not taking care of there associates, giving more work to there hard working associates. Not understanding its a team effort and not just taking advantage good working associates."
good,Weak management which shows in the corona location. Not a lot of opportunities to challenge or better yourself. If upper management feel threatened by you they will make your time there very difficult.
good,"I wasn't interested in this position, this job was just a means to get by. I do enjoy helping others while i was there and learning each department like flooring painting appliances."
good,I was worker in the outside garden as a temp but needed more permanent status so I moved into appliance sales. the expectations by the boss was ridiculous
good,Good Company to work for enjoyed my stay while I was there. Associates worked together to help take care of the customers.
good,a typical day at work. what I learned. management. workplace culture. the hardest part of the job. the most enjoyable part the job
good,It was lowes. I didn't mind helping out where ever I was needed. I just did not like having so many managers all the time. You never knew whom you were to report to.
good,Lowe's is a fast past work environment that requires you to be on your feet for the majority of your day. It takes hard work and dedication to excel and grow within the company but if can make it to the upper levels of management it will be worth the time and effort you put in.
good,I started at the bottom rung of this company ladder working part time a few days a week. I was able to take my hard work ethic and the knowledge given to me by my peers and work my way up to Asst. Mngr. in my ten years with the company. I was apart of many aspects of the day to operations and special projects over the years and happy to be to work for them. I unfortunately fell victim to a corporate restructure and was laid off.
good,"Wasn't a bad place to work, it just could have been better paying for the job you did, most days out in the hot sun lifting lots of heavy things for only minimal pay."
good,"Have a hard time finding mgmt. for help, mgmt. staff shows favoritism, the pay rate and hours are good.  Coworkers are fairly well to get along with. merchandise is a bit high priced but in the long run worth it. if things are not in stock then it can be ordered. sometimes it is hard to find an associate to help you on the showroom floor. they can be short-staffed at times as well"
good,Do not always earn what you should. Administration is to friendly with associates. Can move up in company if you are friends with the right people. Just be careful.
good,"I have worked with Lowe's for almost five years, so clearly there are many redeeming qualities about this company/job. However, I feel as an associate with this company for so long, that I've learned that employees are very under appreciated and over worked. Salary is great here, but they are beginning to restructure a lot of the company by eliminating positions and letting go of their qualified people just to save a few bucks. It's very discouraging to see this happen after working for them for so long."
good,They don't give you many hours and want you to be available for any hours they throw at you. They are not really willing to work with you much on scheduling issues and the like.
good,I like working at Lowe's because I have met some good people while working here and the HR Manager is very cooperative. I plan to keep this little part-time job for as long as I can.
good,"I was a member of the Lowe's management team for the past 14 years. I was let go because of restructuring of the staffing plan for the store I was in. I feel I had given the company all they asked for and more. I was read a scripted reason as to when I was not chosen to continue with the company and I quote "" You were not chosen because you do not align with the new direction Lowe's is going"". If you chosen to work for this company just know that hard work will be expected and make sure that everything you do you CYA yourself as you never know when you could be let go."
good,"Typical day was constant monitoring of the condition and service levels on the sales floor. Freight was a daily focus early as well as replenishment. Customer issues were a constant, mostly due to appliance problems. The workplace was safe and clean and teamwork was emphasized. The best part of the job was the people working there. The hardest was working a lot of closing shifts, which kept me away from home at night."
good,"Many great people working at Lowe's.  Compensation is more than fair.  Leadership is struggling, as a company, to find its role in home improvement.  Over 10 years there have been at least four different changes in Leadership as well as a company overhaul that has been ineffective."
good,Load and unload merchandise off truck and put freight where it belongs. The customers were friendly but some of the employees were lazy and would not come to work
good,Lowe's seems to want to do the right thing for it employees but sometimes looses sight of what is important.   Proper training and leadership sometimes get lost in the grand scheme of things.
good,Position does not exist any longer. Program was designed to increase the awareness of the Lowes Paint department to contractors in the area.  Difficult to build base with out leaving the building.
good,Lowe's is going through a reconstruction period. I am sure it will all work out but right now it is highly stressful. Overall not a bad place to work if you can deal with the hours.
good,"The job I had as an order picker was fairly straightforward and easy. A typical day had me staging order for delivery and spending the rest of my time in another department or pushing carts. I learned how to drive an order picker while employed. Management was competent, however I barely saw them due to my shift schedule and lack of hours. The hardest part of the job was having to stage orders on uncommon items. It was difficult to locate them due to the system the company used. The relaxed nature of the job was enjoyable, as well as the welcoming demeanor of the employees."
good,I liked working here because I've always been a people person. All in all it's a good place to work if you like being around people. The downfall is that you have to straighten the aisles of merchandise before you leave from your shift.
good,"Working at the pro desk itself was great but after 6 months or so, it was all about pro service sales numbers and credit card applications. "
good,"This company really pushes people to excel. they want people to make leaps and bounds in the workplace, assistant managers push the department managers and the store manager pushes the assistant managers."
good,"A typical work day I stood at the register, got yelled at for making to much noise, got yelled at for not standing still. Management did not care when someone did something inappropriate to you because ""your're just a cashier."" Co-workers were gossipy and never welcoming. The hardest part of the job was dealing with co-workers. The most enjoyable part was working with customers, even though sometimes there was a nasty one, and working with the few co-workers who had a good attitude."
good,"I loved my job and environment.  no job security.  there is talk about layoffs all the time.  I didn't listen to it for 2 years,  no they are laying off."
good,had it's ups and downs. Had a great time working on the floor versus cashiering when store first opened. Had the most fun working there when I was allowed to stock shelves and help customers find supplies they were looking for
good,"Long hours of strenuous work, for low pay is generally what you get here as an entry level associate. If you stay the course, it tends to workout in the long run."
good,It was a fun workplace.  I  liked the 15% off for employees. The coworkers where fun. High energy and I enjoyed that very very much.
good,"The people you work with are like family."
good,"Some of management was great others not so great. Raises are small and only annually, free lunches on holidays, co workers are friendly and helpful. Store is kept neat and clean."
good,It was fun to work at I do much miss it I enjoy the ppl I work with I left cause another employee offered me a job with more money I should never have took it
good,"This is an ok client to work for,not updated to latest technologies,"
good,Nothing special about this job. Very typical job perfect for those who are new to the labor force or have no dreams of growth.
good,No longer have the position. They came in and cut back every where they could including management. Great co workers and flexible hours.
good,"A typical day at Lowes as a Sales Specialists tends to be busy. Checking orders, calling customers, and selling product/service. I've learned a lot about sales and how to interact with customers. The management is awful. They aren't professional. Some of the coworkers are good and then some are terrible. Management picks favorites. I like the pay and the benefits. Many people use Lowes as a stepping stone for their career. High turnover rate."
good,Overall good entry level job. There is a lot you can learn if you prove yourself. I got moved around and worked in many departments. What I've taken away from Lowes is all department managers have something good to offer weather its tips and tricks or advise on seller. I sure learned a lot.
good,this was a good job fun experience workers and cutomers very polite still speak when i spoke by for a visit good hours and they work with your schedule
good,"Your typical day will entail loading and unloading cargo, assisting consumers, stocking, organizing, cleaning, and handling paperwork including but not limited to personal information. Management varies from store-to-store. Co-workers tend to be friendly and helpful. Lowe's tends to be a consumer-first organization and will bend its own rules and regulations to please consumers making work more difficult at times, but employees are generally rewarded for their efforts."
good,"If you love retail, this is a great opportunity to work and advance. Pay could be better with the long hours that are required to work."
good,"Quality employees are rarely recognized and turnover can be plenty. As the years go by, more and more responsibility is placed on employees with no added benefit to the employee. This is, of course, to please the stockholders and increase the stock price. By the way, most of what the CEO makes is in stock options. Lowe's has forgotten what really matters to people, getting adequate payment for services provided and advancement."
good,"Good people, opportunities for self development with courses you can elect to go to. Corporate office has an awesome walking trail.  Your role is often to stay within your swim lane and not necessarily challenging you in other areas."
good,Management did not truly care about the staff as much as they did about their numbers then it would truly be a prosperous company
good,"I currently enjoy working at Lowe's, but an event recently occurred that has me bothered. A friend, hard worker, loyal to Lowe's recently was terminated for a minor offense. I like my job, but there are employees who should have been terminated numerous times for more serious offenses. I now wonder about the leadership of this store and the Lowe's corporation as a whole."
good,"The company gives holidays and vacation even for part time, although you have to be there for 90 days.  It's a great place to work while you're in school."
good,Fun fast paced customer oriented and typical large retail store friendly co workers and generally efficient management
good,This job required a lot of manual labor. Contractors would come in and buy enough wood to build a house and sometimes I would have to get all the wood by myself.
good,"overall a very good place to work, unless your direct assisstant manager does not respect your ability. sometimes there is alot of micro-managing. the upper management can be very good. alot of the time the upper management does not wan to interfere with there assistants, in which there are many. use caution and ask alot of questions before you apply with them."
good,"Recruited for one position and hired, reluctantly for another that they wanted to 'try' out. It was a design position that I have no experience in and told them so"
good,Was able to gain some everyday knowledge on home improvement. Also learned that not everyone is going to give you a chance.
good,Good company and good pay but when they say they are going to promote from within for new job openings they just hire in people for the new positions anyways.
good,"Not my favorite job, not the worst. Just kind of in the middle. Nothing really stands out about the job or the workplace, both were fine."
good,"A typical day at work is fulfilling , fast paced everyday you wake up you get the chance to help others also you get to learn many things on the job that you might not have the chance to deal with on a regular"
good,"If you are into having a checklist to manage your checklist, then this is the place for you. This company will manage you out if you don't fit the mold and say sir to everything./"
good,"A typical day at work for me was walking around getting carts and being pulled and tugged constantly for various task which was a positive I don't mind lots of work it keeps me busy what i did mind though is that people got upset when i was needed for loading or carts and they couldn't find me because i was either on a break or helping other employees or just hanging out when there was a break in my work flow."
good,They would not work with you on your days and hours. They new my bus route and still hired me and expected me to show up and work later so I would miss my bus.
good,"I enjoyed my job until I got very sick and got 2 write ups when a doctor told me I couldnt work. Recieved my first write up, and then my 3rd. Was never given the second"
good,"Lowe's was a great place to work, the employees where fun to work with, helped teach me new jobs in the store and cross training me in the departments. The customers where nice friendly. Low's would have random days where they provided free lunches to the employees. The only problem I had was they cut my hours from 40ish to 16 without telling me about it before hand, then a couple weeks after they would put me on and take me off schedule the day before my shift, this went on for a month (a month of no pay) so I ended up talking to HR and the general manager. They put me on schedule and said that i will work it, same thing a day before that cut the hours again. I would go back in a heart beat, if i get a statement from them saying they wont do that again, and give me a set schedule."
good,I helped service customers finding items and purchasing items in the store. I also helped them load their stuff in their vehicle. I learned a lot about the many different departments in Lowes and how everything works and where to go to find certain items. Management tend to get overwhelmed and very lazy at times. The hardest part was being the do everything guy at Lowes. I felt like I always had to pick someone else's slack up or do someone else's job. The most enjoyable part was learning how to drive the equipment there and about the different departments in the store. I recommend this job for someone who is in between jobs and just needs or someone who is young and looking for a first job starter.
good,"Go in get the register ready for the day, start looking at schedule see who is coming in for the day look at report for special orders."
good,It is a typical retail setting where upward mobility is easy IF the managers and HR take a liking to you. Otherwise be prepared to stay in the same position for years or interview for years just to be turned down. The money is good for retail. Basically all the full time positions offered require an open availability that involves a rotating hour and days schedule.
good,"Lowes was a good clean and good atmosphere. Getting in there first thing make sure Iles are clean and stocked. I liked working there because it's good practice with people skills, learning how communicate with different customers."
good,It's OK to be there and easy going. The job is pretty easy. Managers are OK to talk to. The benefits are great. The hours are OK to work. They have OK luncheons. And the workers are fun to work with.
good,"A really supportive group of employees, that enjoys working with the customers. They lack training in every department. The hardest part of working there is, the fact Management schedules does not staff enough people to adequately support customers."
good,"There were not really ""typical"" days as there were always different needs around the store and I became the go-to guy for most departments. In over ten years of employment there, I had the opportunity to learn many things, including great customer service and the ability to work with people of all levels within the store. The hardest part of the job was sometimes having to multitask more than could be handled by one person and not able to give the highest quality service. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people and customers."
good,I don't want to. I am not doing this review by choice. the people that work their are nice. the management is really kind. mostly part time work however
good,LIked my co workers. We all got a long great.Everyone knew everyone and we all got along. We all worked together no matter the day
good,its very busy in season and when we aren't in season. I learned a lot about paint and the company.the hardest part about the job is having angry customers. the most enjoyable is being able to work and help people with their paint projects.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to identify your customers needs and being able to provide solutions for their individual needs based on product knowledge.
good,"The day is spent standing at the front of the store greeting customers, processing transactions, and answering questions. I learned a bit about home improvement from just being a cashier. Co workers are generally friendly. The hardest part is dealing with rude customers"
good,"I had great first impressions of the job and management, but after a few months the pleasantness of the environment declined due to management personalizing my actions."
good,as a seasonal employee that i was there were many friendly people to work with and most customers were great to. learned alot about the business and how to take care of your own home
good,I learned to run a forklift and different saws while there.  I worked front end loader and in the building supply area mostly.  The management was not good at all.  They would change your schedule and not even call you and you may come in to work and work 8 hours and not even suppose to be there or they would put you on the schedule and you  wouldn't know it.  It was crazy everyone was running around to different departments and not knowing what to do.
good,"your work tasks vary depending on your time of day. Mornings to evenings can be pretty steady as with most businesses but the late evening to night is where things slow down. You will have days where you have to stock and its busy or vice versa. It all depends."
good,This was my first job working with lawn & Garden supplies it was very interesting my coworkers where helpful. Gave me a chance to operate forklifts & order expicker
good,I start at 4am. Managers and direct co workers are great to work along side. Some employees and management can over exaggerate. The customers at this specific location are sometimes more frustrating then other locations I have worked at.
good,Retail can be both stressful and rewarding. I love the people I work with but management can lacking at times. There are plenty of opportunities for improvement here but also some really great aspects.
good,Depending on what store you work for and how high a volume store they are depends on how much physical and demanding work will be expected from you . I transferred from a low volume store to a high volume store. So much more demanding force is expected from you . Not for the slow or weak at heart for not being told how good of a job you are doing. Because you wont find that here.It all depends on the store and the management as bad as that sounds. They have great benefits and insurance but you pay the price for the work schedule rotations if you are full time.
good,Has great hours and the work is easy. I would go back if given the chance. Very friendly place and easy to find. Lots of room for growth.
good,Fun place to work. Customers sometimes demanding. Management can be wishy washy in treatment of employees. Human resources sucks
good,"Better than most retail stores but most people aren't there to help you since they are nowhere to be found, they don't really tell you anything and they'll change you're position out of nowhere."
good,they are working at the capacity of a family like unit. they try to help one another in and out of the work place. everyone tries to get along and its also spanish as well as english speaking so that there isnt any miscommunications
good,Pretty good job but I would really like a job dealing with music. I love the people there but I am tired of working in a grocery store. I have been there 5 years but I want to do something dealing with my major in college.
good,"Lowes is a good company to work for, A lot of the people I met there are great hard working employees w/ great personalities. Schedules are a downer, because they'll switch everything up on you at the last minute. Then blame you for not knowing schedule were changed."
good,"Good company, and benefits but needs more communication and consistency. I have worked with Lowes fore many years and I see how procedures come and go it would be nice for consistency however not a bad company to learn retail!"
good,I loved this job at first due to the steady work and mentality and after 30 days notice of vacation and approval for my family emergency they threatened my job for staying for the store needs. I am obviously not happy with this company but with the great people there it's honestly just a disappointment.
good,"IT is driven by very strong top down style, if anyone wants to implement a change from the front lines, it is a very difficult and slow process to implement a changes or introduce a new technology from the bottom up."
good,I really do not wish to write a review. I work at Lowe's only because it has a higher pay than most places where I live. I do not like the hours or rotating shifts. I do like the people that I work with and like the managers that I work for.  All in all it isnt the worst place to work.
good,"prepare foods, handle cash drops, handle front counter, cook foods, prepared salad, handle cash transactions, handle customer orders, handle set-up that cooking lines,  make sandwiches, make speciality salads, answered the phones, restock items, collect out-of-date items also tag items with the right prices , handle shrink at record, and run a register and etc."
good,This was a fun place to work at. I worked there while I was in school and they were really flexible with my school schedule. The typical day included helping customers and closing the store down by replacing inventory from the shopping day.
good,"not a horrible place to work, management could use a little work, hardest part was working in areas you know little about"
good,"Lowe's is a decent company to work for. I have been with the company for many years and have taken advantage of some of the benefits they offer, including tuition reimbursement."
good,"You get to know ppl from around the world, experience a great foundation to the start of a bright future. There are some exclusions, but in the end they are good people."
good,"Is a good place to work for it. job security, a lot to learn very friendly, very positive, easy to move up in another position."
good,There is not much I can say about this company. The work that I did there was very cut and dry as a typical sales job. I am looking for other opportunities.
good,"Lowe's was a very hard place to work for, and I do think it had a alot to do with Re-Model and new management. But my co-workers were awesome and I got the complete training I needed to do my job properly."
good,"I would recommend it to anybody. very laid back place, the workers are very boring. very meeting you food, clean place, very safe place"
good,"Working at lowes was a tough physical job for me since I work in the lumber department had to push carts in, cut wood for customers, and also restock heavy items on the rack."
good,"Lowe's, like other major retailers have changed their focus from enough coverage to cover all departments to bare coverage so that fewer employees to cover several departments, leading to customer frustration of not being able to be waited on and the employee's frustration of not being able to help, adequately, the customer's needs. This leads to having the customer leaving to go to on line or another location."
good,"A typical day at work would include sometimes stocking merchandise, helping customers to load merchandise, and gathering carts from the parking lot when the demand for a loader was low. I learned how frustrating it can be when people don't listen to you as far as needing help to satisfy a customer. Most of the co-workers were alright to work with but there were a few, mostly management, that acted as if I should know where everything was even though items were constantly being moved around to comply with corporate's demands. The hardest part of the job was finding help to fulfill large or heavy orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a customer was understanding and thanked you for your help."
good,"bussy but worth it, made the day go by fast. I learned a lot about tools.. co workers fun and helpful. Dealing with upset customers. I enjoyed the customers because most of them were old and nice.."
good,"The hours were decent, pay was good, and the work wasn't very hard. Overall I really loved the people I worked with. I would recommend working here. I enjoyed it."
good,A typical day at work consists of clocking in and helping customers to the best of my ability. Whether it means pointing them in the right direction to what they need or some advise on their project or even just a friendly conversation and small talk. I've learned about some home improvement repairs such as dealing with light fixtures and dealing with plumbing issues. Most enjoyable is being able to make someones day at the register :)
good,"Okay, if you're planning on working at Lowe's as your first job from high school or college, cool try it out. If it's going to be your 2nd or 3rd job, I'd recommend you look some place else for a job. No offense. "
good,"The National Guard was fun but not much learning. I did not do much training, most soldiers were lazy or untrained. My boss was excellent, he ensured I was always doing something during drills."
good,"the job is very laid back, isn't very busy, slow income so it will be hard to make sure the credit card quotas are made, but very easy job to find things an help customer with there purchuse"
good,they have several shifts through out the day so it was easy to change a shift to accommodate schooling and usually had steady hours
good,"Lowes has a very fun atmosphere inside the building everyone is accepting, friendly and always willing to help out. Cash is a great place to start with lowes as a new employee or if you are freshly employed. Cash however is fast paced, but it helps make a long shift seem shorter."
good,"Each day was challenging/rewarding meeting needs of cashiers and customers. The job is to keep cash registers and customer service programs running smoothly and efficiently, proactively resolving issues. Unfortunately, in my store the cashiers deal with a lot of ridicule and blatant favoritism, to the point of harassment/discrimination. I believe management is aware but looks the other way. Information/training in my department was not sufficient/grudgingly doled out.  "
good,"I started as a cashier in 2008, became a head cashier after two years and left Lowe's as an Installed Sales Coordinator. I really enjoyed Installed Sales. Working one on one with customers who purchased items that needed installation.  It was exciting working with them from start to finish. I was also responsible to resolve any issues that arose from the installation."
good,"Busy store especially summer."
good,Its a decent job as long as you keep up with the ever changing management. Lot of turn employee turn over. They seem to keep the bad ones and get rid of the good employees.
good,Pay and schedule are good. I enjoy my job and have a great relationship with my coworkers. I've learned quite a bit while working for Lowe's.
good,I love what I did. The residents was so cool to work with. They taught you things. I love the passion of helping of people. I love what i do.
good,The company culture really shines out at the Oswego Lowes.  Everyone knows everyone kind of atmosphere and the customers are usually great to deal with there too.
good,"A typical work day for me at Lowes was me working on the cash register, helping customers find merchandise or helping them build something."
good,"putting away new product from the recieving dock and replenishing pick locations.also taking care of anything that arise throughout the day learned the importance of distribution centers.were not the best managers i have come in contact with showed favortism to some employees. i enjoyed working with my team members. the hardest part of the job was trying to understand what the managers was thinking, playing pool and getting a paycheck."
good,"It's an ok job if you need summer work or a little extra cash. Pay isn't that great, around a low level office job. Don't count on bonus checks if you're seasonal however. They'll promise the ability to advance but don't count on it. Myself along with several others were promised full time (38-40 hours) but ended up only getting 30 hours a week. Make sure when you apply you can work 10 hours less than they promise. Employees are pretty nice. Customers are 50/50. They say they'll work with your schedule but keep an eye out for ""mistakes."" Several if us have to have corrections done on a weekly basis. Everyone including the managers plays pokemon go so expect phones to be seen a lot even on the floor."
good,"Each day could be a different shift."
good,"Not a real post. Not a real post. Not a real job. Not a real post. System thought it was a job, but it is not so sorry you have to read this. Not a real post."
good,"poor payscale, no raises. management did not want to promote from within. they did not pay attention to associates. no development. friendly asscoiates."
good,Customers are great that came in. Learned their way of sales. Management was there to help when needed. Co-workers were there also if you had questions or needed a hand loading inventory or finding things for a customer.
good,The store works great as a team together. Learned how to work well with others and learned a lot about home improvement and customer service.
good,I don't have anything good or bad to say about the company other than it was time to move on when I left. I still have people I know that work there and they still seem to like it ok.
good,"The boss was awesome but I had not the funnest time but the pro team is lazy and since I worked their I had to pull everyone's weight. However, I learned so much from the job. This is why I'm giving it 3 stars because I feel like I have learned enough to make it worth my time there."
good,most enjoyable was working with the customers and some very nice co-workers job not hard a typical day of 5- 8 hrs days learned alot about plants
good,"I enjoyed working at home depot, I learned a lot about flooring, garden and lumber.  I also was able to learn how to drive around machinery and help down stock merchandise.  I did not stay because I wanted to be full time and they did not have that position."
good,Nice place overall. Little to no air conditioning. Sweating all the time. Good training and feedback. Requirements are clear and you know what to expect
good,I don't think it was fair when it came to having seniority for two years. Then a position comes up and they hire someone off the streets.
good,receiving good in all through out the day and packaging and rerouting pallets to outbound or in warehouse.
good,"Typically, I walk around and assist customers in various departments and try to help those departments with tasks that they may be working on."
good,"Great place of work but very fast pace. The hardest part of the job was needing help to lessen lines and some of the other cashiers took their time or stepped away from their registers too often,"
good,I enjoyed working at Lowe's for 3 years. I was able to learn more about home improvement and develop skills that have helped me with the current job I have.
good,Overall a good place to work . Enjoy helping all customers. Worked as sales specialist in millwork department my first year.
good,Lowe's is a very productive company to work for the staff is awesome and makes you feel like you're at home. Also the environment is great. Very friendly and great company to work for very flexible with scheduling.
good,Working at Lowe's can be stressful but this job has also given me the ability to work under pressure and keep calm in stressful situations. My ability to multitask has also improved as a result of this job as well as being able to recognize when multitasking might not be beneficial. My co-workers have gotten me through everyday in the work place and I have always said I was lucky to have the management that I do because not every company has managers that are so personable and easy to talk to.
good,"I would start off each day by loading the delivery trucks at 5 am. When I finished loading, I would start working on all orders for the next day. I operated all types of forklifts, and pallet jacks. Management were helpful and did not make you feel intimidated. Co-workers were friendly, helpful, and a delight to work with."
good,A typical day at work is very productive. I am always learning new things and  to help me to do my job more efficiently and serve customers better.
good,There is always something that goes wrong because everything can not stay good for too long. Management has lost control.
good,it was a good place till I transfer to another store the then the store manger was rude and un fare getting blame for other people mistake loaded delivery truck and got delivery ready
good,Worked at Lowes part time for about two years. Good people to work with. They seem to have a high turnover of personal. Good for a starter job or something part time.
good,Fast paced days depending on store. Teaches you to self educate yourself on products and customer service. Advancement based on location.
good,"some good people, but some annoying managers.  Workers of all ages, from teens to 60s+.  Creates a unique culture.  Involves a lot of walking, as they expect the younger workers to move around more"
good,"early years were employee oriented and above average work environment. later years insufficient staffing and inconsistant management made getting tasks completed very difficult. Benefits were cut, insurance limited. Job security became non-existant due Mgmt cutting payroll. However I did like most of the people I woked with. I also learned how to operate different types of lift equipment ."
good,Lowes is a good company and I enjoyed working with My co-workers.  the hardest part is dealing with unruly customers.
good,"A typical day at work for my would consist of opening the store prior to customer open to scan for inventory and pricing discrepancies in need of attention and run the reports to have the ready for the individual departments to complete during their day.  Then I would move back into the receiving area where I would organize and process returns that had been either processed by the returns desk or by company associates.  I would contact vendors schedule inspections and handle any issues needing attention in regard to equipment buyback material, hazardous materials, product repairs and vendor store pick ups.  Once those duties where completed I would move back onto the sales floor to help the individual departments with the correcting of their pricing and signage where needed, answering phones throughout the day unloading and receiving trucks as well as processing daily paper work and invoices."
good,"Some days weren't too bad but only having a few associates in the store on a busy day was not very fun. However, talking to customers and helping them was fun and rewarding."
good,At Lowes its great place to work. great co workers and great customers mgmt. always there to help when in need typical work day is always customer service driven and with them we would not have a pay check
good,"I worked for Lowes for 15yrs. never been in any trouble. I did what i was expected to do even more. A few years back we got a new Manager and the store moral went down. Everyone was on pin and needles not knowing what to expect."
good,job was okay. too much inner drama going on and I do not deal with things like that. but overall it was fun at times. nice area to work in
good,great place to work there . i just feel its time to move on. i get along with everyone of my coworkers and when I'm out on the sales floor i like customers with there purchase makes me feel good helping people out
good,Good first job or extra part time job. Expect changes often. Expect low hours if part time over the winter. Best benefit I had was employee discount and getting things that were going to be thrown out.
good,"Store is fair, foot traffic is light, very clique and store personnel seem content with the status quo, A former firm employee, many changes are obvious in the facility, variations of differing significance."
good,I only worked over one summer. My direct supervisor (lumber and building materials department) was great and a hard worker. The job was physically draining and had to deal with some interesting customers. I felt that the place was frequently understaffed due to corporate hour restrictions but I did enjoy working with my coworkers. They taught me a lot about an industry I was unfamiliar with.
good,"I worked at Kohls for nearly three years, and somewhat enjoyed my time there. The pay was definitely not worth the struggles of working retail, and there wasn't very many opportunities for me to advance through the company via new jobs."
good,some what confuseing at times with manegment. other than that ok .I do assembly and most of the time people who work in other areas come and borrow tools and dont bring them back !
good,"Start out as a seasonal associate, do a good job you likely to get on permanent as a part time associate, great benefits, pay and good management."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the working experience in Lowe's and learning the ordering and sales numbers side of a large company, but the only downside is the constant turnover rate of employees.  The pay here is not the greatest in the world, but overall the company is a fun place to work."
good,"very busy all the time receiving and stocking for next day"
good,depending on who your boss is it could be great or terrible. Store managers need to be managed better. Lots of oversight by Market level folks with no accountability for Store managers.
good,"Great place to work, great people, and great pay . They offer a variety of benefits, and even paid vacation for part-time associates."
good,good pay for college students. fun environment. easy advancement. loved management. hiring process was fast. staff was friendly.
good,benefits are great by pay is low they teach you about products sold by companys  great learning experience the hardest part of the job is the long hours of work
good,Great Company to work and grow with. I began my career as a cashier and through hard work and dedication was able to excel into Senior Management.
good,"Great place to work, could use some minor adjustments as far as training."
good,The majority of the sales force got along and looked out for each other. I was impressed with the customer service that we were asked to give and did.
good,"Team members are hard working and want to do the right thing. Coaches at night work very hard with each other and to work with each department to assure that there a good work flow. Being nights, turn over is always a challenge, I have learned to adapted as well still achieve our daily goals."
good,"Average work experience but retail just does not suit me. Staff in general seem to do what they can as a whole. Receiving has good hours, and I am comfortable with the job."
good,Sell merchandise. Product variety. Capable management. supportive assistance. Amount of work to pay. Helping customers find their proper products.
good,"Fun and great place to work with the possibilities for advancement in other opportunities in other areas. I learned about handling landscaping and co-workers likes and dislikes."
good,it ok place it nice places to  start off nice cowork but managment is ok learn how to work with customer and it a very busy places so need help more than one customer
good,Overall good company to work for. Many great opportunities to move up in the company. Also a very good work environment.
good,"I worked here for 5 years and while they worked with me through my medical problems, it wasn't my favorite. The work got old quickly and the atmosphere wasn't the best."
good,"Typical day was pretty much all the same, doing my job  stocking and customer service .The hardest part of the job was being short handed alot."
good,"Aún hay areas de oportunidad por mejorar para fortalecer la cultura en la empresa."
good,Good part time work and wages were decent for the average single person. Met some great people and learned forklift operation.
good,"I worked there part time for some time, and the while the job itself wasn't bad, the pay was not great.  Had fairly good hours considering it was part time."
good,"Great place to work for pays fair, customers are nice, employees and management are friendly. Usual customers that come in and ask for your help makes you feel good. Great hours, and its the best company i have worked for so far as far as benefits."
good,"The primary function of the Customer Service  Manager (CSM) is to oversee store programs through effective delegation and management of work, employees, time, and resources, including securing appropriate staff coverage and assisting in the recruitment/selection processes. This also includes overseeing the opening and closing procedures in the store, overseeing Every Single Customer that checked out , offered speedy check out to our Customers also handling cash deposits and outflow for a multimillion dollar business, and ensuring store compliance with all safety procedures. Also responsible for increasing sales and maximizing profit margins through forecasting, sales reports, store promotions/programs, and managing inventory."
good,"Enjoyed my coworkers and management, I learned how to keep calm in stressful situations and make orders for out of stock products."
good,"My leadership style is one of servant leadership.  I have worked in regional retail, where I have had multiple store responsibility, and 10 years in Distribution Centers.  The HRM position here at Lowe's is very administrative, but none the less I love the people.  I wish there were more time to mentor and coach the up and coming Department Mgrs, and ASMs,  as they are starving for methods, best practices, and ways to grow their people, and the business."
good,"Overall Lowe's is a decent place to work. Quality of management varies by location, but in my experience was fairly adequate. They are generally willing to look out for their underlings, but will oftentimes pile work-loads unreasonably high (this is usually due to under staffing). Policies can be a bit rigid, and inventory management is a complete JOKE. Merchandise simply goes missing, and their incompetent distribution center almost never sends merchandise when they are expected to. This can subsequently lead to plenty of headaches when doing inventory counts and selling to customers. "
good,"A typical day at work included: cashing out customers, assist customers throughout the store and answer any questions or concerns, reposition the products in an organized manner, clean your work area (sweeping floors and cleaning countertops).  Whiling working at Lowe's I learned to have patience with the customers no matter the situation.  Management was very helpful and answered any questions or concerns any employees or customers had.  My co-worker were very fun to talk to and also helpful.  They made the long days go by a little faster.  The hardest part of the job was being in the lumber department because I had little knowledge on what specific items were called.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to go outside in the garden center on a nice day and watering/ rearranging the plants."
good,management over is is just chaotic and disorganized often double or even triple working and under appreciated the best part of the job is the customers sometimes make you feel special or important
good,"fast pace, customer oriented multitask move around a lot cover other departments pull orders for customers. put up stock and clean the store."
good,Multitasking a must. Met many interesting people. competitive pay.fair benefits. Wonderful hr associate willing to help whenever possible.Advancement opportunities possible. Always something to learn.
good,"Everyone is very helpful to one another. Great managers, employers and the customers are the best. I enjoy going to work everyday just for the customers. I get to put a smile on people's faces when they least expect it."
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for if you're looking for a place to build a career. My only quips stem from my personal experience with managers associated with the store I worked at.
good,"Your goal is to accomplish tasks in a timely manner, but you also want to have fun. Positive work environment and great fellow employees"
good,"It was a nice place to work. You are just a number at the end of the day, at some point your number will run up. There are favorites there with the coaches, and management above them. It was great while it lasted."
good,"Coach's essentially spent no time overseeing the work of their own shifts and there is no ability to insure each shift did or will finish their completed work. Contradictory emphasis given to what the company wants, and how they want it accomplished. (work faster, be safe, produce more, don't get hurt)"
good,"Lowe's provides a wonderful opportunity to learn new skills, and advancment in the company. A typical day involved inventory managment, customer service reguarding multiple areas of household maintenance, and upgrades. As a part of the Plumbing Department I learned many different areas of the trade, including the proper codes for the area, formulas for installing irrigation systems, and ""roughing-in"" the plumbing for a new house. The staff at Lowe's provided a fun work environment, and helped out where needed. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out what kind of plumbing was done in a customer's house when they did not bring the pieces in to compare. The most enjoyable part was laying out the set-up of what a customer needed to do to fix their problem, and having them come back in to show me they did it successfully."
good,"selling all kinds of doors and lumber ,, and plumbing ,, flooring ,,, every day ,, also ring on a cash register ,, stocking also"
good,Great place to work.  Many opportunities to advance yourself into other job areas.  The management at my store was fun and cared for the personnel and the company.  Glad to have participated in building out store within the District from the bottom to the Top Store and each employee received $1000 bonus.  I had only one complaint with a bad apple manager who was not a very nice person to the employees.  I resigned because store was too far out and our great store manager moved to Winchester store.
good,The management is not concerned with promoting the qualified candidates but instead showing personal favoritism. Co-workers can be under undo pressure because of this.
good,"if you are looking for a part time job or just got out of school, it's a good place to start. Pay is ok and mag seems to know what is going on. Unless you want to run a store, short term it's good."
good,"not great on pay what so ever. People are extremely nice and great place to work. Never a steady work hours, but easy simple work. Long hours of constant standing no sitting down allowed which can hurt feet sometimes."
good,"great employees"
good,"At Lowe's I am able to and continue to develop a skill-set which allows me to work with others to complete any task, problem solve, and maintain my workload in a timely manner. A typical day involves preparing daily shipment orders so that each can be loaded and transported to their destination. I have learned how to do this effectively and very efficiently. I am a team player, so I get along with everyone; ensuring that our team drives towards the finish line. The hardest part, but most rewarding part of this position is working with others and learning the different personality types."
good,"It was a good job and I learned a lot about Patio blocks, Soils and mulch and plants. There is in depth training before you are put in your department. I enjoyed helping people by answering their questions or giving them ideas. The hardest part was dealing with people that thought you were their servants and treated you like you were beneath them."
good,"great co-workers, management not up to par. Love the customers and solving their plumbing problems or helping them with their projects."
good,"learn about washers and dryers,heating and cooling,working with people who have the wisdom and knowledge about building materials,no job to hard to handle and getting to know the new parts of town"
good,"good benefits, opportunities to advance, cross training, hands on supervision"
good,Fast moving and can be rewarding. Always enjoyed working with my customers. Would have liked to have made a better income after so many years of work. Company seems to still be more male oriented on the pay scale. Lowes offered great training to their employees. I always felt confident in the products I was selling.
good,i liked working here however it had its stressful moments. Not enough staffing due to hours which were based on how much the big wigs wanted for their pockets.
good,"As a part time employee it was great being able to go to school during the week and work on the weekends. Typically work would consist of me walking the sales floor interacting with the customers providing help and opinions on products. With that being the entirety of my time I learned a lot about various element of home repair, such as different types of lightning. And that was all due the great help of my coworkers, they welcomed me showed me the ropes as some may say. The hardest part for me was standing on my feel for those eight hour shifts. Again the most enjoyable part of the job were the customers. Everyday it was someone new with a new home improvement project and it was exciting knowing my opinion could possibly make its way into the final project."
good,"A well structured institution that can lead its workers to many possibilities both inside and out. If you need a place to start a career, start with Lowes."
good,I enjoy the job for the most part it's just no advancement. I would refer anyone to Lowe's but employees that come I teach and show how the job is suppose to be done.
good,"You run into the same problems and good points as you would at any box store. Bad managers/good managers, good/bad customers, it's all the same."
good,Solid foundation as internet grows so does the supply chain business we need to challenge our customers as our empoyees
good,"one of the first people in the doors in the moring always good morning from all and to ll. learned a lot on customer service being in many different homes a day delivering item all over the city, all the bosses are friendly easy to talk to and go to with any issue or concern. the only part of my job id wish you change you be the other people on the road to many people like to cut off 24ft box trucks loaded down other than that i enjoy what i do just not what i want to do as a career."
good,work hard lifting to much weight 70lbs and no compensating for major doctor appts like cancer related surgery related need more pay for unloading semi trailers by hand
good,Lowes  is very hectic at times. I feel alot of times you are working about 3 different postions inside one. I have to be honest. I have learned  not everything is all business there. Actually it's mostly personal.My management I really don't want to touch that subject. My co workers though are what get me through my days. After being there six years I have truly gained another family. We all go through the same struggles. The hardest part of my job is being the only fulltime person in my department and that I have no growth there. The most enjoyable part to my job is helping my customers in a timely manner and seeing them walk away with a smile on their face.
good,Can be a good place to work for anyone looking for part-time work. Not a lot of training given which can make certain tasks intimidating. Co workers are the best part of the job. There are a lot of managers it can be confusing who you should listen to and job expectations are not very clear. Pay is bad for what you're doing.
good,Lowes was a family friendly place to work that was primarily a customer service focused company. I enjoyed my time there.
good,Have you ever worked in a retail place in which the store manager never has to work closing shifts. Everyone in a management position including HR should be required to work at least two closing shifts every week. This store manager is very moody and most of the time not genuinely friendly. Also takes a lot of weekends off. A lot of assistant store managers do little work and stay on their cell phones.
good,"I enjoyed my job, I enjoyed working with customers, answering phones, filing paper work, cleaning, and the different tasks that we had a day. Enjoyed the hours and most of all the people.. Management was very unorganized, and had a lot of favoritism. Hardest part of the day was having nothing to do."
good,the management was very strict. very corporate-like feel. horrible hours. the lumberyard associates are extremely under payed. lots of room to advance. managers definately showed favoritism.
good,"Training is pretty much non existent, management typically only cares about what you've done for them lately and change their minds on what needs to be done on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is keeping your mindset in a healthy place. The most enjoyable part about the job is meeting the different people and learning about how to do certain projects."
good,A typical day for me consisted of loading customers products and maintaining the quick load area. Management didnt always adequately staff the lumber area. my lumber co-workers were fantastic always helpful.
good,great customers can bring a lot to the table wherever I may be hired I am a very friendly and hard working reliable woman have experience in several different dept's  will be an asset to the company that hires me
good,"i learned how to assist customers, how to down stock merchandise, look for items, and also learned about the tools I was selling, the managers were good to work with and my coworkers were great"
good,"Every day was different.  During the first 8-9 years of my career was the best as we worked for managers who cared about work/life balance, your opinions,  and helped develop the skills needed to be successful.  After that, it seemed like everyone was out for themselves and never cared to take the time for the associates.  Lowe's did have a good compensation plan for its managers that included matching 401k plan and stock options. I made some friendships along the way, and some I still keep in contact with to this day."
good,good place to work at for very little pay and sometimes very bad management and could have more better people skills on a day to day basis
good,Salary is less comparable compared to other companies unless you are on the district level.  Employee moral tends to be lower store to store because of the pay scale.
good,I got along with my co-workers. I never had any problems with anyone. The hardest part of the job when you were new at it. I did got the chances to learn new things like unloading trailers.
good,if you like working with kids. You might like working here. Its a temporary position of you are a collage student. High students can work too. you will tutor 6-8th grade kids
good,"Great place to work"
good,Working at Lowe's has been quite an experience... I have learned a great deal about retail and being a supervisor. I enjoy the fast paced environment.
good,"It wasn't always this way, but the hardest part of my job is coming to work.  I love my coworkers, my customers, and what I do.  Unfortunately I work at a location that is just falling apart.  Most of the new hires just come to work for a paycheck and do not care about the job.  The management staff provide little to no assistance and the HR manager is a joke.  Lowes' new slogan is ""help customers love where they live"" which is wonderful, but how can anyone do that if they do not love where they work?  Things are changing (slowly) for the better, but we have a huge competitor moving just up the road and it just may be a little too late for change.  With all con's there are also pro's.  Lowe's has provided me a full time job for many years.  They were also supportive when I chose to go back to school and when I had major changes in my personal life.  The benefits are mediocre and the pay is average, but for a college student or someone seeking a seasonal job this is a great opportunity."
good,"Lowe's as a company will save money to help stock holders at any cost. They will change the title of a position (even though the job tasks and expectations are exactly the same) so they can drop the wage. They will cut hours even thought sales increase. The management will not help on the floor even though there may only be four or five associates. The few good things about Lowe's is their benefit package, scheduled breaks, and lunches, holidays,  paid sick days for part time and full time employees. "
good,"Lowe's was fun, the coworkers were always nice and easy to get along with. Managers could benefit from learning that there is always more than ONE type of person in the world. Being bilingual I felt discriminated against and was not able to show my full potential"
good,Everyone should not be in customer service. Honestly it is not the customers but the people they you are working with. Working with a good team is the key to success.
good,"Good atmosphere, varied schedule, minimal hours, co-workrers, courteous, management knowledgeable, Challenging to get full time hours, frequent employee turnaround. Could improve in some areas in training, motivation for advancement. Im short, good company, good wage, lack hours for living wage."
good,"Loved working with the customers, and being involved in something I was highly knowledgeable about.  It was also great working in the outdoors."
good,Decent for temporary employment. Management is bearable but one must be clear in availability. Sometimes they do not follow your schedule
good,My favorite part of my job is interacting with lots of different people. I work as a business partner to the store manager to run the store.
good,"Easy work place, good associates, and decent pay for the area. Needs better HR though. Good job security depending on what you're  hired for."
good,"Great place to work, always stayed busy and active. Pay was nice, raises were as well. Managers we extremely helpful and always lending a hand in tasks. Was nice to see for a change."
good,cashier. ive had to learn the system pretty much by myself. management is good. they wont hire full time. love my job. coworkers are pleasant for the most part
good,"Lowes Varies from year to year, store to store, and manager to manager. It can have its great times but remember it still is retail so it can't ever be too great."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty interesting. It may be a call out, a rebellious cashier or an angry customer. I've learned that with whatever could or does go wrong, try to stay level headed and smile. One minor situation shouldn't ruin the great customer service that will be delivered to the next customer. Some of my coworkers make it easy to get through. I feel the management could be a little more involved but with myself being a manager, I have the attributes and skills to keep my team engaged and focused."
good,"A typical day at work is usually fast paced"
good,good company good pay little support co workers inter action okay via chat handling customer inquires while in store was the hardest
good,"Lowe's has a fast paced work environment.  Employees have to remain focused and energetic, if so, individuals will enjoy their time there."
good,"A typical day depends on if you're closing or opening. I was usually opening, so with doing such you have the IEPs that have to be done. The IEPs is essentially product that has either been bought and the area it was in is empty. Or the product is missing. My job was to replenish the empty holes. This was done every morning. I learned how to deal with customers, how to speak and handle them in certain situations."
good,"Lowes Home Improvement is an okay place to work. I've learned a lot within the ten months I have been employed there like receiving packages, scanning merchandise, and inventory. The co workers  are friendly for the most part and the managers are too."
good,"From pulling orders for contractors, or filling the lumber aisle; I am either operating the forklift to do this or I am walking around with customers helping them with there projects"
good,Job was fast-paced and enjoyable. Set hours and days which worked well for me to coordinate with school. Managers did not communicate well with each other and what one expected or told you wasn't necessarily what the one on duty the next day or time expected.
good,"since I closed the store most of the time, my typical day at lowe's was helping customers and get ready to close the store and that alone took hours during spring and summer. My co-workers were great I enjoyed working there because of them"
good,"I was fortunate to be promoted twice within 6 months and learned a lot from my experience at this corporation.  It was a very busy place to work; but, overall, I enjoyed working with my co-workers, and sub-contractors."
good,"Great place to work, but you do not get enough break time. The work is physically demanding but I worked with great employees."
good,load and unload trucks of product and also water plants and helping customer find the product they are looking for and are having trouble finding
good,"A Lowe’s sales associate stocks shelves, maintains the sales floor, and assists store patrons with exceptional customer service. As a major hardware store chain, Lowe’s needs associates for a number of different departments, such as paint, carpet, gardening, lighting, and many other departments. Sometimes, and depending on the location, a sales associate with Lowe’s must perform other duties for the store, such as cashier and warehouse work."
good,"One of the things that I really loved about Lowe's were the people that I worked with.  Everyday I got to be with great friends and awesome customers.  Managers gave minimal training, just about everything is learn on the job.  On top of that they expect outstanding numbers with little pay."
good,"This job wasn't what I expected at all. Wasn't enjoyable at all, only good thing about the job was my co-workers. I wish I never took that job in the first place."
good,its a nice place to work.upper management cares a lot about customers .I would  recommend this company . typical retail hours.
good,It was a learning experience. I got more knowledge (know-how) on how to fix basic household damages. Managing at Lowes gave me more perspective to timing and meeting deadlines
good,"Certainly not the worst place to work."
good,"If your not a people person, this is not the job for you. Pay is good for retail, but they are lowering their pay. I moved out of state and took a while to get into a lowes there, then when i moved back the lowes I worked at for 8 years would not take me back. They are hiring new people at lower pay rate. Hiring more part timers so they save money on health insurance. I will shop at home depot from now on."
good,Opening the store and greeting all the morning employees making sure that all the cashiers had there drawers ready at there registers made sure the schedule was covered for that day. Management was will to step in and help when needed. All the employees were will and able to help as well. I like seeing the customers faces when the see what they have been looking for.
good,If you like a job with set hours and if day shift you get 3 day weekends. Only about 2-3 months out of the year there is overtime and it can be mandatory. Depending on which department you end up in really depends on how physical your job will be. If you don't mind hard work the shipping and receiving departments will be fine for you though it gets really hot in the summers in these departments. Overall was a decent place to work though if you don't make your percentages on performance they will target you and give you a hard time until you straighten up and fly right. Turnover is very very high here but if you just do your job and don't cause drama you will have no problems.
good,Lowes does not look out for part timers who have families. Those are the first to get hours cut when sales arent up to par. Those people are the back bone of the company.
good,"Only worked there a short time. They are looking for mostly part time 25 hours per week expect to work every weekend. People friendly, HR manager not so much. Full time people work crazy hours, close store which means there until 11 pm and open store next morning starting time 5 am but will only end up with 39 hours per week."
good,My position with the company requires very demanding physical work. I do not mind physically demanding work. My coworkers do not share my work ethic and determination. The result is that I must always work harder.
good,I made sure that the plants were nourished. This job was seasonal. The best part of my job was working with the public. I enjoy helping others.
good,"I work with commercial customers to maintain sales growth, and ensure my customers are satisfied with Lowe's service.  With maintaining sales growth I also work to acquire new customer accounts."
good,"Scheduling is done by assistant store managers, rather than department managers.  Department Managers know best what their personnel requirements are."
good,It was a good job to have. A great group of people to work with. I would reccomend Lowe's to anybody; who was looking for a job.
good,I delivered construction supplies and appliances. Management support was not provided due to lack of training in my opinion.
good,working with this company can be tough sometimes because it is retail and its all about numbers to upper management - other than that the people there closer to your job role treat you like family and you become to form into a unit to try to meet goals. Also pays decent wages for younger people in school / right out of school
good,I worked seasonal in lawn and garden and I enjoyed it. Co-workers were friendly and we got along. There was no air conditioner outside in the summer months so that was a little bit annoying but tolerable. Would work there again.
good,"All about the numbers there, however I did learn a lot and inherited some skills there that will definitely help me in my future. Is a very fast paced environment to work in, but enjoyable. The pay rate is very good as well."
good,I would go up to my supervisors and ask them what needs to be done. I would be put on self checkout or at a regular register. They are flexible with you.
good,Lowes has grown into a large retail company and does provide a clean and safe work environment and do provide opportunity for people who are looking to make a career in retail.
good,"Management and HR Manager are terribly in Mocksville. They make the employees feel uncomfortable and are always looking for ways to fire someone. Especially if you have any years in. "
good,"My typical day is coming in and doing paper work with the stock of the shelves, i also help customers. Mp tasks are stocking and fulling the shelves and zoning up the product."
good,the most enjoyable part of my job at lowes was making sure the customers was happy. the most rewarding part of the job was not having to work in the store .
good,Lowe's is a great place to work if you're patient and willing to wait for the right opportunities to open up. They try their best to incentivize their sales team.
good,"good place to work good employees, management was well ran. treated customers correctly and employees were treated fairly."
good,"Some positions in this company will consume your life. The pay is decent and many people have been with the company quite a long time.  Otherwise, it's a revolving door."
good,"While the co-workers are cool and responsible, the new Store Manager and current HR are by the book and cause conflicts with life that is not by the book. Little to zero compromises and feel like they are disconnected with understanding their employees."
good,That's where I really learned about being a manager. You have to deal with so many different people on a daily bases. You have to have the ability to talk to the people that come into the store. Since most of them are part of the neighborhood that the store is in even thou you may not live there you become part of the community.
good,"Everyday I learned something new. When you work for Lowe's, you are entering into a mathematical, educational, and energetic environment. I worked in hardware and lumber where math is used constantly and there's always something new. My job was hard at first, at the point when I had to learn every item. The best part of my job was being able to provide excellent customer service."
good,the company is a good company with good benefits it was a nice place to work i didnt like that sort of retail they are very honest with the customers
good,"Great job, learned a lot about keeping up my new home. "
good,"A typical day consists of dealing with customer issues, merchandise placement and mentoring and dealing with employees.  Never boring, lots of challenges."
good,Lowe's enable employees to pick up new skills by method of cross training and inter-departmental rotation. While working at Lowe's I learnt to operate fork lift and various other equipment need to perform my job.
good,"did cash register, cash handling, bagging grocery, counting out of register at the end of the shift.  Customer service and meeting new people was challenge."
good,"Great place to work, co-workers here are all about there customers."
good,i really enjoyed working at lowes. You got to meet different people daily. Helping them with there daily project. Sparking conversation and gaining experience.
good,"Been working since 2008. Worked like a family in the company. Everyone works as a team. If you get managers that support you than you will do great in your position, if you are are having problems with managers supporting you than you will experience some stress and this depends on what department you work in."
good,"A typical day working at Lowe's is fast pace , multitasking roller coaster ride. I have learned to deal with different personalities/ customer's simultaneously.Management is easy going. Co-workers are pleasant easy to get along with. The heavy lifting that you are required to do from time to time. Helping the customer's"
good,"can be very stressful and overwhelming at times in delivery department. Thankfully I have a great, funny work associates who are fun to be around."
good,The store I was located at did not have a good management staff and they really didn't care about it's employees. The overall benefits for the company were nice though.
good,Experienced delivering to great customers. I learned roatating the back of the truck and unloading and loading the truck. Learned teamwork between me and the driver.
good,typical day consist of stocking items on shelves helping with customers and being the best at my position doing my job in a timely matter
good,I arrive at 5 am and scan all empty shelf space to missing merchandise. I help out in other departments. I run a register. Help customers when needed.
good,"When I first started there, I LOVED it. So much fun learning about all the different aspects of the paint department as well as home. I was PT, the pay was AMAZING, the people I worked with were AMAZING.. But the hr and management were terrible at communication and were not understanding of certain situations. Also, terrible hours! Was told 25ish, once got about 10/wk... NOT cool."
good,"A typical day at Lowes, I deal with a lot of customers on a daily basis, I sale a lot of appliances, I do all of the inventory, make work lists for employees to follow, and schedule employees times."
good,"great place to work for great benefits. I learned a lot about household appliances, the hardest part about the job was locating homes in the country at night."
good,"fast paced retail. stock shelves daily, answer numerous phone calls a day, price, clean merchandise, resolve customer complaints"
good,"Decent place to work with tons of job opportunities. If you're okay with managers skipping over you for job advancements because they'd rather hire family and friends over you, then you should be okay."
good,"Watering plants"
good,"After walking the areas of responsibility, I would write work list for those under me. I learned how to mentor and show respect. Working as a team is always best. Some of the best co-workers you will ever find.The most difficult part of the job was not being able to correct problems through employees who didn't want to work. The most enjoyable part was company party's."
good,"the environment t lowes is okay. its just hard being tied to a desk all day by a headset, staring at a computer screen. But the ovderall experience there is not bad. you can definitely make a career."
good,Loading trucks was a physical job. It kept me in shape. Operating the forklifts and walkie riders was fun. I enjoyed working with my co workers and having every weekend off.
good,I spent most time unloading the truck at night with items and placing them on the appropriate pallets.    Then I would take them to the appropriate floors.   Occasionally I would collect carts out in the front of the store or work in the lumber area.
good,A typical day consists of clocking in and completing a list of task along with providing outstanding customer service. Also managing the employees around you.
good,"The day always started out with freight, lead into daily sales reports. Set expectations for the 4 employees on there job requirements or tasks for the day and week ahead.there was not any difficulties for me in the electrical department because of being an electrician for nearly 40 years.Always enjoyed helping customers with any project they had at home."
good,"Environment can be fun at times, but my job can be very physically demanding. The wages here are decent. I have met amazing people here, and have learned very valuable things from them. I do not like the schedule that working in retail requires."
good,"customer service is a job I enjoyed. I am a people person and a pretty good salesman also. assisting people, and making sure they got what they need. Having returned customers come back requesting me by name, further let me know they were satisfied with my service."
good,"lowes es una empresa que se rige bajo 6 valores, los cuales estan inclinados al bienestar de los empleados y clientes"
good,"not the career I was looking for. Fun job in Downingtown, PA.  Worked cash register, dealt with customers in a positive way"
good,"The hours were rough and the work itself could be rough. Walking on concrete for eight hours a day is demanding on your body and the pay is far from stellar, but you could have some fun at work with co workers and customers. Management is very out of touch though"
good,"It's cool and  ok to work.It's similar as any other company."
good,while working with lowes at first the fob was really good and amazing but after awhile there were many managers who whould come to the back and complain that we were working to slow when they ethere only had 1-3 people unloading the truck and there was one manager who didn't care about the unloaders for example there was one employee that nearly hit another and whin he told the anager he basically said tough luck live with it; but there were only one really cool manager that would help us unload the truck when we were understaffed (which was almost always) and was I would say the best manager out of the whole store.
good,"I worked hard at lowes, but had some great associates to work with. We stayed very busy with customers or bringing in freight to stock the shelves that were low on freight."
good,I was a customer service associate and would create orders that would go out for delivery. As well as using heavy machines
good,Good friendly people and entertaining customers good training and community involvement good paced work always something to do.
good,The delivery team are hard working guys for the most part management never seems to know what's going on until the last minute little to any organization there's alot of playing the blame game amongst management when it comes to customers orders being messed up if you have a cdl don't waste your time the pay is worth it if you are trying to make money they will work with you and your schedule last minute deliveries are pushed on you to please customers they don't care how tired you are or if you just did 15 deliveries  in 8 hours
good,"a typical day at lowes is fun and interesting. the interesting part of it is the different people i meet. people as in customers who i have help with their merchandise and also the questions they ask me. the fun part of my job at lowe's is the contractors i meet. because some time they are very helpful. another fun part of my is i get to operate two forklift. i work in the building material/lumber department. so i get operate the forklifts. especially when i get to off load the material we receive off the trailer trucks we get through the lumber receiving area. and i also load up our lowe's truck when we're sending out "
good,Co-workers are great to work with.  Never mind working and helping customers when they were looking for items.  Tried to always make the customer happy.
good,"My typical day at work goes from filing paper work, to getting multiple calls in front of a customer and having an installer waiting for you all at the same time. I love being an install sales coordinator. It has it's high and low points about it. My department manager is an amazing manager to work with. I've learned how to coordinate installs and no one can stop learning from customer service. Their is always something new to learn from that. The hardest part of that job, I can say is actually finding a stopping point at the end of the day. The thing with install sales is that, there is always something coming up, which is always good. That's how you take care of the customer at the end of the day. Going above and beyond is all about customer service."
good,the lowes team was a good one until someone called out or just didn't show for work they never knew how to work under pressure but the customers never seen them sweat
good,Load up the delivery truck and take out delivery's to customers. Management was decent and co-workers where okay to get along with. hardest part of the job was to make sure you didn't damage any product.
good,"Lowe's has a great working culture and great co-workers. Lumber/building materials is extremely (!) physical and you must be able to sling 80 pound quikcrete bags without help. Weekday customers are mostly contractors who don't need much help, but the DIY people will really test your knowledge over the weekends. Lowe's is good about giving you plenty of breaks and letting you set your pace, as well as decent employee empowerment."
good,"Clock in. Proceed to the back of the store and begin unloading cargo off of shipping truck. Separated cargo into organized groups based on package labeling. "
good,I did enjoy working around people and dealing with customers on a day to day basis. I was disappointed to be let go so suddenly and without warning.
good,This is a big box retail position. Support of the staff is vital to success in this position. It is all about sales numbers and behavior. Make the sales numbers and behave and this is a place to work for.
good,I worked in the Marquette branch of Lowes. Business here is not as busy as the stores downstate so free time was plentiful. When customers were in the store I would assist them finding what they needed and explained to them how the electrical products worked. The best part of the job was learning how the products worked and then explaining it to the customers. Also problem solving by listening to people's electrical problems within their house was fun. My co-workers were always fun to work with and knowledgeable about other products that I didn't know about within the store. The most difficult part of the job was walking around for hours with no customers in the store. With no customers in the store we resorted to cleaning the store and organizing our department. Overall it was a good college job that required me to use my brain to figure out customer's electrical problems and their product needs.
good,"worked there for 10 years, it was an ok place to work, if you weren't a Monday to Friday employee, you were guaranteed two Sundays of a month and one Saturday. good pay for retail. and most managers remembered we're all human"
good,Lowes is a great company to work for. You never have a set schedule..so its hard to have a personal life working for Lowes full time. If you are a peoples persons Lowes is a good job for you.
good,A typical day at work consisted of bringing in carts from the parking lot and helping customers load up their merchandise.
good,"on the register customer service learned different programs train new people if they need help internet orders "
good,"I worked this job when I was younger, no children at the time."
good,"I learned customer service skills."
good,"Coordinate with my coworkers the product resets for the store. My position is a ""Product Service Associate."""
good,"A typical day at work is a long hard day at work you have some good days and some bad days, the hardest part of the job is working hard long hours consistently and the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know new people ."
good,"Good management, Good co-workers. Terrible pay. Learned how to handle customer complaints on a face to face basis and answer a multi line phone system"
good,This job gave me experience in customer service. I had amazing co-workers and it wasn't a tense environment. Overall it was a good entry-level job.
good,"A typical day at work is going to the sales floor and check that the merchandise is ready for sale. I learned different lawn, garden equipment and merchandise. Management is willing to teach you how to go up in management. Co-workers are willing to teach you and help you become more productive. The hardest part of the job is working different shifts and long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is to learn how to use lawn and garden equipment."
good,"Working at Lowe's is no different from from working at a large corporation like Wal-Mart, Target or Home Depot. Policies would be made that odiously would not work  and only make it harder for employes to do there jobs. Some times the policies would be changed back."
good,The hardest part of the job is truly finding a place within this organization.  There are many people refusing to change and you need to be willing to adapt to succeed.
good,"Overall I loved working for Lowes, West End. Store manager is great. Staff were also great to work with. However, the ASM's, for the most part have minimal people and leadership skills. In particular would be the loss prevention/safety manager. This individual consistently harasses and intimidates the female staff and members of the staff whose only income is Lowes. He has gone so far as to send a female employee up a ladder to clean fixtures while she was in a leg cast. He has a hate on for the military and has said, in front of anyone willing to listen, that he will get this person or that person. He has made one young lady cry and quit her job. These things are known by management but nothing is ever done to him. Since he has come to the west end location(from the south store) Lowes has lost some very good staff and the morale, that was once very high, is now gone.  Lowes, at least in the West end, does not seem to care about their staff enough to fix the problems and would rather continually hire and retrain staff. Frustrating for those of us that care about Lowes and our jobs"
good,This company has competitive benefits also many stock opportunities. As a sales specialist I enjoy getting to build relationships with my repeat customers.
good,Good place to work. I enjoy the family envoroment. I typically work as a team and support all employees. I learned daily and perform work functions with the best of my abilities.
good,"Good place to work if you need to make ends meet for you financial situations. They pay good and give you a chance to learn what you need to know, but they do not believe in working around other schedules."
good,"Not impressed with the way that employees are abused. Management does NOT value the workers, all they care about is making their quota and bonuses."
good,"A normal day at work starts by first removing concrete pallets (used to eliminate theft) off of the lumber and sheet rock outside and under the lumber canopy. Next we complete the DSHR (Daily Safety and Hazmat Review) and down-stock any IRPs while, of course, assisting the needs of customers. The day has several busy waves of contractors and customers for whom we pull orders."
good,"If you can endure the long-term beating that the concrete floor do to your feet, knees and hips, Lowe's provides a good career option. Job security is great and pay is above average. If you are looking for full-time work, you must be wiling to work any day."
good,Overall Lowe's is a good company to work for. Standard 9 hour shifts with 1 hour unpaid lunch. Management styles vary per store. Some positions require a vast amount of physical labor with little regard for employee safety.
good,"Disfruto de un gran ambiente laboral y convivo con un equipo de trabajo muy capaz y agradable, somos al rededor de 10 persoans, Con ellos llevo un gran relación empleado compañero, desarrollamos las diferentes tareas que se nos son asignadas dependiendo de para que departamento sea, estoy dentro del departamento  de medios digitales."
good,the most enjoying time i have at lowe's is working with my co working being able to do stuff that i love which is customer service. I've learned so much at this job being a cashier. just being able to enjoy with you love to do is great.
good,"Typical work day, are task delegated by the Department manager, review planograms and build resets according to those planograms."
good,"Typical hourly, shift-work job. High employee turnover, opportunities for advancement and inter-company transfer. Employee stock options and other decent benefits."
good,great place fun place to work friendly co workers its just a laid back place no drama everyday is a great day the pay is pretty good benefits are great
good,"Lowe's has produced strong results over the past 60 years.  It's a fortune 50 company, started in Wilkesboro, NC.  It continues to expand in the US and Internationally."
good,a day in the rent to own business consists of opening store getting store ready for customers and sales and collection of money
good,unload trailers and divided all the freight by department on plastic pallets and take them out to there department and stock freight that's running low on supplies and also fix and make it look suitable for customers to access what they need.
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for. The full time benefits are good. Good opportunities to move up in managerial positions
good,the job was busy and keeps you motivated. friendly work environment and lots to learn from upper management. The co-workers are friendly and open minded.
good,"Good benefits and clean, pleasant work environment. The work in installed sales was just not fast paced enough for me. Pay was decent."
good,I'm a day shift team member and I work from 6:00am to 4:30pm. I work Monday through Thursday and have Friday-Sunday off. 10 hours of moving boxes can be hard work but if you are willing to work hard this is not a bad job. They have great benefits and they acknowledge achievements regularly with catered meals.
good,I worked with some very interesting people. I had fun meeting and talking to new customers. I felt very underpaid for how much work I put in with this company.
good,"worked hard throughout the night to stock store.  Needed more personnel for the job. Workload was too much some nights.  Overall, good job for younger people in need for a job."
good,I had to work outside when i worked there and that kind of sucked but the benefits were good. i didnt get paid enough for working there and doing what i was doing was bad.
good,"Overall a great place to work, The benifits are great, the co-workers are awesome, The managment will work with your school schedule. Even if you prefer to shop at the ""orange"" store Lowe's takes way better care of there employees."
good,"Dealing with customers keeps the job interesting. They always have questions about different things . The management can be hot or miss most days. They are not the best at helping you when you have questions, they tell you to figure it out yourself most of the time."
good,"-busy work day"
good,"I was in charge of cleaning restrooms and offices, as well as the store floor. I was also making sure that every piece of equipment was in proper working order. When needed, I assisted in other departments outside of my working hours."
good,"An overall day working at Lowe's is okay. The one thing I do like about my job currently is the hours that I have. Other than that, it's hard to get the managers to try and work around your outside of work schedule."
good,"Worked there a few months as a cashier. Made the new people work multiple areas while the older employees stayed at one spot and did not do much. At one point I was doing cashier, carts, garden and delivery in one day. One day it rained all day and I was coming in the afternoon shift. They waited for me to come in so I could get the carts because nobody else wanted."
good,Great atmosphere to meet and instruct on Diy jobs for each customer. Fun and new assignments daily that require detailed knowledge of tools.
good,Lowe's is a very fast paced challenging retail environment. If you are willing to put in the time the rewards are there for you.
good,"Fast paced work, but the fact that we always work as a team and have great managers makes the day go by fast and easy. The hardest part of the job is loading 4o, 60 and even 90 80 lbs. and 90 lbs. bags for a single customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with customers and building a relationship with them. Not only being able to help with their needs, but also build a relationship and have them give such great compliments about you. It just feels great to know you're making a difference."
good,Working at Lowe's was a great opportunity for me. The management team provided support to their staff and each day brought a new experience working with the public.
good,Great workplace with nice management. The management was very understanding with my work school schedule. Trained me very well and provided me with skills needed for advancement with the company.
good,"I loved my Co-Workers. Some of the management I did not like. I Learned how to handle transactions, and cash count. The hardest part of my job was when customers would get mad at me. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers when they weren't mad about a price or a product we no longer carried."
good,"Potential for advancement, working hours will vary, open on holidays with the exception of Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years."
good,didn't work their for too long but the atmosphere was fun they are strict when it comes to eating the snacks etc but overall fun
good,"I worked on a daily bases that handled calls coming from a wide array of backgrounds and ethnicities, and religious beliefs"
good,I loaded and unloaded customers vehicles. management was new and un-proven but over time excelled. whole job was fun anf a great experience
good,Ok place to work.  The company needs to let the stores have more say so.  Great to work with people and learning different trades.
good,"Working at Lowe's is time-consuming and not very flexible. Shifts are sporadic, varying from opening at 7 a.m. to closing at 11 p.m. The management team seems more of a club rather than fellow coworkers. The hardest part of the job was during holiday seasons but the most enjoyable part is when you find the exact item for a customer."
good,Fun place to work. Enjoyed the people and environment. Would work there again. Management has good leadership and they are very understanding.
good,very nice place to work co-workers and customers are nice to work with and advancement is possible in the long run with hard work

good,"revisar la bitácora de citas, correo de proveedores, empezar revisando las descargas y cargas de las cajas de trailer."
good,"The team atmosphere was good, great people, the benefits are great. lots of work to do. management is good, the schedule is hard to deal with and the expectations of customers can be outlandish if you don't have a product in stock. vendors can be difficult to work with"
good,"My day consist of answering customer's concerns, and to make sure the customer always leave feeling satisfied. I assist with customer's returns/refunds, and internet orders."
good,Pay is very good for retail and job duties are fair but management is very poor. Can not seem to keep to corporate schedule. Always something to do which is good. company software is terrible.
good,Good environment to learn products and customer service.  Meet and greet customers and help them find the materials they are looking for.
good,"Meet and greet customers, good way to learn about the products that is being sold.  Friendly and helpful staff willing to help."
good,"Help customers, stock shelves, push carts, use power equipment. Co-workers are great but management could use some help"
good,"From the beginning management and staff were incredibly friendly and hands on with their training, they made sure you understood what your position entitled."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the benefits. I only worked there for 3 months and left to take a job on first shift. The management was great to work for.
good,Typical day 9 hour shifts. working weekends you get every other weekend off co workers are great fun just the over nights arent fun but the morning meetings a great
good,"This was a very overly laid back work environment. Almost too laid back to the point where I looked like I was trying to out work everyone just by working the way I normally would. Working in the south and moving from Philadelphia didn't get me many friends, but the ones that I did make I'm still friends with to this day."
good,"- A typical day at work was unpredictable, never knowing what could be in store for the day."
good,While working at Lowe's I have experience and met a lot of wonderful people there. I had a wonderful experience and learn new skills as well.
good,"i forgot the temp company but they were very favorable to the ones who were of a latino persuasion, obviously giving them more breaks and less work, unfair to everyone else, lowes was not to blame just the temp company"
good,very family oriented management showed passion not only for his work but for his workers everybody got along and worked very well together
good,It was actually a great environment much different from were im originally from  which is North Carolina. the co-works were fun but ready to work at the same time !
good,I guess the title says it all. It's great for people who need part time work and a somewhat flexible schedule.  Some stores can be very clique-y.
good,"Most days I would be outside pulling carts and helping customers with their purchases. I learned that customers were not always top priority as they claimed they were. Managers were rather rough around the edges. Some co workers were very friendly, while others were not. Hardest part was when I was helping a customer, I get pulled away from them to do 5 other jobs at once. Most enjoyable part was being able to be outside all day usually in nice weather."
good,"I enjoyed answering customers questions and concerns"
good,"A typical day would include stocking shelves, cutting wire, finding items for customers. "
good,unload a night truck using power equipment and hands then bring fright to the floor for stpocking using hand and power equipment puting fright on shelves in stock or up top in top stock
good,"The store had it's slow days and busy days depending on the season. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. They all kept a smile on my face and with laughter. I learned a few things in each department. For example: how to mix paint. Knowing the difference of pipes and what their used for in Plumbing. How to cut blinds. What type of grout to use for flooring projects. The hardest part of my job was directing the customer's to the right area of what there looking for. Because the store is huge it's kind of hard to remember everything. It is a Home Improvement store. The most enjoyable moments is helping customer's, being able to talk with friends, enjoy what you do and having a set schedule."
good,"Working in a store that is full of different things, you get to learn a lot.  I learned about wood, tools and flowers.  The hardest part was the customers coming in the store being rude, but I did everything in my power to help them."
good,"-great place to work with lots of friendly and helpful staff"
good,Lowes was a very nice place to work all of the cashiers where very nice and the management was also very helpful and was always there to help you when you needed them
good,Lowe's was a very active environment on a daily basis. The people were very friendly and expected and provoke the best performance from all of their employees
good,from the time you clock on till you clock off is non stop work which is good never a dead moment but working short handed is an killer not recognize by management unless your getting wrote up but maybe all stores are different maybe
good,Lowe's is a great place to work but this is not my stopping point. I want more out of life. I want a career I love not just like.
good,Unloading and receiving the trucks shipments for Lowe's was my main duty for the day.  It was a physical job that I did like but I relocated about two hours away.  I was glad to learn new skills that I can utlilize at a new job.
good,Lowe's is a good company. I have learned a lot about how the retail business works. Lowe's is company that really cares about the community and people as a whole.
good,"A typical day as a head cashier was getting to work a half n hour early if you open or staying at least an hour after closing to take care of all the registers. Throughout the day you do the break and lunch schedules watch over all departments lawn and garden, returns, customer service, lumber and the regular checkouts. The co-workers aren't the nicest to the new people especially since the majority of them are usually older and set in their ways. I did enjoy the majority of the customers that came into the store."
good,Help customers get the right product to fix their needs. It was also very important to know every product in other departments in order to ensure the customer's needs are met.
good,Factory work same work daily.  Not a bad overall place tom work.  Shift vary and work can vary.  I would recommend if you are looking for some type of factory work.
good,"lowes is ok place to work for but management train you to move up. hour are good, pay depends on what management gives you and theirs negotiations at all"
good,"It's retail. You get yelled at and verbally abused by half the people you come across. Company pays fairly well and treats their employees fairly well. It's frustrating to have a return policy that isn't enforced and people can steal in front of your face, but you can't do anything but smile and watch them walk out the door."
good,Management needs more training when working with employees. Something else that needs to be worked on is the diversification of the management. Too many of the management staff are white men.
good,Lowes provides a relaxing environment where employees are more than willing to provide assistance to customers. A typical work day would include assisting customers in purchasing major appliances.
good,I have been at lowes for years trying to move up in the company and get told some story. Would like to advance in company but unable to. Some of the employee's that they hire do not have the experience.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's for the most part. Lessons to learn with management.Nothing else to say, somethings are better left unsaid. I have nothing to add to this at this time."
good,I like most the people that work there some cared not all of them it was nice u learn new things and meet new people all the time.
good,"you only get one weekend off a month. Co-workers keep you coming back.  For a job well done, the most comments and for being at the company for five years they thank you with another tape measure to put in your tool box along with the other 3."
good,Nice company though its new to this place and one of the leading company in retail domain especially in home improvement area
good,"At Lowes I work with Commercial sales and pro services. I help to load customers as well as help where help is needed."
good,We didn't work enough hours. About an hour after you got there they would make you go ahead and take your break and that made the day or night extra long. When we closed at night we had to stay and clean the store.
good,Experiences very from store to store. Find a store with a good store manager and youll have a great time. Different types of work availabe including sales floor and clerical. Most holidays and weekends worked and varying hours.
good,I learned how do customer service in retail. My co-workders was ok to work with. The harest part of the job was the difficult comstomer form time to time.
good,Shift started at 0400 and ended at 1300-1400. This job was perfect because it was pretty much what I was doing in the Air Force. Worked seven days in a row one week and only three days a week the next. I was responsible for making sure that delivery orders were pulled and staged for deliver. These delivers included items from all over the store but were mainly appliances and lumber.
good,A good job to keep you in shape and get paid at the same time. This job can help you train your salesman techniques. A physically demanding job that is different every day.
good,I worked in customer service in the hardware and tools department.  I enjoyed helping the customers with their questions and needs.  I made some great friends while I was there.
good,"Overall fun environment, and I loved getting to know the regular customers. People that work there truly care for customers."
good,"Productive, Hiring process is flawed in that the point system doesn't always yield the most qualified candidate."
good,"Typical work day will either involve being on register or up at the customer service desk. As a cashier, I will ring up customers, sign people up for our Lowe's membership, sell EPP's (extended protection plans) and explain to them all our other benefits with Lowe's credit card and other business accounts. I am currently the 3rd best seller of EPP's in my department. As customer service associate, I have all the same responsibilities as cashier, but also handle deliveries, receive internet orders, answer phones, transfer calls and communicate with the entire store, I am also able to sign customers up for Lowe's credit cards. Both as cashier and CSA I am also part of the loss prevention system, applying different techniques during sales in order to deter theft and have recovery without detention."
good,I only worked nights. Some nights were really busy and long and others were slow. I enjoyed working there. As my first job in retail it taught me a lot about customer service. Be patient with people ven when they are rude to you.
good,For 5 yrs. it was great then they changed management. they seemed to get rid of the people who were making the most money and had been there longer.
good,"It was somewhat mundane work, of which, during the orientation, I was warned about. I was far more advanced with my experience than others. I wished there was more to do, or at the very least, some drawing and design work. I had no problems with my Supervisor, he was very informative and relaxed; and got along with everyone I worked with."
good,"Employees there help any and every customer the best way possible."
good,"a typical day at Lowe's for me was sometime fast pace, then later it would slow down, lots of conversations with costumers about life and sports and etc."
good,"Not place to work for a person with a family, rotating shifts does't leave much time for a family life.  Coworkers are usually great we usually ended up more like family.  We always seemed to work as a team."
good,"most enjoyable for the first 5 yrs. of my 6 yr.employment, but with changes in management come many changes across the whole store and not always necessarily for the better.  Store morale is very low and I feel it is time for me to go. I love working with the public and strive to be the best customer service associate possible, and have received 2 certificates of recognition for outstanding customer service from the President of Lowe's Canada."
good,"Most of your time is spent making sure the department is looking neat and clean. The rest of the time is spent trying to help customers and meet monthly sales targets. Not a bad place to work if you can handle the retail hours, and the issues that can come with customer service."
good,"worked for this company for 11 years "
good,everyone was nice but the pay was very low. I just hated working outside when it was to hot.
good,Great room for advancement for internal associates. Worked for the company for ten years.
good,Overall Lowe's is good place to learn and develop. It has great benefits for full time employees. Employees are able to get extra money on their check each quarter. And employee moral is important to Lowe's.
good,"It is a great company but, it is a difficult working. The size of the trucks make a difference on the amount of product available to sell. The store is expanding from just hardware to other things to meet the demands of the ever demanding market and consumer."
good,"Typical day would be answering questions, selling power equipment, stocking shelves and printing price tags. I learned a lot about rf guns and how to drive a fork lift. The hardest part of the job was when I was new and unfamiliar with the product and asked all about them. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers. Everyone wanted to see the other person succeed. Not dog eat dog."
good,"It is long days, with much expected. Pay is not reasonable for the work expected"
good,"Stocked and handled product, loaded boxes in trucks to be shipped to stores."
good,"I enjoy enacting with customers,meeting new people,working as a team.I also enjoyed working in other areas like outside lawn and garden,lumber,customer service desk."
good,"My typical day at work revolves around every customer I encounter. My primary mission at Lowes is to make sure that each customer has a question answered, more product knowledge of an item and when certain in-stock items will be available to them. "
good,A typical day at work you may start out in one department but end up in another department. You learn as you go this job can be a challenge at times but you must stay focus and be able to listen to your customer needs.
good,This job was an OK job. I went around from different departments helping customers. If other employees needed help I'd help them to. I help keep things clean. I helped with inventory and maintain locations as well.
good,"•	Maintained up-to-date knowledge of store policies regarding payments"
good,Working the with customers was very enjoyable. I liked the hard work. This was a great fill in until I could find clerical work
good,the people are great to work with but the management is very poor. They are not a good emplyoyer. at least not where I worked
good,Lowe's is a pleasant and friendly environment to work.  Managers and co-workers are respectful and helpful to not only customers but also to other co-workers I enjoyed learning new things such as the training for a fork lift license.
good,"Learned a lot about home products, interaction with customers was very good.  Overall, a great place to work if you are looking for part time work or for something to do in retirement.  Very hard to get the hours you would need to make a decent living on though if this is your only source of income."
good,"Typical job for younger people. Stocking shelves, answering questions, helping people find items, and pulling orders was the normal day. The area manager was great and easy to work with, my coworkers were friendly and were fun to be around. The hardest part of the day was sweeping the concrete aisle. The zone manager was sometimes hard to deal with but overall it was not a bad place to work."
good,"Working with customer service, busy solving people problem, everyone is friendly, management have a lot of patience,"
good,"Not the best, but not the worst.  Not something you want to be at forever.  Go to school and get a good paying job.  Management was pretty cool, but co workers can be really lazy and offload everything on you.     aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
good,"If you keep to yourself, the company is good. There are a lot of cliques, sort of like high school. I enjoyed doing my job when it was not a power struggle between managers."
good,a different place to work..keeps you on your toes always have to find solutions to the problem
good,"I felt that I wasn't given the right tools to do my job at this company. I love my job here but there were to many playing favorites. I learned that its not what you know its who you know! My co workers were very clicky and not very professional. I would say that my managers should spend more time making sure that there is consistent communication with there new employees. The hardest part of my job was trying to get the training I needed to do my job. It took 8 months to get and by then it was to late. I feel the management should show more respect to there employees and make them feel valuable and appreciated.  The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with the receiving area,I enjoyed making a team out of my employees and giving them some consistantsy."
good,Its an easy job and the employers are down to earth and willing to work with your schedule. This is a job that's hard to get fired from because they don't expect a lot from you and what they do expect isnt extremely difficult.
good,you have great retain rate will work with hours lowes you also get to learn a lot of things
good,"Manager of a team of merchandising experts who remodeled and re-graphed Lowe's interiors.

good,It had great people and the employees were wonderful to work with.  The pay and benefits were really good for retail and management was good.
good,Very high pace environment with the ability to help the consumer to better their life at home. As  well as helping the development of managers and co-workers to advance their careers to a higher level.
good,"A typical day involved assisting customers with products in the Electrical department, downstocking shelves, and interacting with coworkers.  Management was a mix of ""hands off"" approach, letting the workers call for help when needed and micromanagement.  Management did care for their employees, providing free food and drink on holidays."
good,"Fast paced, meet new people on a dail basis, coworkers are friendly"
good,No comments on this employer at this time. Really good place to work as a company. This location has a turnover of good qualified people due to the store manager
good,The thing I enjoyed most was my co-workers and salary. the hardest part of the job unloading the trucks with a short staffed team.
good,My co-workers overall where great always willing to help and learn it was a good company to work for overall I just think the managers running the store should have more training on ways to interact with the people working for them
good,"I answered multiple phone lines, directed calls to appropriate departments, answered questions, ran interference between managers and customers."
good,"This is an ok place to work for. Busy seasonal job, but they will cut hours tremendously when they get slow."
good,A nice place to work - all new equipment and beautiful building - Coaches seemed to be in strong competition and passed their feelings on to the team
good,Management not as good. Can get alot of hours. Make alot of money. Peers are great and picky about who can advances
good,"Assisted customers"
good,"This is a fun place to work but it can get kind of annoying at the same time, reason being because there is a lot of young people working here and it's like high school all over again. But other than that, if your going to school and need a part time job to get money for books and/or courses. I'd recommend working here"
good,"okay good job, can be stressful at times. If you do your job and work hard you will be okay"
good,"Check for safety issue, downstock and fill products assist customers with product needs and information. Put away freight clean all areas of departments . Assist other departments. Do reports"
good,"My daily job duties included the typical Aisle Maintenance, following up and closing estimates from previous customers. I feel this position is a self starting position with little guidance needed. If you can not perform this job with out the help of management you need not be in the position, and I also feel certain members of management felt the need to inquire, and correct when nothing was needed. They felt as if they needed to be involved for the department to run smoothly which definately was not the case."
good,Get the another great opportunity to increase the experience level of face to face customer service and admin office.
good,"Fun people to work with, great company, just terrible management due to the gap of Management and o hands employees."
good,ok place to work pays well hard to stay employed very safety orientated any little mistake will get you fired
good,I have learned different venues of making high dollars purchases
good,"Learn different trades, learn about new products to make work and life at home easier."
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers they were lively and helpful, the working environment was great, offering versatility. I was able to learn skills and product knowledge across all departments."
good,I came to work and punched the clock then went home after working my hardest.
good,"Loews was a nice place to work, work not challenging enough.  I did my daily requirements and there was not much overtime or additional responsibilities to be had.  I like a challenge and to change up sometime"
good,"The company is a very stable work environment with many people to work with, which would cause problems for certain people. It seemed to be over the top with micromanagement.  Aside from that, everyone did their parts to get jobs done in an orderly fashion.  With the large variety of employees it always made for exciting, enjoyable work days."
good,"keeping shelves organized and clean. Customer friendly. Management would help if you needed anything. Answering calls into customer services, ordering products on computer and updating customers when product would be in."
good,"Boring, monotonous job with little pay or benefits. No brain power required. Just scan. Lots of scanning."
good,I conduct inventory cycle counts each week.  I operate a forklift to down stock inventory and to load customer's purchases.  Assist customers in their purchases in the Garden Center.  Conduct safety walks daily.  Management is a good source of support when needed. I enjoy working with my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is the retail schedule and heavy lifting.  The most enjoyable part is being able to work in the Garden Center where I get to work with many different types of plants and various other garden related materials.
good,"Provided excellent customer service, processed transactions answered phones, stocked etc. I didn't really learn a whole lot working there. Management and employees for the most part were great to work with. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is the upset customers or not having an answer to a customers question although I would always get an answer. I loved the customer service part."
good,Poorly educated and trained management that blindly directs underlings without weighing consequences of their behavior.  There are few long term employees.  The attitude and tempo of each store varies greatly based on the store Manager.
good,Work was done in a neat and clean place.  Everyone worked together to offload merchandise and then bring to the appropriate department.  At the end of the night you would clean out the truck and the work place.  People were kind and courteous.
good,lowes sucks and the people are very rude but they do have good benefits
good,The employee's are a great group of people that pull together to get things done. We are also customer focused at all times.
good,I loved working at Lowe's I used to work at the customer service desk and dang was I busy all the time. Sadly everyone had to leave their job because the store was closed down.
good,"A family like environment among the employees, Management liked employees who showed that they could direct themselves in their jobs and keep busy, Though the customers were the hardest part of the job, I enjoyed working with them in outside garden."
good,"help customers, operate power equipment when needed, make sure its a clean work environment"
good,"The management only cares about meet certain statistics numbers and their bonuses. We're under staff, constantly, therefore everybody is overworked and can not provide top notch customer service at all times. It's kind of frustrating."
good,I didn't enjoy my experience there much. I learned how to handle several tasks at once and how to manage time.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with.I wish I had more training as an employee.
good,I really enjoyed the fast pace in which was required to work there and I was able to learn more about what it takes to manage other people efficiently.
good,"Lowe's keeps their employees busy with either customers or work lists. Both customers and the work lists are sometimes challenging, but at the end of the day you feel a sense of accomplishment. Lowe's taught me great customer service and how to work with a team. Other employees at Lowe's are willing to help other co-workers and customers. The hardest part is finding a balance between helping customers and completing your work list by the end of a shift, but is certainly doable. Personally, I love helping customers better their experience at Lowe's."
good,When you're a seasonal employee you have consistent hours but further employment is based on the stores success and unfortunately i was a victim of last hired first fired because the store wasn't doing well in sales.
good,"I deal a large amount of customers everyday not only from my department but from the whole store in general. I have learned a lot about the paint industry and how it operates. I manage 5 people in my department, I write their schedule, plan their lunches and write their reviews. There are times where people don't come to work and I have to work in other departments with no coverage and that can be difficult at times when you have a line of impatient customers. But I enjoy interacting with each and every customer providing excellent customers service and giving them exactly what they need to complete their project."
good,"Nice co-workers, very friendly and helpful."
good,Liked the job and the work environment but the pay was terrible. You aren't allowed to accrue any over time so the minimum 40 hours per week don't provide enough money for the job responsibilities.
good,"it was a very fun job. I enjoyed working with the customers and my team. everyone was able to stay busy and ask for help when needed. If I was wanting to go back I would and, I'm sure it would be great."
good,"A typical day at Lowe's involves tending to customers.  I would make transactions at the cast register, help customers load items into their vehicles, and assist in any other way I possibly could."
good,"Typical day at work, receiving inventory packets, worked well with management, was encouraged and rewarded when needed, coworkers easy to perform tasks with"
good,"I did learn a lot at Lowes, much more than just HR Manager, I moved around the store and learned all the functions in all the different departments. By the time I left I could mix paint, cut keys and carpet, order windows and flooring, work the registers and C/S desk. All in addition to the HR responsibilities of employee relations, coaching, staffing, scheduling, payroll, mgmt. training (soft skills) The hardest part of the job was getting out of the store at a decent hour, the most enjoyable were the people I worked with on a regular basis."
good,This job consisted of very hard work and undesirable hours. In the time that I was there I always had to work every weekend and was never given much of a chance to do anything different than what I did everyday.  It got to be very menial trying to work in the same old environment everyday with no encouragement to do better or receive a pay increase over a period of time.
good,"Lowes had a typical retail work environment, co-workers made the best of it and compensation was excellent compared to any other retail store iv worked."
good,"Lowes was, at that time, a good place to learn new things about all departments in the store.  Management encouraged all associates to learn the basics in all departments."
good,"While Lowe's was a good place to work the way they handle certain things weren't understandable. Medical leaves for surgeries should not be such a hassle for example. "
good,"interesting environment "
good,"The senior management is poor at best."
good,Need more training with in all departments.  Need training in install sales
good,"I clock in at work and i go back to receiving to find out what is going on for the day. If my delivery manager is at work, he will tell me what to do or tell me what is going on and what we have going out for the day. ill look in the system for delivery, and pull orders accordingly. I will take calls and answer questions for delivery. For going out on delivery i will load the truck according to the order of the stops we have then ill head out. The route is planned out for the day and we stick to the routing planned out. I punch in the phone when im traveling to the customers house, when im there, and when im finished. Then when we're all done we come back to lowes and clean the truck out and go home at the end of our shift. If we get back before the end of our shift we will do whatever our managers ask us to do. The enjoyable part of the job is to be able to be on the open road and not have to stay at one place for to long. I would say the hard part of the job is bringing in a huge fridge into a house, that is big and heavy with not many ways to pick it up."
good,"This was just a retail job. It wasn't really good or bad, at least for me. Most other employees weren't fond of it."
good,great job if full time with benifits. Alot of moving and very busy and always helping customers
good,"At one day the manager ask me to do extra work. first, I but a good plan to my work to make it so easy. the hardest part it was when my manager give my a time to do them. the good thing when I went back to my manager before his time. he was excited ."
good,place was good to work. but not much room to advance on up. managers are great and people there are sweet. great break room
good,Worked the Night Shift with good co workers. The hardest part of the job was working with rude co-workers and the most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck!
good,a place where it is hard to move up  they tell you one thing and do another
good,"fun place to work hard although receiving loading help when the outside en center became busy, getting backup for loading became a problem"
good,"I currently work in the back while unloading trucks each day, but I am such a people person that I would rather be on the floor helping customers with their projects."
good,"i go in assist customers, help my co-workers down stock/top stock products, mix paint, cut blinds. The hardest part of the job is that you have no set hours one week you can open and the next you close. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people, you meet all sorts of new interesting people. I have learned a lot about different types of paint/stains and the make-up of them."
good,"great people to work with, lots of product to learn about and where its stocked"
good,"Customer service representative,handle and count large amount of finances,process credit card applications an payments, also make copies, fax or email receipts, file and train new cashiers, input important data for the store manager to taking messages."
good,"Good Company to work for and has good benefits. Co workers"
good,i love helping customers with there problems an giving them solutions
good,"Worked here for nearly 6 years. Focused mostly on customer service, sales, merchandising, etc..."
good,"Good paying. It is what it is. I will blah blah blah."
good,Great place to work with many different cultures and possibility for advancement in position.
good,Lowes was okay. Too many policies and procedures. Basic customer service job. I did gain management knowledge though.
good,"Good company to wook for if they are in order."
good,"Lowe's isn't a bad place to work for. The worst part of the job is the wintertime, parttime hours are cut down to less than 15 hours per week."
good,"Lowes is a challenging place to work. I love what I do, being the support to make the sales floor successful is a success for me. I've learned that I am my best teacher. I am constantly using all the resources available to learn new aspects my job. I am proud of the fact that I find solutions to situations before I go to my supervisor."
good,Typical home improvement retailer. Ever changing benefits from year to year.
good,"Good environment,busy work day hardest part you are on your feet all day."
good,my overall view of the company is lack of training in many of the associates which caused many problem for customers. Many time customer would wait 15 minutes for a 2 minute issue cause proper resources were not available
good,A day to day routine is mainly taking care of each and every customer. Making sure that they are pleased with their overall experience. Maintaining a clean and safe workspace.
good,"Get paint machines ready for the day, cleaning, purging, and filling them.  Did not know anything about paint or window and walls, (the departments are combined) but after all the training I felt completely secure and confident with the advice and help I offered to our customers.  Great group of co-workers and relationships built.  The hardest part of the day would be trying to getting the customer to understand and follow the proper steps to fix a problem or achieve a specific outcome and the best part would be to see all the customers waiting and listening to the information given due to the training I received."
good,I worked seasonal there and it was good for me. Worked in lawn and garden
good,"Typical day is keeping department clean and helping customers.  Do not like the freight every morning, but really enjoyed most of the custoemers."
good,Great place to work and meet new people. There was never a dull moment.
good,Mostly MOD all day. I learned home improvement. Management were all promoted to open the Tucson store. Employees were good people. Had a lot of fires to put out every day. I enjoyed helping people with there home projects.
good,Overall employer was ok. I would be stuck outside all shift no matter how hot or how cold. When in the handbook it clearly stated the head cahiers were suppose to which outside cashiers every two hours in extreme hot or extreme cold. I'm southern so 13 degrees for 8 hours is pretty extreme to me.
good,Most all employees are very friendly and easy to get alone with.
good,"You have your in store management and then the area management staff then the regional management staff then the corporate offices nobody on the same page. As an in store manager you are instructed to run your business, then all the other managers get involved when they shouldn't and nobody is ever on the same page. It is ridiculous. I made a good wage and worked with a lot of great people, but the company as a whole is not employee friendly."
good,I learned how to deal with different co-workers and their personal issues while maintaining balance in my work conditions. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to schedule rotation. The most enjoyable part of the job was the meeting and interacting with new people everyday.
good,"A typical day was helping a customer find what they needed"
good,Not employee oriented as much as it once was. Changes over the past few years are not helping the company succeed.
good,depending on the store you work for it can be challenging to move up but it is a good company to work for
good,I worked at Lowes. Moved from cashier to paint in a relatively short period of time.
good,I handled the customer service desk and cashiering. I've learned about retail.
good,My job has excellent benefits.The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting different people. I've learned to have patience. The hardest part was being short handed and not having the support of the management staff.
good,"Open Shift 5:30 am putting products away from the truck till 10:00am then from 10:00-2:30 helping and assisting customers.  "
good,"A typical work day can be very busy. You are also do overridess for different Departments, gettig change for cashiers and assistingat the customer service desk."
good,I was in night stocking crew this is where i learned how to drive a forklift the staff was helpful training me
good,"During my tenure with Lowe's I learned time management as variables will always come up more often than not those variables being customers. "
good,i am a hardworker will to learn new things when given the chance
good,This company was good to worked for..nice team work....Managers they will help in all the can help you
good,Interested in joining the team once again.  Very productive company.
good,Checked out customers and answered phones. Busy and fast paced enviroment.
good,"Cashing customers, chatting with them and finding out what projected they are engaged in doing. To many managers, assistance managers, head cashiers and so on. I saw a big turn over while I was there, that is not saying much for the company. The hardest part was you always had to push things on customers, I personal did not like pushing things on customers, you asked once and if they say so be it. They want you to keep pushing it. The best part was interacting with all the customers, I have always enjoyed working with customers."
good,"Co-workers great to work with.  built customer relationships."
good,A typical day at lowes was 95% customer interaction and it was fast paced and enjoyalble
good,Working in the front end as a head cashier can be nerve wrecking at times because there is not enough help
good,havent been there long to say. cashier do returns answer phones
good,"I like working at my job. It seems we go through a lot of employees. I keep trying to advance there, but I don't interview well for management positions. They know how hard I work, but I guess that's not enough."
good,"Lumber and Building supply's department associate, i spent most days loading and unloading trailers with countless bags of concrete and carts of lumber, flat stocking the racks of lumber, helping customers estimate supply's cost for their projects they usually knew nothing about. Working in a home improvement store everyday allows  one too constantly see new tools and supply's that opened the mind too new ways of completing tasks and by talking too the contractors you can get a good idea about what kind of work go's into each job."
good,"A sales associate stocks shelves, maintains the sales floor, and assists store patrons with exceptional customer service. Lowe’s associates assist in a number of different departments, such as paint, carpet, gardening, lighting, and many other departments. Sometimes, and depending on the location, a sales associate with Lowe’s must perform other duties for the store, such as cashier and warehouse work."
good,A great company to work for if you like interacting with people in a retail atmosphere.
good,"I work in the garden dept.so I'm in a garden all day fronting shelves restocking flowers or watering the flowers .Loading mulch or soil, pavers for customers.  My co-workers are some of the sweetest people I have come to know. The season is almost come to an end and I don't want it to.Customers all day but a customer that doesn't speak English well to be able understand them and see a smile because together we found what the customer wanted to purchase, I find very rewarding."
good,Working at Lowe's enhanced my hands on skills. I've learned about different products from grass seeds to stain products for decking. It's a great place to develop relationships with customers; not only do they seek answers but share their experiences from different products
good,"A typical day would completely drain you at Lowes. I would come in to the store being busy, which is a good thing but the lack of help always has me frustrated. Being a Head Cashier I practically run everything and everyone included the employees on the floor. Customer service is ran by associates that seem to not go the extra mile to get things done. I have to gives overrides for the whole store, unlock grills, chairs, propane cages, and hit receiving for stock, labels trash bags, etc. all at the same time. And not to mention handle emails and corporate issues, while grabbing internet orders and doing a audit. All this on one person. When I ask a manager for help, maybe to just handle a line of customers, they claim they are too busy. No back up is the part I dislike otherwise I would love my job. one head cashier a shift. Sometimes I don't get a lunch or Im to scared the store would fall apart to take one. I love the fact that we do great in sales. I love pleasing customers especially the ones that need you the most. I just would like a job that is lead by team players. I wish everyone would benefit and all be leaders. I wish management would back you up, at all times. So maybe ill have the energy to play with my children when I get home and also the time to enjoy life."
good,"I started working at Lowes in November of 2013 and i enjoyed it throughly. It is a bit laid back which can sometimes be a negative of a work environment because not much work is done by employees. Besides that , i enjoy helping customers and earning my paycheck. I like my coworkers that take the initiative to help a customer and coworker without hesitation. The hardest part of the job is lack of teamwork in some departments. This makes it alot harder to get things done."
good,"Enjoy constantly being on the move manipulating stock."
good,I was in a seasonal position in the electrical department. I assisted customers with electral problem and lighting. I stocked and front faced inventory. I checked the inventory levels.
good,"fun place to work, busy during the Summer times. Management was fair."
good,requires being able to work as a team. and the ability to follow directions
good,"load unload equipment, deliveries all over the state sometimes, out of state also."
good,I was lucky to find an administrative position with Lowe's that paid a competitive wage and a set schedule. It has worked very well with my family and young children while furthering my education.
good,"I used to work in the distribution for 12 hours daily, its a very exhausting job, but I my co-workers will make it better and the managers will focus in safety and production."
good,Working at Lowe's can be challenging at times especially with the variety of customers.  Management is very supportive always asking how the day is going and saying that if I need any help to just let them know.  Co-workers easy to get along and will help in a heart beat.  The hardest part is dealing with some customers that thing that they are the only ones to be helped.  The most enjoyable part is doing the physical labor.
good,Lowes was an alriht place to work.  I learned that managers don't always have the best interest in mind of their employees.  I love working outside.
good,"Typical retail working environment. No overtime, declining workplace"
good,"Personally I liked my job at Lowe's, I would still be if I was full time, but a part time position is not enough to support the family. It is a good work enviornment nice people, and some managers know what they are doing, while others don't. The most enjoyable part of Lowe's is the people that I worked with, some anyways. The hardest part is that everything thing that comes through the store is heavy, so you will definitely work hard, and work up a sweat."
good,Lowe's is a fun place to work with better pay than most plays that hire college students but they have a very stingy policy with raises which is why I decided to look for something else. I started at $8.57 which was about fair for my seasonal job as a cart retriever and then when I learned cashiering and was made permanent got a nice raise to $9.77. The problem is they won't give you a raise if you get a promotion unless you're either a specialist or manager and that takes years at Lowe's. They make you wait a year from every position change to get a raise which kills any drive to want to move up in the company.
good,I work alone for 5 hours once my work is completed come out my office and join my team members on the floor supervising and managing the front end of the store. the hardest part of my job was not to take customers  problems personal attend to over due my work. the most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co wokers and assisting the customers .I learned a lot from lowes how to manage money and be a leader
good,"It was a productive place to work, the management was easy to talk to and customers were great."
good,"multi task between customers, inventory, displays , brand management ,shrink , sales ,training and development. always something to do ad the pay is ok."
good,good work atmosphere but unclear directions and little help getting issue resolved
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers with any and every question they had. Any and every problem as well. "
good,"Very interesting to develop the Supply Chain from scratch, my averyday job was to design the way the supply chain was going to work for Lowes in Mexico. This represented a very big challenge but also a huge oportunity to apply all my knowledge, and learn new things."
good,"A typical day at work consist of fronting materials, unloading truck, use of forklifts to take down merchandise from top racks to lower racks. During the day was helping customers. what I learned how to be a better customer representative. Management was ok as my coworkers they where great people. Hardest part of this job is just finishing your pack down list and helping customers. The most enjoyable part of this job is you meet all walks of life and talk to a lot of people"
good,"Overall it was a good place to work. Management was good."
good,"Management is o.k pay is o.k job itself fun.  A little to micro manger could not be a free thinker, consistently was told but upper management here is your budget for the month but you can only sale limited quantities and if the customer wont's more then what they were limited too they are then told they have to wait a week before it will comes in and the product is more then the shelf price."
good,"Lowe's offered me a fun, safe and comfortable workplace. The company goes out of its way to accommodate its employees for any situation and also offers great training opportunities that help its employees benefit."
good,"I had worked at Lowe's for 8 years.  I was half and half with it.  While there were plenty of good, it was met with almost as much bad.  If workers were any kind of motivated, they could learn a lot from Lowe's   I worked in Delivery my first 2 years.  I got the opportunity to explore a lot of Western Kentucky.  I met a lot of new people during this time, visiting people in their homes, and I learned how to hook up appliances.  I also learned how to drive the moffitt (forklift mounted on the back of a flatbed semi.  I unloaded the store flatbed on job sites when delivering product.  I did also drive various different powered equipment (counterbalance forklift, reach truck and order picker).  I did learn a lot about plumbing and electrical work in my time there, as I spent the last couple of years there covering both departments."
good,"Managed subordinates"
good,"ok job, fun people, can be rewarding at times. there were good managers and bad managers, but overall it was a good experience"
good,"this company pushes you to better yourself in selling ability, facility management, product knowledge, and forces you to think quickly and make decisions in the spur of the moment."
good,"Operate power equipment"
good,ok to work for but the workload to your team ratio wasnt up to par they kept way too small of a team for their receiving team and often we would have to skip our break just to be able to finnish our work before the shift was over
good,"The now defunct commission sales program helped to pay my way through college and pay my bills while working part-time. Now thats gone, it doesnt appeal to me anymore."
good,"A typical day at work includes:"
good,Good company over all however I am looking for more. I want a company that will alowe me to grow.
good,this was my first job there would be a lot of down times but when it was busy work seemed to fly by really started like the job when I moved to the paint department
good,"Overnight shift, Not for a Family Man, Basic retail environment with limited competition"
good,Working at Lowe's is fun because I learn something new everyday. My co workers are helpful whenever I need them. The hardest part of the job is learning how to process different orders. The best part is how much you can have with not only co  workers but also customers.
good,A regular day for me is usually busy I am always moving making sure customers are finding everything they need to to get there project done. I have to make sure my isles are clean when i leave the store at night and i have to operate forklift and other machinery.
good,fun work place with alot of fun people to with they make the day go by fast and make working there enjoyable
good,"Make sure everything is fully stocked, garden center was watered - clean, help customers with any questions they had on projects. Learned how to be an effective team player and work with many different types of people. Co-workers can be both hardworking or a slacker. It was nice to be able to see a happy customer after fulfilling their needs."
good,This job had great pay and had good hours. Majority of the people I worked with while I was there were very friendly and helpful . This job did have a high turn over rate . Training was the most fun part of the job. While i was there I was in school and they were not very good at working with school schedules.
good,"Great place to network, you learn a lot about home repairs. Managers can be either easy going or tough to work with but I suppose it is the same any place you work. Designing kitchens is fun but i wish there was commission."
good,"Typical day at Lowe's is fast paced, being a sales associate in a fast paced environment keeps you going and makes the days go by fast."
good,"A typical day at this employer consisted of me operating different types of warehouse equipment to retrieve and stage merchandise with. While employeed with this employer, I learned how operate several different types of warehouse equipment and gaining thorough knowledge of warehouse operations process. The management here was very structured, supportive, and informative when it came to new opportunities. My co-workers were very entertaining, friendly, and quick to help if needed. One of the most challenging and hardest parts of the job was learning how to operate some of the warehouse equipment. However, once mastering the skill it became the most enjoyable part of it as well."
good,They were very structured and kept all associates very busy. They do pay attention to safety.
good,"Lowe's takes care of their hard workers, many different areas to work in, they like to promote from within,"
good,"I would like to work for a company that has a low turn over with employees. A company that feels more like a family rather than strangers in the same place. I would love to have benefits and 401K. The most important factor in finding a new job is the hours. My previous job would be full time one week and the next down to10 hours. I need something extremely stable. I love talking with people as well as typing. I find it fascinating to learn new things that can become a habit in my everyday life. The hardest part of a job is finding what you need to maintain your lifestyle without compromising family. I would like to have co-workers that are team players and don't mind coming together to be more productive when needed. I would like to have management that is easy to talk to and understanding. From all my past jobs I have learned to always do my best, work hard, remain positive and upbeat regardless of any situations. And to always work to learn more and think about the bigger picture at the end of the day."
good,I move from department to department as siting customers with their shopping experience.
good,"It was not bad job I worked there for over 7 years, but it was just a job not a career."
good,Target was a great environment to work in  and develop knew skills. Coworkers and management made you feel comfortable and easy to talk too.
good,"was hired on with the knowledge I had and was able to advance with more knowledge within the company, better to help the customers with their needs."
good,"A typical day consisted of interacting with a variety of individuals and personalities and ensuring that each individual receives the best customer service possible. I've handled customers shopping for single small items, to professionals building large scale, and very expensive, projects. I learned patience when dealing with people even in the event that they were unruly and belligerent. I also learned how to work and coordinate with people in different departments who possessed different goals and aspirations. Management was very structured and you were expected to follow the chain of command which could sometimes become a nuisance if you didn't get along with your immediate supervisor. I enjoyed working with most, but as in most work environments there were some who were unwilling to be team players; in which case, it's necessary to circumvent those individuals and ensure the customer is taken care of. The hardest part of the job, was dealing with angry, pugnacious and impatient people. It required a lot of energy to be certain that you do not become combative and maintain control and professionalism. The most enjoyable part, was getting the opportunity to meet new and different people and creating a good rapport and possibly external relationships with certain customers."
good,Lowes was a good opportunity to interact one on one with customers and gain customer service skills.
good,"I would work for this company again. They were fairly flexible with my school schedule, and I learned many new skills that are beneficial in a customer service oriented environment."
good,Great pay and work experience in retail. Typical day would be helping customers and mixing paint for the color they desire. A lot of heavy lifting.
good,mid career employee that has dealt with every conceivable problem to include things from snow days that very few employees show up to work to  armed robberies.
good,"The company as a whole is a great company to work for. The pay was really good. The down fall was that you had to work rotating shifts and would mis out on a lot with your family. The job is very demanding pyhsicaly. The management has major comunication issues and there was favortisum that went on. Thecoworks for the most part were very hlepful and we all played as a team. Most of my days being in a management postion consisted of working freight, down stocking, working on paper work that I was recuired to complete, ordering up on freight and making sure the deptartment was in a well working manner."
good,Very good part time job and willing to work around schedules.
good,"Daily combination of multitasking any number of the following:   working with customers in the store, setting up measurements for installations, working up estimates with returned measures, verifying raw materials for installs and DIY projects, customer contact before during and after installation, working screens in order management to maintain working record of each transaction, keeping displays and pricing in working order and up to date, loading and unloading special order and instock raw materials for installers and customer with power equipment, any number of vendor related task when not available, working in store reports to increase store profitability and decrease shrink, training new hires specifically in knowledge to be more efficient in sales, teaching how to clinics on installation of flooring products, and making commercial calls to established commercial customers and going out to community at large to create new financial oppurtunities."
good,The customers were the highlight of the work day. Enjoyed helping them out. Most co workers were lazy and avoided helping. They would leave sections and disappear to break room often. Managers took no accountability. They played favorites and allowed certain behavior which would be unacceptable towards another employee
good,The job was alright but was looking for something different.
good,Better than the average retail experience but still has its flaws.
good,"This was a great place to work.  The co-workers are taught team work, which  really helps people learn."
good,"I cleaned the bathrooms, swept floors, cleaned the offices, changed the trash as needed. I learned how to operate a floor scrubber. The majority of the management team, I feel requires more training. I feel that the training period that the are required to follow thru is not extensive enough. The position that I held was not a difficult job, I enjoyed the duties that was required of me."
good,Had to assist a lot of customers with the items needed to improve their homes.  Fun working environment.
good,it was ok to work there just unfriendly staff and management
good,"got forklift certified, drove semi to make deliveries, been with lowe;s for 14 years in march, had great bunch of drivers and riders,"
good,Overall it would be good. I enjoyed working there. When told that i needed to transfer I was told by the oncoming HR manager that I had to Apply for the job and hopefully I would get the position. I applied for 4 different jobs and all came back with the same automated response.
good,"Good place to be employed with  ,busy on days of major deliveries"
good,"Everyday routine on the go."
good,"As a full-time head cashier, I was responsible for physically checking the store's front-end activities where other cashiers are working, maintaining customer service, working behind a register, monitoring entrance/exit doors, and ensuring loss prevention."
good,Lots of great products and I learned so much about them to teach customers.
good,"I would work an 8 hour shift attending to several departments, some of which I was not that familiar with at all. Management never satisfied with your work considering the amount of work you had to do. Customers always complaining about not enough people around to assist them."
good,Good company. met great people.  Flexible with scheduling needs.
good,I had found out I was pregnant.  They didn't treat me right. I was cursed out by a manager in front of customers.
good,"great place to work"
good,Hated the coporate level management changes. the whole environment went down the tubes.
good,This was a job where you came in and you walked around aimlessly doing nothing. Not my type of enviroment. I had much more potential and it was being wasted at that job. That's why I joined the Marine Corps. The co-workers were very complacent. No motavation at all. The hardest part of the job was not being able to show my potential and being acknowlegde for it. It was great when I had customers that seeked my help out specifically and they were helped and satisfied.
good,Treated me right and did a great job keeping me happy and involved with the company.
good,"This is an interesting place to work at mainly because you get to learn which products work best for different situations. Just like anywhere else you would deal with an array of customers. If you choose to work for Lowe's the better positions to have would be full-time or specialist, because when its time to cut hours part-timers get cut dramatically."
good,"Lowes was okay work place, typical day was taking lead for new installations and measurements. Cleaning and stoking merchandize."
good,"managers flirting with employees, very poor. Lots of drama, starting pay is okay but then you barely get a raise.  You get like ten cents to 25 cents a year, so if you want more money and you want your bank account to grow this is not the job for you.  They are so cheap they don't have a janitor, the cashiers have to clean the bathrooms after closing, very gross."
good,Worked with some Great people. Learned the business of special ordering.
good,"My typical day is supposed to be helping customers with remodeling of their homes, water heater installations,and bathroom renovations. Due to the cutting of staff and hours, my typical day is helping customers with their plumbing problems and recommending the right parts and products to solve their problems. I have become excellent with my plumbing product knowledge and customer service in the plumbing department. Management is fair and they are nice people, but they are under a lot of pressure due to the staffing cuts and hours being cut for pat-time and weekend workers. Co-workers are excellent people and hard workers but the morale is low because they are being push to their limits by staffing and hours being cut. The hardest part of my day is trying to provide excellent customer service when their are several customers trying to get my attention at the same time. I enjoy my job the best when a customer thanks me for providing excellent customer service."
good,"Lowe's was a good company to work for while I was going to college. However, I had no plan to remain. Retail is just not a long term career for me."
good,"receiving and unloading of incoming deliveries. I learned time management, leadership, and prioritization. overall the management was easy to work for. the co-workers were hardworking and wonderful to supervise. the long days and physical exertion were the hardest part of the job. good people to work with"
good,"I learned how to work in a warehouse, load and unload trucks, but some of the managers were not very people oriented which was the hardest part of the job."
good,Good work environment long working days atleast 35 hours a week
good,"Nice company, some workers may lack professionalism. I deal with customers, provide service with a smile, educate customers on products, load and unload vehicles, loss prevention."
good,"As a stepping stone back into the world of working, my time at Lowe's has been well spent.  Learning the different customer types has been beneficial, as well.  My co-workers have made this experience an enjoyable one.  Standing for 8 hr shifts, on concrete, in the heat during summer and cold during winter have made me appreciate the luxuries of a desk job. When I have a chance to help a customer meet their need, that makes the shift worth it."
good,"No benefits"
good,A typical day would consist of helping customers with their projects. Communicating with the customers and helping them was the best part of the job.
good,Fast paced enviroment.  Constant schedule changes for retail hours.
good,"On the surface, it was an exciting job. Once in the field, problems would arise that required improvising and compromising safety for customer satisfaction.Equipment was poorly maintained and constantly broke down, there were not enough tools to do the job, and management was difficult to reach in dire situations."
good,This is a good opportunity to start a career.  A typical work day is busy all day.
good,Lowe's was a good place to work because of the job security and opportunities for advancement.
good,"Good Clean environment, positive energy, good customer interaction. Lack of hours."
good,"I was a Zone Manager for Lowes in Avon, IN where I managed one of the most consistently busy areas within the region."
good,"Responsible for providing quick, friendly customer service by answering customers questions"
good,"If you are slightly insane, have no life outside of your job, can handle daily complaints - relentlessly, can tolerate customers whining, threats to sue, ignorance, arrogance, and hold their hand through a resolution.. if you can deal with the obsurd with a smile, appease management and make tough financial decisions that will ultimately fall back on you.. if you can make house calls to hoarders and have the backbone to show up at a disgruntled customer's home with no bullet proof vest.. if you can manage expenses and project manage and have good time management skills.. if you can comfort your employees after a customer exploded on them and then call that customer back yourself.. if you can interface with all departments, vendors & customers, multi task nonstop, reply to emails with caution, cover your butt and keep a clear mind.. if you have knowledge of installation and are quick to learn.. if all of this is Ok with you, then you can do it. Join the ranks of the slightly insane and the most overlooked thankless position with the company. The rewards are your personal satisfaction and knowing you did your best. If you're Ok with that, you can do it. Not for the faint of heart. Be for warned.. it takes a special breed. Be sure you know what you're getting into. If you're not scared off by this review, you can do it!"
good,"hot, boring, good workout though, good discounts for employees"
good,I was working here when i was in high school. I want a higher paying job and something more physical.
good,"Good place, fun to work other. Help out in all areas if they need it. Stay late to get everything ready for the next day."
good,"A typical day of work at Lowe's entailed heavy lifting, working with the power equipment and pallet jacks, distributing and stocking the freight, and customer service. For the most part management was friendly. I liked working with my co-workers some of them went above and beyond to make sure the job got done. What I found hard about the job was the heavy lifting aspect although I did like it. The most enjoyable part of my job was the freight team that I worked with. We all worked great together."
good,"My everyday agenda consists of reviewing several types of reports to ensure audit compliance; processing/validating monetary deposits/loans/pick ups; managing store supplies; editing/inputing employee schedules/rotations; providing excellent customer service to any and all customers I come in contact with, provide assistance on sales floor and up front on register where ever help is needed as well as acting Manager On Duty to resolve any complaints or concerns from customers/employees when other salaried managers are not available."
good,"working in garden section and indoor, everyone very helpful co workers, management was ok very hard to find management, hgardest part of job staying up on location of product, customers and employers"
good,"Great place to work at. Floors were hard on your body, yet home improvement is needed by everyone."
good,Great place to work with great people to work with and lot of opportunities to grow.
good,"normal day at work"
good,"I like what I do and would like to continue to work at Lowe's, but I feel that there is not going to be any real chances for job advancement at this facility. I like to know that I have, at the very least a chance for advancement. I hired on at Lowe's Companies, because the saying that they use is ""Lets Build Your Future Together"". When I am told that there will only be one mechanic, that tells me that I will not be the manager over that person."
good,"i stocked all the shelfs will the other workers walked around, only a handful of people actually worked there. The management was decent but could have been better. The hardest part of the job was putting up with the lazy people. the most enjoyable part was seeing my friend coworkers there."
good,"not sure"
good,"There are a lot of options as far as career advancement in Lowe's. There are different jobs such as specialist, pro, department manager, and so on. Co-workers are very nice and friendly and always work together as a team. There are always clear goals set forth for us to accomplish."
good,"greet and assist customers in every way possible"
good,Stock shelves and assist customers. Assemble patio furniture.
good,"Department manager, managing three part-time and two full-time employees, making sure that the employees had current work lists to do during their shift.  Scheduled employees to make sure that my department always had coverage.  If another department needed coverage I would work both my department and the other department.  Did yearly inventory with Washington Inventory services, accounting for all inventory in our warehouse.  Utilized pallet jacks, electric jack, fork-lift, sit-down fork-lift to unload trailers as they came in to replenish stock in the warehouse.  Used cherry-picker to stock overhead departments and used stand-up fork-lift to pallets on top stock.  Open and closed store with the manager.  Stocked shelves, assisted customers, made displays, checked inventory against what was in the system.  Set up end caps with displays and advertised sales displays were up.  Did monthly price audit to ensure that price changes were current and up to date."
good,"We would go over sales, and let associates know all of our sales goals."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's because, not only was it a good paying job, good benefits and decent hours, I also learned a few things.  The job overall wasn't very hard at all, help people with their specific questions, mix and match paints, downstock and restock during down time."
good,"Realy did not enjoy working here, the managers were very unfriendly and did not see much of a growing oppurunity here"
good,"Cash handleing skills, customer service, light cleaning around the work area."
good,at times can be very rewarding and can also be very misleading
good,"A typical day at work consisted of unloading the truck and sorting them for the overnight crew. An employee at Lowe's comes in contact with hundreds of people a day, I loved the people i worked with, it was a great environment. I learned a lot in terms of customer service, how to handle people, communication skills, it was generally a good experience"
good,It was an enjoyable place to be. Had some great coworkers who made me feel comfortable when I was working. Management was fair in their decisions.
good,I learned a lot about selling. And adding value to different customer's. The associates were very fun to coach and work with. Everyday there was something different to do.
good,Although I enjoyed the people I worked with at Lowe's; I would not want to work there for a lifetime.
good,A typical day consisting of usual retail duties such as inventory and freight flow and stocking.  Customer interaction.
good,Start off with cleaning the restrooms.  Move on to things in the store that need to be fixed.  Calling vendors about machine issues.
good,"watering outside and inside plants, customer service, I learned how to be part of a team by taking a leadership role, my coworkers were supportive, the hardest part of the job was the Modesto heat, but I enjoyed meeting new people the most"
good,I am always learning about new products that come in to all the different departments. most of management and my co-workers are very helpful with anything that is new to our job such as new paperwork or different ways to find the products we may need to get to help our customers. the hardest thing I do is trying to figure out what first time renovators are trying to accomplish because some times they are not even sure. the most satisfying thing is when the customer comes back just to thank you for your help and knowledge on their task and to see how satisfied they are with a job done right.
good,100% customer service provided daily. Helping the to meet all expectations of customers hardware needs.
good,"Management sucks don't speak English,not organized company. treated like slaves"
good,"I did a lot for this employer, there wasn't much room for advancement. I left because I received the job at DHS"
good,"customer service, inventory, dayshifts nightshifts and get to meet different people"
good,When I am at work I have a very independant job. There are not very many associates whom understand just what it is that I do. Ireturn items that are defective to thier manufacture. When a company stands behinde the product the they sell they will allow us to return it for the customer and they will compensate the store so that it is not concidered a loss. I have trained many of my co-workers on how to make their jobs easier and in turn making things a little more organized for myself. The hardest part of the job is staying on top of all the items that get returned. It can get very disorganized if you do not prioritize your work list.
good,Lowe's is a company always looking in a upward direction on making the best customer experience they can from the time they enter the store until they exit the store.
good,"A typical day at work requires patience and understanding of customer and associate needs. You will be standing for 6-8 hours of your shift and expected to require no additional breaks other than your lunch. Management is sub-par depending on who your department falls under, I think your chances to succeed are based on who you suck up to or make a great impression with. Advancement is minimal and I would suggest finding a stable outside job if you plan on being a part-time employee here. The associates and customers are the best part of the job, assuming you get along with all of them. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a select few stubborn associates that feel above you or your fellow associates and those customers who just want you to feel like dirt and give them everything they want at a discount or refund. The most enjoyable part is socializing and assisting the customers who look to the associate for help/second opinion. Overall, Lowe's is a great place to work if you are going to school or looking for a job that  will get experience with customer service and sales under your belt. It can be a great long-term company to be with if you get ""in"" with the right managers/associates, but do not expect to just come in do your job and leave."
good,My co-workers are amazing. I love every single on of them along with a couple managers.
good,The best part of the job is the people you work with.  There are some interesting people that I work with.  Then on the other hand I think the building is very poorly run.  We do so much extra handling of the product it is stupid.
good,Consistent hours and relaxed work environment. Everyone was pretty laid back and nearly all employees were willing to help one another if needed.
good,never a slow moment clean the entire store part of the safty team co workers are great management is ok i dislike the bathrooms
good,"A typical day consist of answering phones, completing, and pulling internet orders,answering customer questions, and resovling customer conplaints. At Lowe's I have learned loyal customer value, and that sometimes going out of your way can be rewarding. Management is very helpful and suppostive, my co-workers are fun people to be around. The hardest part of the job is the unstable schedule and the changes in hours. One week you can work 36 hours and the next you can be cut down to 13 hours making it diffcult to maintain a household. The great sense of humor is nost enjoyable and managements willingness to listen."
good,"A TYPICAL WORK DAY"
good,"on a daily basis I tendered transactions, handled large sums of cash, promoted and sold credit cards. assisted customers."
good,Not a bad place to work. Benefits fairly affordable. Being a good worker meant that sometimes you got work piled on while others didn't do much.
good,I didn't like the managers and they treated their employees horrible.
good,As a cashier I got the opportunity to interact with customers and develop great home improvement skills. Upper management treats workers like numbers or robots. I enjoyed interacting with new people and providing friendly customer service. Loss prevention seemed more focused on profiling customers rather than them as human beings.
good,Lowes as all company are getting to be very customer focused which is a good thing. I am happy for the time and knowledge that I received while at Lowes.
good,"Learned a lot about the products sold at Lowes"
good,"A typical day at Lowes is just like any day in Retail. It's fast paced and you meet so many different kind of people. I have never worked in retail before so working at Lowes really made me appreciate all the had work of the  people who have worked in retail for years. I now take into consideration how I will act in a store and treat an employee at that store that I visit. The hardest part of the job is the down time. At times it becomes slow when no one is shopping, and because I like to keep moving when I'm at work, it's easy for me to get bored. Around certain times of the night when I have done all my tasks, and there is nothing left for me to do at the Customer Service desk, and no one is in the store shopping, for me time drags on. The most enjoyable part of my job are my co-workers. They make it fun. It's a big group of different and diverse people, and I enjoy getting to know them."
good,"•	Cashier"
good,Lowe's was a great company to work for. I loved working with all the customers and helping them with their needs.
good,i still love working at lowes just wish some things could be different
good,Responsible for building project build quotes for commercial accounts in a high paced working environment.
good,Learned a lot and worked with great people at a couple of the Georgia stores.
good,It's a job that is is something to do until something better comes along. No matter how qualified you are it seems there is no chance for advancement unless you are buddy buddy with the manager
good,"Good job over all, the managers could be a little nicer and they could pay a little more, but over all its a good place to work. long hours over night. got to sleep all day"
good,depending what location you are at it can be a great work experience
good,"There is a lot of simply standing around, waiting. When there is down time, you find yourself cleaning the barbeque grills that are outside in the wind. "
good,"Typical day at work started by cleaning bathrooms, then I would sweep and mop.  Take out the trash and do tasks around the store for the remainder of the shift."
good,A typical work day at Lowes would be unloading freight trucks or appliance trucks and puuting up freight. I learned alot working at Lowes mainly working in a Corporate place. The co-workers are usually really nice but its just like any other job you have a handful of people who arent quite friendly . The managers are really nice and helpful. The most enjoyable part of my job was being off on weekends.
good,The pay is not the best but they gave me a job when I needed it so for that I am grateful.
good,how to get along with the public and get things done on time. I had a manager I didn't like at that time but did the best I could do at all times . They don't have any respect for they employee's
good,it was a overall good place to work. the managment was very good but they lacked communication.
good,Lowe's is a large retail store that generally runs with 5-7 managers and 100+ employees.  Lowe's has a great benefit package and offers a progressive bonus structure for management.
good,delivered loads to customers homes and work sites. learned about teamwork to get the job done. management could use a little help. other co-workers are friendly and knowledgable. hardest part is dealing with customers. enjoyable part is getting out of store and cruising the roads.
good,Rotating shift matrix week to week. Random shifts to work. Managers over different departments but don't have much to say about how their departments run. Assistant Managers don't do much with departments unless having to get onto someone. The hardest part about the job is figuring out which manager to listen to.
good,Working with the public and helping people connect with with what they need.
good,I pulled orders and stocked shelves. I would also cut wood for customers and help them find the products they needed.
good,"Merchandise products for Lowe's, The store that I happen to work at is a high performing retail store that is very busy."
good,"medical setting, fast paced ,organized, great work place loved interacting with the people and employees"
good,Coaches are weak on process and lack ability to motivate employees.
good,"At this Lowe's, it has become several people's (not only my own) experiences that if you are not a favorite among management, YOU WILL NOT MOVE UP in the company.  This is definitely not a career choice, although the pay is good if you're on the new pay scale AND if you have YEARS AND YEARS of experience in customer service.  I would only recommend people who needed a small part time job or students in college just needing a small paycheck to work here.  Anyone struggling to get a full time job (or any respect) will only struggle harder by working here."
good,This place would be great for someone who loves working retail. Personally i did not like working in the retail side of the work world
good,"scheduled 11 hour day, short staffed everyday, expected to deliver miracles daily"
good,I directed a customer service driven team.  I monitored product 						displays and placement daily.  I was in direct consultation and 							engagement with manufacturers.  I also implemented product 							marketing techniques based on customer and manufacturers inputs.
good,a typical work day includes directing customers to the things they need
good,"ok working conditions, all depends on the manager for the day, some better than others"
good,"I used to load lumber for the lumber department and load for the garden area, I was always on the move and only get a 30 minute break and two 15 minute breaks and they would go by fast cause I had a lot to do. If you want to get in good shape take this position."
good,Able to bring my experience to the floor and train associates. Felt we had a great team. Lowes was going through changes and updating the Culture and Values.
good,"I ordered plants, unloaded plant trucks, watered and maintain plants.Customer service was the most important thing.The management was great there, as well as my co-workers.I had some very long hours there. Most of the time we were short handed."
good,"I learned a lot from working here, from cashier technology to customer interactions leading to upselling whilst providing great customer satisfaction."
good,"For the last six plus years I have enjoyed working for Lowe's, I learned how to give great customer service to create repeat customers. A major part of my job consisted of me training and developing my front end associates to do the same. I have enjoyed my time spent with this company. I learned several things as an Administrative Department Manager while assisting with Human Resource responsibilities, now I have an interest in HR. I am currently pursuing my degree in Human Resource. I can take all the knowledge that I learned dealing with external customers and use it to help the internal customers. While I am very consistent with how I manage, I learned that you can not manage every person the same. For me the hardest part of working for Lowe's is the inconsistent work shifts. I have a young  child who will soon start school, and I want to create some type of balance for him. The most enjoyable part of what I do is assisting both the external and internal customers get what they need to add value to their personal projects or to their life."
good,"I worked different shifts all the time. It wasn't a bad place to work, it just didn't work out."
good,very good job if u like riding around on a forklift I personally like working outside 
good,This job is pretty laid back. Fun place to work. Great management. Hardest part was probably keeping pricing straight. 
good,"• Served as a customer service representative"
good,"A typical work day consisted of fast pace, multi-tasking beteen computer screens.  Taking care of all customers problems regarding internet orders, in store orders, register, and doing returns and exchanges."
good,My typical day at Lowes is helping customers with their shopping needs and maintaining inventory management. Making sure the my department is clean and ready for the customer needs is also a top priority. I enjoy working with my fellow associates and they are part of the reason I enjoy working at Lowes. The hardest part of working at Lowes is every customer requires different services which keeps you on your toes. The most enjoyable is being able to help people with the needs.
good,Working at Lowe's is an experience in customer service. The volume of people the employee interacts with on a daily basis will help anyone looking to improve their people skills. The customer knowledge ranges from no knowledge to skill artisans. The most important lesson is practice active listening techniques with ever customer and give the boss what they want. Once that lesson is learned settle in and enjoy the atmosphere.
good,"A typical day at work is full of instructions from 3 to 4 differnt manegers, department maneger, area manager, store manager and the manager on duty all have authority to put a task in your hands. At any given moment what you are doing can be over ruled by any of the managers walking by."
good,I worked very hard on a daily basis and only ever wanted everyone else to give the same effort as I did. That drive was also the reason I do not work with Lowe's at the current time.
good,"Lowes is an OK company overall.  Not the best place to work, but not the worst.  Management could use some improvement, some just do not know how to talk to people.  Job stability is not good, if you are hired as seasonal help."
good,"Performed maintenance and troubleshooting on conveyors, electric forklifts, and AC units.  I learned all different aspects of maintenance.  The managment was okay.  My co-workers were okay.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the heat inside the warehouse during the summer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working on the forklifts."
good,Lack of communication with management. Too much drama among co-workers.
good,I had much fun as an employee of LOWES! I had a lot of  great managers that cared about the products and customers which made it a great work place
good,"I enjoy what I do, but not please with some management members. "
good,"always something to do and observations of people to make"
good,"Pretty good place to work overall.. ]"
good,"Just like any other retail store or employment, your experience may vary depending on your co-workers. To be efficient, use proper communication skills and maintain friendly appearance."
good,enjoyed working with customers and garden plants.  enjoyed working with coworkers and learnt a lot
good,"Aided customers while I restocked and accounted for merchandise"
good,"Great work environment, great coworkers. Unprofessional management, and the training material was very out-dated."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening the register, answering phone calls, handling customer complaints and questions, tracking orders, sending faxes, greeting and cashing out customers, and telling them to come again.  I learned about home improvement and how to do some basic repairs.  The management was a separate group from the employees and did not work on the same level as me.  They were often inconvenienced when asked a question.  The hardest part of the job was answering questions about things I did not know the answer to.  The most enjoyable part was working in outside lawn and garden and getting great ideas for my own home and that I could share with customers."
good,I first qualified as a truck unloader. I was then directed to stocking merchandise on freights. All freights had to be taken to their corresponding department. All merchandise had to be stocked in empty bases. My other part of the job consisted of client service. I had to give the best costumer service by helping each costumer with any questions and direct them to any department in the store.
good,"Big Box Store, not really for me. I did learn a lot about building materials and home improvement while employed here."
good,"Good company to work for, great discount, nice place to meet new people. "
good,Only reason I am not still there is because they closed. Great co-workers. Liked interacting with the customers.
good,Very busy company. This a home improvement store so customers were always buying things to upgrade their homes or business.
good,Lowes is a good company to work for. They care about their customers more then anything and not so much about their employees. I believe that the powers that may be showed more appreciate Lowes would be one of the best company's to work for.
good,"it was okay to work here. they pay pretty wellProvided excellent customer service by displaying product knowledge to customers. Used the knowledge of paint and various home improvement projects to satisfy customers project needs. By keeping up to the date inventory on products was able to more quickly provide customers with what they needed. Covered other departments when called upon by mangers including cutting blinds, shades, cash register, carts, etc. Trained in multiple departments and equipment. Assist customers in checking out, return items, help customers load cars. on in the workforce."
good,Decent pay and benefits. Management has something to learn.
good,Because I'm female I was talked to like I didn't know anything. It's not body friendly standing on concrete all day but it wasn't the worst job I've ever had.
good,"In my opinion, this was a good first job. I felt that the store that I worked at lacked some communication skills, but most of my fellow co workers were very friendly. I also felt that the customers were a lot more willing to teach me about what they do and teach me what things were used for. That made me look forward to going into work each day."
good,"Your days change from opening one day to closing the next. You schedule is posted each week so it is hard to plan anything in advance. "
good,typical days at work there are fast paced it can get busy right outta nowhere
good,only worked part time would not move me up to full time plus no benefits
good,"1.Have to meet deadlines."
good,it was fun I enjoy working there but the people that train me didnt train me very well that I had to train myself it was a seasonal job but it was a experience to my knowledge
good,i went in and did my stocking and was a cashier i got along well wuth the other co-workers i liked meeting new people
good,"Work on a rotation schedule, learn a lot about your position, great training opportunities, enthusiastic staff, sometimes understaffed for sales volume.  "
good,it payed good and there security was not what i thought it was supposed to be. they cut alot of things out as time progressed working there. it just became unfair to the employees
good,"A busy work environment.  Many different areas, from Paint to Plants."
good,good company for advancement with great co-workers. The long hours are tough to balance work/life.
good,I enjoy working with people and problem solving so I got along well here.
good,"Learn to deal with so many different people."
good,"Lowes is a great company to work for. However, the lack of dedication and/or passion for the job in many of my co-workers create a negative atmosphere.  WE are the heart and soul of our store.  And when passion, enthusiasm, care, responsability, and dedication are not found in the workplace, it does not matter how good of a company it is. The employees make the difference!. Teamwork and respect is key to create a positive environment and a workplace you look foward to going to every day (for the employees as well as for the customers). It all begins with a strong base. It begins with strong managers. And when that base is not as strong as it should be, it all comes crumbling down..."
good,"Helped with my customer service skill, and multi tasking skills."
good,Management wasn't the best. Flexible schedule. Not trained as well as Home Depot. 
good,I enjoyed most of the people I worked with on a daily basis. However when the new store manager arrived the store had a whole new vibe no one working was ever in a good mood. This brought down everyone and made the work day longer and miserable to be there.
good,My typical work day is coordinating with vendors about special orders making sure the order will arrive on time and if not contacting the customer telling them when their order will arrive. Selling special order doors and windows. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers getting what they want. 
good,over worked at times because of the under staffed departments. They will work you hard
good,cust service is important worked her for 4.5 yrs it was a good job
good,"In this position I was responsible for many different aspects of customer service in our store, and the day to day operations of all check outs, returns, and customer service desk.  I was responsible for the speedy and efficient check out of all customers. Allowing our registers to have sufficient change and not an abundance of cash was a responsibility that fell onto me. I was responsible for ensure all cashiers were performing their jobs correctly and efficiently. All customer service issues were brought to me to be handled, which occasionally required me to go between upper management and the customer.  The most rewarding part of the job was being able to take an angry customer and provide them with solutions to their problems and making them happy.  "
good,Worked in the lumber department receiving goods from suppliers and putting the material on the shelves for customers to grab. Helped customers find any material they needed to complete their home projects.
good,"assist customers with purchases, learned a lot about home improvement, co-workers are knowledgeable"
good,"I love working for  Lowes  all managers are good, customers always asking lots of questions. Its a fast environment paced at that store. I sure contribute to that store."
good,I should have stayed with Lowes as a career! I was there for 2 years and moved on to a healthcare career.
good,"I enjoy the physicality of my job as a receiving associate. I don't mind breaking a sweat, and I like to stay active. The job is fairly simple, and has provided me with several certifications to operate power equipment. I get along great with most of the associates throughout the store, and the overall environment is positive. I find management to be less than ideal, as they frequently change our processes with little review of the changes in efficiency, or any real effort to diagnose problems. I also do not appreciate the lack of communication. My favorite part of the day is unloading freight from the trailers, while the hardest is stocking the freight on the floor. This is only difficult because the store manager frequently changes his mind about the order in which he wants things done, which more often than not seems to be much less efficient."
good,"A typical day at Lowes, working with associagtes on different task, billing processing credit cards,checking off trucks, but most dealing with"
good,Worked as a head cashier (team leader) in charge of several individuals and departments.
good,"Has its laid back moments, but the management is always pressuring to do more. Can get overwhelming at times especially if there is no coverage/ help scheduled."
good,decent place to work good people to work with. management couldn't get it together when i worked there
good,"Assisted customers at desk, phones, returns, sales, payments, deliveries."
good,"Most cashier jobs are considered tempory , Cashier have to deal with customers management has to be called if there is a problem. Most co-workers did not stay long."
good,I enjoyed working at my job. I enjoyed the co-workers and management team. Working at my job I have learned many skills that would benefit me for a better career and would as well benefit any work place that I work for in the future.
good,I found that Lowe's worked very well with the constant changing of my schedule due to the changing of classes each semester.
good,"Great work/social life balance. Great pay. Work 8 hour days. Paid 15 minute breaks. Days off are scheduled on a 4 week rotation, thus allowing vacations and events to be planned well in advance."
good,Too much employee/manager personal interaction. Working outdoors was very enjoyable and other employees made the job fun and enjoyable.
good,"A typical day working at Lowes, including dealing with customers. helping them with any possible question they may have, about any particular item. Making sure our customer is satisfied before exiting the store."
good,Learned Inventory control; display sets; chain of command;
good,"Before working at Lowes, I heard what a wonderful company it was. Lowes recently decided to become more customer-oriented than task force like business. Training is very minimal, so I highly recommend to learn everything about home improvement or at least know something before working here. There has been a lot of times where I got thrown out on the floor and interact with customers. It can become very frustrating at times (for you and the customers). Thank goodness, once I see something I tend to remember or get persuaded to learn more. If you're fast on your feet, quick learner, or know a lot about home improvement than this the job for you."
good,Most of th employees are fun to work with. some of the employees do play favorites but I'm okay with that.
good,Prepared product to be loaded onto trailers for shipment to stores.
good,"A good place to work as a stop-gap or entry level position. Lowes provides opportunities to advance, if you want retail management as a goal."
good,Management is easy to work with and understanding of personal needs like college classes/ second jobs. Customers are generally appreciative and don't just assume they know more than you when it comes to your department.
good,Daily you are required to service all assets of the business
good,This company is much like any other retail. The management needed some interpersonal skills with the other employees.
good,Teaching and Training sales associates to create a excellent customer service experience
good,"A typical day at work was a repetative counting tills, balancing tills, recieving money, making deposits and completing and filing the nessacery paperwork. I learned alot about recieving and depositing money. Management was great at first, but once new management came in not so much so. Great co -workers, friendly and fun to be around. Hardest part of the job was the massive amount of paperwork on a daily. Most enjoyable would be the co-works and customers."
good,Typical day consists of working with customers and merchandise stock.
good,The company in a whole is a good company to work depending on the store and there management. But the values Lowes stand for are good values
good,"Exciting,Fun and Challenging always keeping myself busy really enjoyed helping customers with their needs"
good,"This is a Job I had both a huge amount of passion for, and a great deal of angst and frustrations. If you enjoy retail I'm sure its pretty run of the mill. Lowe's is a great company with some serious ambitions, they do a good job at caring for their customers, and are a respectable company to work for. I would work for Lowe's again if the right position and opportunity were available."
good,"I would report to work 30 minutes prior to the store opening and issue tills to all registers. I would then count the deposit from the previous days business. If I had to do both cash office and supervisor, I would schedule all cashiers lunches and breaks upon completion of deposit. I would then print all financial documents required for each days business file. Each overage or shortage greater than $5.00 was researched and explained in detail in the business file. While at Lowe's I learned a lot about how the business operates. I learned a lot about safety, loss prevention, customer service, and management. Management at Lowe's was often individuals who were understanding. They were knowledgeable in each of their departments. I learned that advancement within the company was often based upon who you know rather than what you know. My co-workers at the store level were mostly college students. This often made it challenging to schedule them because they had limited part-time hours. I enjoyed everyone of my co-workers and they all enjoyed working with me. The hardest part of my job was trying to play the role of the greeter, the first person to assist cashiers in any issue, the trainer, and the person responsible for keeping the parking lot cleared from shopping carts all at the same time. It was challenging at times because during peak hours we were required to stay in the very front of the store near the exit door. However, I enjoyed the challenging days the most."
good,"Very good place to work, they give you the tools to succeed. Learned a lot about customer service, great work environment, extremely helpful management. Assisting customers is the best part of this job."
good,I work at Final Finish Painting on my days off from Lowe's. I enjoy my days off due to the work I do.
good,Easy job just jelping customers find items and answering their questions.
good,A typical day at work I would have to deal with a lot of personalities and attitudes working in a customer service environment. The management was pretty down to earth and they treated everyone with respect.
good,great enviorment to work in. great management great teamwork
good,"Knowledge of a wide range of IT standards, principles, concepts, methods, policies, and authorized approaches for IT as well as the full variety of Lowes applications, operating systems and components, protocols, and the hardware and software used in the Lowes organizations in order to conduct system administration functions and study the Lowes Stock IT system problems and identify/develop and implement the best methods, procedures, and processes to resolve such problems, reduce and minimize system failures in critical user business activities and to provide the most effective support for store associates."
good,"Lowes provided me with a stable and encouraging workplace for many years. The best part of the job was the management. Of the retail jobs I have had, Lowes trains their managers using an extensive program that helps them with not only running the business but dealing with and helping employees manage work time and home time. The retail sector is not friendly to a persons lifestyle but Lowes does what they can to soften the blow."
good,working with customers
good,"Honest days work=honest days pay, TEAM work, there is a huge differnce working for Lowe's than at the Orange Box. Alot of self pride in your work."
good,"Lowes was a great place to work, even though I am not the 'tool"" type, I helped in every way that I could and if I was at a loss for words another associate would step in and help out."
good,retail is retail you have busy days and slow days the customers made it all worth it
good,"Decent place to work, friendly staff. It's a lot like Home Depot, just a different color and name! My day is fast paced, and is rather enjoyable. There is the usual stress and demand of retail, as customers and management have demands on you as a customer service rep. The hardest part of the job is making the most of your time to get the most amount of work done in a shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer interaction and getting the customer what they need when they need it."
good,a very busy company I learn something new every day good coworkers the hardest part of the job is to be standing the good part of the job is assist all customers and resolve all situation
good,"It varies on the location, managements and local economy. Working for Lowe's was quite the experience. Retail is a revolving door, so people come and go. Lowe's is a great company, but of course there are bad seeds(stores) that come from the apple."
good,Learned alot when it comes retail and home improvement.
good,Lowe's is generally a great company. I enjoy doing Outside sales because of the challenges it brings daily. I work through issues of every kind and make customers happy daily. It is what I look forward too.
good,if you like working with the public this is the place for you to work . many many different things to learn
good,Retail - Good starter job out of college but that's about it.
good,Working with general public. Helping people daily find the supplies they need to finish their home improvement projects.
good,It's too early for me to offer a comprehensive review as I have only worked a total of 1 week.
good,Head cashier of front end making sure cashiers stay on task and are taking care of customers properly and in a timely manner. Making sure cashiers are recieving breaks and lunches. Opening and closing registers at open/close of each day.
good,I work with customers on their projects and determine what they will need to complete their projects.
good,you're either in a shipping or receiving department and you use different types of forklifts to load and unload product. its hard work but i enjoyed the staff and management due to them always making our work environment better with prizes and company cook outs.
good,I learned how the big box works. Check the computer for daily e-mails. I enjoy working with my co-workers. I enjoy working and i have fun working with all people
good,"I was only with Lowe's for a year, and it's not a bad job for a part time work."
good,"I always knew that retail was not for me, but I moved up quickly at Lowe's going from a regular cashier to the Return desk within a month of working there. You have not dealt with rude people until you work a return desk at any retail establishment."
good,Provided members and prospective members with exceptional customer service by providing a full range of products and services
good,Okay place to work management isnt to bad only thing is they tell you what you want to hear but dont deliver
good,Its a ok place to work but want a new place of employment. the coworkers are nice and trust worthy. Also the hardest part for me pesronaly is all the diffrent and out dated programs they run.
good,Required to assist new and existing clients through sales process from initial greeting to final installation in retail setting.
good,"Cashier, stood around waiting for customers. Extremely slow business. Very boring job"
good,"Working for Lowe's as an assembler consisted of me building and putting together various equipment being sold. There was no interaction with customers and the work day seemed long. I was in the back of the store alone, or with one other guy building things all day. The cons were the silence and ability to relax, but there was no excitement and not being able to talk with the customers and be part of the real shopping experience wasn't ideal."
good,"The hardest part of the job was knowing the different type of flowers they had in the lawn and garden area. Management was good in adjusting hours for employees. The fun part of the job was working in the assembly area putting grills, lawn mowers and etc together."
good,"I needed a better paying job and I got that through Lowes. They give you ok health benefits, 401 K, holiday and sick pay, etc. The schedule can be pretty draining since you can be closing one day at 11 pm and need to be in to open at 5:30 the next morning. Sometimes tasks given from upper management do not make sense but I suppose that is most places."
good,"A typical work day for me, would be me assisting customers with questions and locations of store products and loading store products into customers vehicles. In addition to that, I was in charge of stocking store products and keeping my department clean. As an employee, I felt like I was part of a big working family with my co-workers and managers.Overall I think Lowes is a great company to work for and a great way to learn how to interact with different customers of different cultural backgrounds."
good,"Checkout the customers goods, bag them, and help find where products are. The coworkers were usually extremely friendly."
good,I learned many different things while working at Lowes' I learned a great deal about leadership and teamwork. I really loved the ability to move up in the company if given the opportunity. The hardest part of the job I ever encountered was learning about customers and trying to find the products they were asking.
good,"Most of the people here are good, hard working people. There just seems to be some differences in operational procedures and why things are done. Some things are overlooked on a daily basis, and the ability to obtain employee buy in is severly lacking. There are some good leaders here, but they are only allowed to lead until they reach the end off their leash."
good,"I typical day was at least 2 meetings if not 3 status meetings. I worked 80% of my day in Excel the rest was on the phone. My responsiblities were daunting repetitive tasks. I put together something called EMS documents, which have nothing to do with marketing which was my interest."
good,"The training at lowe's does not truly prepare you to go out on the sell's floor to assist customers, they had a bad habit of putting someone who knows nothing about the product in a particular part of the store."
good,its an ok company to work for. it takes a lot of exercise. but the mangement wasnt the best.
good,"nice environment, good benefits, but not a very good opportunity for advanced wages or job advancement."
good,Only took this job to move back to my home town. they do not care about you unless you are in the top management teir.
good,Good place to work with good people around you. Managers are some what supportive depending on who it is. Is no longer my choice of a career; but would be good for someone starting into retail.
good,"Customer service, worked with cash registers, helped customers in finding items desired"
good,"My day started with me unloading trucks, then"
good,Delivering and installation appliances - Good customer services - Co-worker easy to get alone with - Driving to different locations - Pleasing customer with appliances
good,Main focus during a typical day is the customer. In between helping customers you must down stock and face merchandise. Management is great and very helpful. The hardest part of the job is working so hard for not being paid well.
good,"A good place to work if it has good management and if you have the mental toughness to deal with customers that spent $20,000 to $50,000 in your store and when one little thing goes wrong the want to rip your head off even when its not your flat."
good,When i worked here i enjoyed going to work every day friendly co-workers good managment
good,Lowe's Home Improvement is a very fast paced environment especially during the holidays and all associates respect each other.
good,"While The Company is good to work for, It didnot balance work and life very well. I was a Delivery Driver and it was days when i could work 12 or 13 hours in one day. The management was so so. But overall a decent company to work for. And the compensation was also pretty good."
good,"lowes is a good place to work. it has great people that want to get to know you and there is always something to do. its a big store with thousands of product so there is something new youll learn all the time. over all is a good paying, good benifits, nice people job."
good,"Overall good company to work for, only downfall was there was no room for advancement."
good,"dont reward hard work, allow others to slack off and punish those who work hard"
good,"A typical day at work would be stocking shelves, waiting on numerous customer, working in different departments of the store, using the cherry picker"
good,"On a typical day, I greet and help about 30+ new customers with their purchases either by informing them or providing customer service with loading or unloading. With returning customers I usually greet them by first name and help them quickly at the cash register. I learned how to be time efficient by doing certain things such as doing cart runs, cleaning bathrooms, taking over cashier responsibilities, and help with stocking during certain hours to have the maximum results for my job responsibilities. Therefore, I can finish early and help my team mates with any additional help and finish on time. As far as management goes, I stay in the conversation, and communicate with each and every manager to see what I can do to help the store run smoothly. I think communication is key when working with a team because without it, things cannot be done on time and properly. Communication with co-workers is also very important in the work day because when everyone is effectively communicating and having fun doing it, our jobs are more enjoyable. And as a result, the customers are also happy and everything seems to be in harmony."
good,Every day was a new and interesting day with your friends.
good,Productive home improvement store doing good business and cares about helping its customers receiving ultimate customer service. learned to be compassionate and understanding of customers needs and to guide them to what they need as well as to listen to my customers.
good,"Came into this job just as the sport was moving into the network TV stage. The track was building new grandstands, a new dirt track and trying to rotate out a senior VP of marketing. Made for a very interesting period of time. My job was to sell the new grand stand and then move into sponsorship sales while maintianing a team atmosphere within the existing staff. The dificulty was the transition of the Sr VP giving up the reigns so that the department could move on."
good,"A typical day at work involved greeting customers, giving a hand in keeping lumber dept. in order and generally just helping with customers needs."
good,"Productive workplace long, very longs hours with shift difference. Lowes' is a good place to workj, if you have plenty of time, and like retail."
good,Typical retail full of drama. The customers were usually nice. The job itself I loved but it was the other employees that ultimately made me leave.
good,"Greet customers, Help them out if needed, Keep a clean organized store. Grand Opening ready everyday."
good,"Everyday is something new, some days i will be solving customer issues. Other days i will be doing labor work trying to get my department ready for the next day, I have been a manager for 10 years. I manage employees everyday. Hardest part of my job, would be going in with a game plan, and it changing due to company needs. Working with my co-workers would be the best part."
good,I had no problems working for Lowe's
good,"I worked in lawn and garden so the weather made each day different.I learned alot about plant care and maintenance. The management team changed alot, there were 5 store managers, 5 HR managers and numerous assistants in the time I was there. Lawn and garden used alot of seasonal people so we had to work as a team. Working short handed when the seasonal help were gone was the hardest part of the job. The best part was assisting customers with thier projects."
good,Cool company. Great people. Great workplace. Good benefits
good,"this job was very enjoyable, but a better job was offered. a typical day was slow. i learned that i could do more. i worked alone. the hardest part of this job was the laat hour. the most enjoyable part was working the forklift , pallet jacks and trucks"
good,"This is a typical retail job, although it is specialized toward building and home improvement. Dealing with customers can be interesting. Some customers expect you to know everything about everything in the store (it's a big store!) You will have to stand and walk for long hours on concrete floor. You will get to work in many different departments, (even if you don't know them very well.) Overall, not a bad place to work. I would rather work here than a lot of the other big box stores."
good,Deal with customers on a daily basis. Like my co-workers and some management.
good,"Daily meeting, Learned great customer service skills, management was a joke, Co-workers are friendly,"
good,Pay doesn't reflect difficulty of job. Managers do not communicate to each other at all.
good,Lowes had a nice training program but then they changed it leaving no room for growth.
good,"The area I worked in at Lowes was very fun.I enjoyed the outside garden area very much.Great customers,good people with alot of knowledge in the garden area, as I learned alot from them"
good,"Started early in the morning,pulling orders for customers and load on truck.Deliver product to consumer. Learned how to install appliances"
good,•Run register; input credit card applications into computer.
good,A very good place to work.Made their magerzine for a very productive worker in a short space of time.
good,I enjoyed working for Lowe's for the most part. I learned a lot thanks to my supervisor and a few other coworkers. The pay was well and the hours were great. It had some down falls. But I learn to deal with them and make my day productive.
good,"great place to work, very educational , good benefit package. very busy. need to be a team player and a multi tasker."
good,"I started with outside Lawn and garden, so my day was full of life. Plants, rocks, sand, trees, watering, mulch and pavers."
good,"A typical day at work; working at the Customer Service desk can be very busy. You answer customer questions, handle refunds, answer phone calls, process payments. What I have learned is that it takes a lot of patience when you working at the customer service desk. My co-workers are fun and very knowledgeable."
good,was a good enviroment to work. enjoyed my days about 70 % of the time i was there
good,Excellent working environment with great coworkers who provide ecstatic customer service.
good,A typical day at work is to provide friendly customer service and ensure every customer has every item they need for there home improvement project. I learned how to manage time wisely at this company. My coworkers are very supportive. The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting required.
good,"Each day I assist customers with projects and installs, run machinery, heavy lifting, stressful work environment."
good,Its a normal and sometimes rough day at work but I can handle it. I learned alot working for the company an the co workers are very nice. I manage about 30 cashier so there is no part that is hard. The most important part of my job is makin the customer happy.
good,Not for someone trying to succeed. Great place to start. Great first time job.
good,Juggling customer service and the overall maintenance of my department
good,I worked their for a year as a second job. I advanced very quickly due to my customer service and cashier skills.
good,sitting at the cashier.
good,"The customers and most employees were the best! I looked forward to going to work to see them and work with them. The management was bad. Needed to keep their personal buisness out of the work environment and taking their problems out on the employees. And people that sexually harass fellow employees should not be giving mutilple warnings, they should be fired."
good,"great people, not such a fast paced job they pay isnt so great to start but if you hang in there it will eventually pay off"
good,The most stressful part of the job is 4th Quarter return when tax returns have to be done by January 31st and February 28th. The time period from December to February is very stressful. The most enjoyable part is my job is working with employees and helping them fix their state taxes.
good,"A typical day at work was assisting customers with their needs, whether it is personally or professional. In fact, I became an expert in processing special order sales for our customers. Nevertheless, I enjoyed with a few co-workers at Lowe's. The hardest part of my job at that time was making sure everyone was helped in my department. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new and interesting people day-to-day."
good,"My days were long however I enjoyed my job to the fullest! It could be very exciting when challenges arose. Great group of people to work with. The training programs are not at the level they need to be, especially for management staff. You really have to rely on your ability to ""find"" the information you need and call on others for help if you are lacking experience in an area. Other than that, it is not a bad place to work at all."
good,Just an all around good place to work. Very friendly staff and managers who will answer any questions you may have about your job. Very knowledgable crew.
good,"unload the truck, work four hours sun-mon."
good,good customer service experience. loaded and stocked shelves all day while helping out customers in need. upper management was overall satisfactory.
good,"i ran the lumber and building materials department. it was fun, i love the smell of wood."
good,a full time retail position with the daily tasks of customer service being given everyday
good,"Management was very friendly, and easy to work with. Good associate morale, and decent benefits. Sufficient amount of associates well vast in dealing with customers in all departments."
good,no social committy! or christmas party perhaps no associate cohesivness because of the lack of social events.
good,Management was not overly concerned with customer service just meeting quotas
good,"I learned that there still are companies out there that mean it when they say ""the customer is always right"". Lowe's is an extremely customer oriented company that goes the extra mile to make sure every individual that comes into one of the stores will have a good experience there, and will get exactly what it is they need, and if they cant get what they need at that store, Lowe's will make a point of finding out where they can get it even if that means sending the customer to one of their competitors"
good,"Pretty decent. It's a company trying to redefine itself, and that's difficult because it's so large. There are people who want transform the company, but it's just too complicated to do anything quickly."
good,was a great place lost wieght and just always had a great time. and the pay was great and they treated you great
good,Lowe's is a great place to work with better benifits and pay than most retailers but it is still retail.
good,"I typical day was entailed of working the register, stoking shelves, and cleaning at the end of my shifts."
good,Cream of the crop managers. Everyone given a fair chance. A policy is written for any occurance.
good,A great place for people wanting to work for the summer or get some work experience. good for people new to the work force.
good,It can be a rewarding place to work with being able to help the customers.
good,Great place to work. Helping people help themselves with making a house a home. Training takes place regularly for employee's. Advancement is always open to those who are interested.
good,I have enjoyed my time at Lowes but it is not a place to Start a Career
good,As an assembler and customer service associate work was done primarily managed by myself. Learned skills of working together with a lots of different team members. Retail work can be frustrating at times but Lowe's helps you along with it.
good,I helped customers with purchases. It was fun but do not make enough hours to support my family.
good,I learned alot with my 7 years at Lowes. I really liked the set hours and my coworkers.
good,"A typical work day at Lowes is very interesting.I get to interact with many different customes. I can include my input on projects they are working on in their homes. My co-workers are the best, there is never a dull moment. I enjoy getting to know my customers."
good,"Management wasn't very understanding of sick children and being the military spouse, I am the one who had to be flexible. I provided all doctor's notes requested but still seemed to be looked down upon. The job is hard and dirty, but fun. My co-workers were also great!"
good,Typical always busy
good,"you dont always get your breaks, when I worked there, management was like they had something stressful going on, agitated, long hours, over time"
good,I enjoy my job but the managment and the scheduling of the employees are not up to its expectations.
good,A typical day included helping people build all kinds of home projects. good times.
good,i shouldnt of left. A good place to work. I have nothing else to say.
good,"In addition to routing cashiering and telephone operator, was responsible for assisting customers with special orders and landscape management in the garden center. Also responsible for running kids' workshop, receiving commendation for expanding and improving it."
good,I really like this job it was fast pace good benifits friendly people
good,Lowe's home improvement has been a good stable job but with minimal ability to move forward with a real career. Their scheduling system is atrocious with many close then open shifts and has a negative effect on balancing life and work. As for the last year they have been going through allot of changes that have made it hard for long time employees to justify staying with them any longer. A good starter job but no career for someone looking for a long term employment solution.
good,The people are nice and you learn a lot but the advancement is lower scale and rarely happens to employees who haven't been with the company at least 6 months.
good,"Run the front end and assist customer's. Co-worker's are fantastic, management changes their mind's every other day and the working atmosphere is less than desireable."
good,My job was to stock Lowes for its store opening. I enjoyed learning store secrets but didnt enjoy male counterparts attempting to flirt with me.
good,"As far as retail goes Lowe's is a great place to work. The hours are the worst part of the job, but getting to work everyday helping people to complete their projects is great."
good,"A typical day at work for me is stocking shelves, ordering product for department, cycle counting product to ensure correct on hand quantities, overseeing training and certifications for associates in my department. Creating opportunities within my department that will increase sales and meet budget. The hardest part of the job is lifting the heavy boxes which can be repetitive and sometimes causes back strain. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers especially the customers who frequent the store and very nice.For the most part my co-workers are good people. Most are willing to help out when needed. My management are pretty good guys there are some areas they can work on when it comes to relating to the employees and being respectful towards them at times but for the most part they take their jobs seriously and try to help the store best as possible."
good,It was a nice cool place to work the management and employees were nice people and easy to get along with.The job itself was easy.
good,I cant say anything bad about lowes. I love that job! one thing is the hours got cut..
good,"Unload Product, stock shelves, clean shelves and floor. Learn about new products and the importance of customer/worker relationships. Managers and co-workers are nice and easy to work with. Hardest part of the job is fitting 16' lumber down the isles. Most enjoyable is the satisfactory of making your department look good."
good,"Hours all over the place, rarely a chance to advance, and HR has a tendency to ignore your availability."
good,great benifits good management will work around scool and family
good,i would load and unload plants and trees reload the shelves wit the forklift did what ever i was told to do swept if dirty power washed the ground organized the plants and trees help load peoples merchandise.the managers there really didnt care about you.Loved most of the coworkers. there really wasnt a hard part to me besides watering the plants.Most important part of my job is or was is helping others.
good,Good Company. Managing 30+ cashiers daily. I have learned patience dealing with the general public. Do not have the ability to move up in the company as fast as I would have liked.
good,It is okay for an entry level job to gain experience and confidence but it is not so great if you are looking for advancement opportunities. Internal job opportunities are very competitive. Pay is not so great especially if you have a degree.
good,"A typical day at my current job at Lowes entails a lot of customer focused duties. I am a sales associate mainly resposible to help customers in meeting their home improvement needs, espeacially pertaining to my department of electrical and lighting. I also manage speacial orders, inventory, and the overall appearance of my department. Each day is different, however, as I may be needed to help out in other departments through out the store. I am also directly under my department manager and am resposible to take over his managerial duties when he is absent or away from the store."
good,Lowes wasn't a bad company to work for but to me it was hard to keep up with them on their polocies they changed way to often. The employees where easy to get along with.
good,"Walking into work at Lowe's 5:30 in the A.M. My seeing my co-workers smiling early in the morning. Working at Lowe's is fun. The customers are great. Iam a customer service associate that means I am all around customers. You see, hear, and learn about a customer. And I have learn my lesson well. A customer came to the desk ready to check out her items.I greeted her saying...Hello how are you feeling today? Did you find evertything o.k. The customer replied... Don't play with me I'll come over that counter! I said Excuse me. She said it again. I just called my supervisor. And she took over. I was in shock. My supervisor said I handled that well."
good,"Days were fast, always answering questions and helping customers."
good,Very Busy Work area!! Well although it was a very short seasonal position it was fun while it lasted had loads of fun etc
good,Typical work day includes assisting customers in scheduling service for customers on defective products. I enjoy sharing time with co-workers about each others days.
good,Productive place of employment based and focused on customer service. People are a challenge and Lowe's has been a challenging experience and fun.
good,Working at Lowe's was a short term place for me. I graduated from college and needed a job and could not find one so I ended up taking a job there. Working at Lowe's was pretty easy. I went in and went to my work station (Millwork) and found my checklist for the day. I completed whatever tasks were mine and helped assist customers. I learned mainly about helping customers and dealing with people who aren't always friendly and in the best of moods. The managers there was average. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers and the most enjoyable was having the opportunity to work with several others in a team environment.
good,customer focus company. good place if full time. comes with benefits
good,Things were terrible but you could see people were unhappy and didnt wanna come to work.
good,i dont think this job is going anywhere its here to stay.the customers are great and nice. I enjoyed this job alot and learned good customer service.
good,This was a good job to work if you are attending college or want to have a lot off time off
good,"What started as a good job with a good work atmosphere slowly turned sour. Learning all i could, i was constantly looked over for advancement, and after years of experience my compensation was paling into comparison of newer workers."
good,"Seemed like it was going to be a good place to pick my working goals back up again, but I was mistaken. Found out that the saying ""once a cashier, always a cashier"", was thrown around way too much, although it was true. Management treated everyone just as employees, not as actual human beings. Wish I could have had a better experience."
good,Typical days ranged from assisting customer with complaints to training associates on store procedures all while monituring and maintain store processes and proceedures. The hardest part of the job was the work home life balance. I avaerage 70 hour weeks. The satisfying part was completing my administartive tasks and resloving difficult situations.
good,Great benefits and great company but as a salaried manager I worked to many hours
good,A very busy place to work. A place of fast growth in many different departments and opportunity. Pay rate there is pretty nice...
good,"mostly stayed busy, most people were nice and easy to get along with. Management was alright. the hardest part was not knowing the product knowleage, the people was most enjoyable"
good,not much room for advancement here.......learned time management.....leadership......
good,Typical retail environment. Deal with customers all day and keep store looking decent.
good,From what I can remember it was a fairly good place to work. The people there were nice and management was good.
good,I have just started with this company as a weekend team menber and have only been there for 3 weeks. So far it has been a pleasant place to work
good,"Lots of good people. Challenging. Always something to do or be worked on. 40 Hrs a week are the max here, though."
good,large customer service based company. good management team.. constant changing of hours causes burning out at the job.
good,"Very change oriented, they prefer employee's to have a well rounded set of skills within the retail arena and therefore move people about within the company frequently. My personal responsibilities were to oversee design and product development staff in the completion of private label products and occasionally to work with established brands (vendors) in providing design direction geared to their perceived customer segmentation."
good,-Really enjoyed training new employees
good,Early or Late hours
good,Help customers with their projects from start to finish. Get to talk and meet lots of intresting people. Managers always try to help out when possible. Co workers are always willing to give a helping hand.
good,"When I opened I would count the till, make coffee, make tea, put out the condiments and meats in the food preper, and stock the glass, closeing was the same in revers."
good,"This job I would usually set up buy using a fork truck to retrieve pallets, match order sheet to truck, and position rollers to unload truck. I didnt really learn anything new that I've already learned at previous jobs. I did like the job because management and co-workers where both friendly."
good,We would down sock products from the over head bin. Help customers with any and all issues. Great atmosphere to work in with great management. The hardest part of the job was trying to help everyone. Sometimes there would be so many customers we couldn't always get to them all. The most enjoyable part is helping a customer solve a problem.
good,Lowes is a good place to work however you will get the feeling nothing you do will ever be good enought.
good,"Shifts vary, with no set schedule, so there is no such thing as a typical day. Each day brings different tasks and challenges. I've learned many skills while here; from driving a forklift, to rekeying locks. Most coworkers are pleasant to work with and or for. Dealing with the seldom irrate customer is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable thing for me is driving the power equipment, as I have always been fascinated by heavy machinery."
good,At the time i was working at Lowes it was diffcult to talk to the HR at the time now they got rid of her and I've talk to the store manger about her and about the HR at the time but it seem that if you wasn't manger or and a high position your word didn't mean much to the company
good,"Everyday at Lowe's is new and challenging you are always learning something new, but although I have enjoyed my time here I am looking for a more stable career."
good,i enjoyed the hours i worked and the people i worked with. it was always something different each day and a new challenge.
good,I liked this job and it I think I what have fit in well. It was just a seasonal position so no future.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's is selling merchandise to the customers and assisting customers in meeting their needs. Also, making sure that the products are always stocked and full. I learned how to be confident in applying my selling skills. Management was always willing to help out and improve employee skills. The co-workers worked together to make sure our daily duties were always done and complete."
good,"Very busy, I learned alot in Big Flats, Management was great, co-workers great."
good,No one wanted to properly explain how to do anything. I had to ask multiple people to be able to know how to place a pick up later or a deivery.
good,I loved my job more than anything in my life. The employees are like a family running a business. I will miss a lot about working for them and the great co-workers. Management needs to be more aware of things going on in the place. I loved helping customers and never would refuse to help a customer like they say I did. I could never wait to go back each day.
good,"I set this store up as well as walmart, sams club ,and a toysrus.Did the hiring for these stores as well."
good,Lowe's used to be a fun place to work but down the line it lost a little bit of value and morals along the way.But I enjoy meeting different people that really make my day.I enjoy meeting different races of people .Also I
good,Lowe's commercial/construction sales in one of the best in the construction sale industry.
good,"Fun place to work, always staying busy,always have to be on top of customer service and there expectations."
good,Benefits are good but are often undertaffed. Wish they would have same shifts. Vacation time is good but you work most holidays and late at night.
good,"They are the best paying retail company I ever worked for, and they care about thier employees"
good,Enjoyed the job but not so much some of the other team members and management and supervisorsthat did not take an interest in what was done and how they were doing it
good,"Lowe's is a very good company to work for at an associate level. Once you become management, they own you. Lowe's is like every other large retail store that will use and abuse the hardest workers."
good,Company is on the right track to take business to the next level.
good,"Average retail work environment, but with decent pay and benefits."
good,I like working at Lowes I however don't like the scheduling It would be better to have 3 straight shifts instead of all over the board such as one day 6:30am to 3:30 and the next 12-9 and 10-7 inconsistent makes hard to plan any appointments.
good,I started with Lowe's in March of 2008 and currently keep my 20+ hours a week there because of benefits and guaranteed hours. There is a huge amount of stress related to my position there and little in the way of appreciation in either financial compensation or general support shown from the levels of management above me.
good,I found that this is not a place that you will able to stay for long
good,"The management tree at this company is poorly laid out, the department managers need more authority or they might as well not have the title ""manager""."
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes. The only down side is that is a training store for managers. You would get a store manager in there that was just in it for him or herself. No caring about assoicates. Looking out for themselves only. But I did work with some wonderful people whom respected you and praised you for a job well done.
good,"What I enjoyed about this job with the customer service and family friendly environment. As a part time job, I also appreciated the flexibility that this job offered."
good,Great place to work but the moral is at a all time low as you get no support from management..Store manager cares more about numbers than the  employees.Corpoate does the schedule so it fluctuates weekly..
good,Typical day at work was conducting safety inspections and cycle counts of product. There was a great culture in the store of team work and friendliness. Lowes cared for their customers and always made it a comfortable place to shop.
good,The work experience was do-able and other staff members were helpful with tasks. Everyone kinda does their own thing and usually have their work spots.
good,"No two days are alike and there is always problems to solve, there is very little follow through on day to day issues. More often than not employees are just there to collect a paycheck and are not willing to do anymore than they have too."
good,"Company is heading in a great direction.  Changes can be painful at times.  A lot of hard work, but very satisfying when you get to help both customers and associates."
good,"The one thing about this position that is rewarding would be the opportunity to learn new positions, new products, new challenges.  The hardest part of the position is that corporate makes changes and are not hands on to see the effects."
good,For a long time management kept holding fulltime over my head saying show use your work ethic and we will consider it. over a year assed of me running the department by myself. me one guy doing the work that should be split between myself and the other lumber associates.
good,"Cleaning Appliances, Going over the benefits with Costumers< I learned to balance the morning inventory with sales. The culture was steady, friendly and professional , The hardest part of the job was loading fridges onto trucks. The most enjoyable was seeing my coworkers daily."
good,My typical day would to ensure customers left the store satisfied. Checking them out at the register and bagging their groceries in a fast timely manner. Job for me was not difficult at all. I enjoyed seeing customers leave happy and building relationships with them. To me that Is important.
good,I enjoy working at Lowe's. Just like any job there will always be those people that make work less fun.  But overall I would recommend working here without a doubt
good,"Unfriendly, micromanaging, managers with big heads are not going to make for a good experience.  Sometimes taking care of a customer issue correctly depends on which manager you seek out.  If you decide to work as a department associate know that you Will have to use ladders and other equipment to get items from top stock and somethings are HEAVEY."
good,Typical day can be hectic. Your plan for the day can be changed at the drop of a hat. Long term the company will set you up to retire comfortably. Down side is some politics in advancement.
good,for the most part associates will assist eachother but there are those that wont pull their own weight. Which requires you to step up. yes even some managers
good,"At first it was a great job to start working at until the new CEO came in, then that's when it started going down hill for employees. It got to the point I was managing 5 departments at the same time because they wouldn't schedule anyone on the night shift."
good,"dont expect much, they only care about making money and on occasion  about the people, managers try but hands are tied most of the time. associates are great though"
good,things change often including scheduling and rules making work and family balance difficult. recently jobs have been getting eliminated or out sources to a third party.
good,Lowe’s is a decent place its really cluttered all the time. Your expected to do a lot compared to what your paid they often want you to do other departments work because they have cut hours. Overall it’s pretty stressful and management is key to your happiness aka terrible managers terrible time.
good,"The company is a great place to work if you love the retail experience of it. The management needs a little help, along with the front end. Overall it is a pretty okay place to work."
good,"My store was not a very well run establishment.   By the time  was fired, they were trying to fire people for strange things.  Within the past two years they fired many associates for unusual reasons.  In 2019, the store I worked at went through 3 store managers where one was fired and the second one quit.   I was one of those who were fired for bizarre reasons"
good,The MST team makes it a very fun environment to work in. The hardest part of the job is when setting planogram is looking around the whole store in top stock to find it.
good,"Lowe's was a great place to start my management career.  They offered many training programs, and were willing to coach and train anyone who showed promise or interest."
good,Part time poor management but liked the training but after that you sink or swim.  Never expect to leave on time if working late the store is a mess.  They don’t properly return check items.  Once the clerks accepted a box of rocks
good,"I really enjoy the atmosphere, if they offered more money I would stay in a heart beat."
good,"Handled customers in a variety of departments such as electrical, paint, hardware, flooring, plumbing along with outdoor lawn and garden care. Job requires a good variety of knowledge."
good,"I spent 14 years there.  I rarely got raises.  The environment was acceptable and sometimes very nice.   They DO go out of their way to work with your schedule and the benefits are pretty good, even for Part-timers and students.  What I enjoyed most, was my co-workers and regular customers.  It’s OK."
good,"There are too many individuals that abuse unconscious bias in the workplace. Some individuals are doing more than what they are responsible, while there are individuals in positions with entitlement that may not do enough."
good,They feel that they can change the rules daily on things they also feel that they can change your schedule with out telling you and no 24 48 he notice they ask you to do things for free for customers in the department I work in which is the delivery dept
good,"Lowes is a good company, depending on your manager. I thought my managers had my best interests, but when I got hurt on the job, they totally dropped the ball. But other than that I like working there."
good,You never know what's going to change next at Lowes. With new leadership we never know what they will take away from us. Basic employees lost all set schedules. Then got new attendance policies. Then mass layoffs. You never know what change will be next.
good,"Lowe's is changing.   At some point,  it will closely resemble home depot.   It used to feel like a family.   Now it feels like a vehicle to make money for activist investors."
good,I was surprised how laid back the dress code is.  I often see associates with earbuds in their ears.  Seems like a family environment.  Management could be a little better.
good,It was a very different ball game ... great supervisor . I mean o just kind of drifted away from the interest maybe if I had a different position. Still overall a great place to be.
good,"Great place to work, good benefits. Room for advancement, you just have to be in the right circle. They support you furthering your education and even offer scholarships. Management schedule is a 4wk. rotation.. one weekend off a Month plus a Sunday/Friday. The other two weeks are weekdays you have off."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's until they abandoned the phone operator position; stopped staffing the customer service department with CSAs; downgraded my CSA position back to cashier (w/o even bothering to notify me -- I didn't hire on to be a cashier); screwed with both the rotating schedule and the attendance policy; outsourced certain jobs/services and provided only 1-day notice to affected associates that they no longer had a job -- and they would have to apply for any other available openings within a given time frame, etc. I'm not going to spend a great deal of time further elaborating on all the bravo sierra I saw that was wrong there in my opinion. Another big problem with Lowe's is that management in general seems to have become way less responsive to calls for their assistance -- to say the least. And also, suffice it to say that I'm not at all a fan of the new CEO who doesn't seem to be a fan of the often much over-worked frontline associates. The order of the day at Lowe's these days seems to be to just pile on wherever possible and whoever IS there will just have to mount up and carry the additional load."
good,"Lowe's is fair some what, corporate got rid of my positions as a FAS - Facility Service Assistant and also Assembler and hired a Third Party witch left me out of a job on July 31st, 2019,"
good,"I've worked at 3 Lowes. Two of them were great. One of them was horrible. It all depends on the store. The pay is good. It's rare that you get a set schedule."
good,"Help you little with things that needed to be done quickly"
good,It was a fast paced place. I learned the usual things you'd learn in a warehouse environment. Hardest part of the job was lifting the heavier things. Most enjoyable part of the job was the schedule.
good,Learning the base customer service skills I needed when starting out this was the best place. The customers were what made this job its greatest. I welcomes being able to help all the customers as they needed it.
good,"Good place to work, benefits are ok, work schedule is good, supervisors are supportive. Work is physically demanding but not overly so. 4 day work weeks are nice. Work can get tedious"
good,"Sales, sales, sales. Work life balance is very hard with shifts as early as 5 am to 11 pm."
good,It was my Team and I we all made Store#1508 the most engaged store in the company district and market. The constant training keep HRM's connected to each other and update policies and procedures. State and local laws
good,"Lowe's is an okay part-time job. I would recommend it to student's in high school, university and college as it mostly gets busy in the summer and less during the winter and fall time which gives students more time to focus on their school work. Management varies and scheduling isn't the best."
good,"Lowes does offer opportunities for individuals that are willing to demonstrate leadership and the willingness to advance. It doesn't come overnight but, through consistancy and dedication theres no limit to the opportunities that awaits."
good,"I was hired on a Lowe's as a seasonal assembler.  The people I worked with were very helpful and I learned quite a bit from them.  It was a fun work experience in the little time I had there.  However even though I was hired on temporarily, Lowes had decided to lay off all of their assemblers and porters nationwide permanently, in lieu of a 3rd party."
good,I was at Lowe’s for approximately 1 1/2 years and I received 1 raise of $0.14. That to me was beyond unacceptable. That was disrespectful. Wasn’t a bad place to work with the exception of salary.
good,"crazy schedule. good people. not much training. typical day was helping customers, stocking shelves.  If you have strong associates in your department makes things much easier."
good,"We and the receiving crew were almost always short handed, and sometimes we would get two trucks with almost 2,000 items on board. We would plead for help and we would almost never get it. The managers would still be cracking the whip on us even though some days we would be down two people.. Two out of four people being gone means productivity plummets, If they wanted it done on time we should have been provided assistance and instead, us two people got called lazy by one manager and another one (the Night Crew Manager) came in early and began throwing things at us. If you don't appreciate BS like this, I highly recommend against working here."
good,At lowes I liked it there at first when I first started but then we god new managers and it became so demanding like they got rid of the janitors and it was up to the cashiers to do all of the cleaning and we had to sweep outside. The managers are mean and nasty and they have a bad attitude.
good,"Lowes is like any high volume retail company. Upper Management changes often, so you experience excellent to very poor managers. As a manager, I had very little opportunity to invest and develop my people.  Putting out “fires” consumes a majority of your time. Retail pay in general is terrible. You will do more for less than most jobs. If you love helping people and consider yourself people person, you will survive a max of 3-4 years and then you will begin to hate people. There are some incredibly rude and slobbering stupid people in this world and you will meet them ALL! "
good,Currently too many changes at one time. Jobs being eliminated and scheduling changing. Work/Life balance that made this job tolerable is being eliminated.
good,It is a ok job to work . No benifts. Part-time work. No overtime. Managers do t listen. I would recommend this job to anyone. Poor customer service. Hard to get ahold of in case of an emergency.
good,I had a pretty good overall experience with this company.The store manager was awesome you could go to him for anything. It had a family feel to the whole store.
good,Nice place to work is to get along with peoples. Really most of the task you do are just to better the experience for the customer. But really easy work most of the time.
good,"Great benefits and good starting pay with flexible scheduling. However, management does not coordinate instruction well with each other or its employees."
good,"Good workplace culture, premium pay for Night shift or Weekend shift."
good,"I enjoyed meeting the several customers that came through, and especially the regular custormers that you may see on a daily time.  They have room for advance and there were several people that were career emplyees."
good,"Great experience like my co worker, and some of managers. Very flexible work place. High turnover rate there. Job security is questionable for many people."
good,"Lowes will offer advancement if you show interest, I find the management sets the work atmosphere, If you have one that cares and is fair then thats the atmosphere you get.  The pay is higher than most retail but there is alot required of you also."
good,I was very happy to go from one store to the next and was told I was the best at what I did to keep everyone happy.Then this new team of management has came in and is all by the book with no time on floor with the real workers that keep lowes customers coming back.If we have been in our depts for years with no wright ups or drama then let us do what we do.Some of us are little fish and are just fine that way.You are nothing with out us.I work in a right to work state.If I did not I would strike. Just remember The way same treated his workers and look at them now.
good,Good environment to work in. Customers at times would be the only stressful part of the job. Other than that the staff is okay and the work is too. Not too demanding.
good,It is a great place to work if you can keep the politics out of the workday. Stay positive and do your work and the management will be your best friend. If you do not stay on top of your work assignments you may get into trouble with your department supervisor.
good,"Was a laid back, relaxed environment. Good hours in commercial sale. But they had me helping out delivery most days. So got a little over time, or gave me option to leave early on Friday."
good,This place is a nice place n they make sure you safe there they make you feel like you are a part off the familly thats so nice of them anyway they doing a good job
good,"Mostly great coworkers, floor/department managers generally very good, store top management OR corporate management oblivious to actual floor needs that put undue stress to the good employees who care about the store, the business and the customers. Pay is on the low end and some floor managers will go to bat to get better pay for worthy employees. I, a lowly associate, actually, turned out, was yielding a big stick of awareness, with management to help push good hard workers with positive attitude to management and specialist positions (since I wasn't interested due to my work-vacation needs as a part time wealthy retiree). I felt very respected by co-workers and managers. VERY. However, I think, because of corporate management direction some worthy employees are stressed and unhappy. The lazy ones filter themselves out of the company."
good,"Started out working 25 hours a week and then cut me to less than 10 hours a week, couldn’t afford to work that little"
good,It was a very on pace job. A lot of the time we didn’t have bag and we’d have to deal with customers about them. They would switch my schedule sometimes without me knowing. The hours were good and so was the pay and the majority of the people working there are nice.
good,working at lowes was a decent job to have. Nothing was too crazy to do or too terribly hard. management was terrible as far as fairness of giving out days off having to ask almost 3 weeks in advance.
good,"While employed with Lowe's, I currently oversee employees to make sure that all processing of merchandise is compliant. I interaction with customers and solving many issues right on the spot. Challenges are presented everyday. This position pushes you to allows do your best."
good,Job was good but if you are older there is very little chance to advance. A bit favorites oriented. Variety of people with little team work. No more to say. No
good,"Very faced paced environment especially in the higher volume stores. Customer centric culture, can be both rewarding and frustrating at same time due to customer demands."
good,a day started watering and looking after all flowers plants and shurbs. helped customers find what they needed. I learned how to care for all plants. I learned to be a cashier worked inside seasonal and  hardware and return desk. the management was not the greatest. worked with many different people. hardest part of my job was the heat. my favorite part of my job was being outside every day and looking after the plants and watching customers smile cuz they were happy with your advice and help
good,"Every day casual dress, very nice corporate campus with coffee shop and food options. Continual department reorganizations underway. More work than anyone can reasonably do in 40 hours."
good,"Compensation was fitting for the job. Wages were non-negotiable, take it or leave it upon interview. Fairly easy to move around and advance within the company and even across different stores."
good,"I worked on the MST team as a full time employee. My manager was wonderful and the team was great but the hours were awful! Start time of 5am really sucked!! This job was pretty much a housekeeping job for Lowe’s. You log into a bay, check the POG and clean the bay to make it opening day ready. You fill out these service sheets about what you did in the bay. The higher up managers micro manage and check your work behind you."
good,"To have an accident prevented at work, please listen to the employee on how they feel. Because if they say they still hurt, it's for a good reason! Please listen!"
good,"I've been with Lowe's about 18 months. I originally worked for them in NC as a seasonal floor person, then transferred to AL as a Cabinet Specialist. I arrived in Alabama roughly the same time our new CEO took office. "
good,"I feel I am overwhelmed by the task I am given by my managers underpaid for my work, looked over for promotion, but my job is good and it pays the bills."
good,"Get in at eight forty shift starts at nine. Start my zoning and putting out everything that can go out by hand until store closes. Store closes start putting out lumber by forklift and dropping pallets from top stock to fill in holes. after lumber in stocked I go to the plywood sheet rock aisle stock it out make sure its evened out and flat stacked. Next insulation filled and even nothing hanging in aisle. Lunch is at 1:30 until thirty or two depending on if you want the full hour or thirty. At the end of the shift I go to each aisle sweeping, I clean as I go. "
good,"The job is a good opportunity, but the work/life balance is way off. The direction the company is heading in is not so good right now. Managers are really only concerned with profits even at the expense of the customers and the staff."
good,The pay is decent and benefits are quite good but with the constant management changes and policy changes it's a completely different environment from how it was when I started
good,It's fine. It has up and down. It's culture changes based on seasons. But most of the time it is a calm place to work. You get plenty of time outside.
good,Company is a good place to work with great people but turn over is high as people are fed up with poor management and constantly changing protocols and procedures. CEO is changing a lot since he is still in the first couple years of his take over.
good,Never know what your doing from day to day till you get to work. They won’t give you any more than 40 hours. Depending on your job title they can move you around.
good,I enjoyed my time at Lowes. while working there I met people who I enjoy being around. I also got to learn a few different departments in the store that was interesting.
good,"Pros:"
good,Not enough pay for the maximum work job is real well with working around your schedule. Good benefits and health insurance and good job security lovely working environment
good,"Benefits are provided if you can afford them with their pay.  ASM's and store manager are friendly but show a lack of care for employees.   All supervisors were great to work with and showed great care for their department team members.  They operate on a shifting corporate schedule, which is extremely inconvenient, for ""fairness.""  Very reluctant to give meaningful raises."
good,Lack of communication with managers as a employee throughout the store. Poor pay for this job. Wouldn't recommend unless you had another part time job.
good,"If you show promise, the managers will make you the go to person and will just forget everyone else exist and only critique your work and relies on you to fix everyone's problems. Has very little room for advancement, you can be a star and every manager loves you but the second a Home Depot employee applies it is like well you see they are just better so we offered the position to them. At my current store, we have had 10+ positions open with multiple people in-house applying but we have only seen external ex-home depot people get hired. We even hired an ex-depot employee that was fired for STEALING."
good,"It will pay your bills. good benefits. The job will keep you busy with stuff to do. You would rarely have slow day, you would only have when the weather is bad outside."
good,"Lowes can be a great company to work for, but in order for that to happen management needs to learn to collaborate with one another and observe their employees stronger,  weaker traits and place them in a role that fits their dominating trait. "
good,"…..Seasonal worker that might survive,.management good.....close to home....pay poor.... a lot of instruction, on work time....might work out, don't know how much pay will improve,"
good,"The job was cool , I worked  Night Shift and as a Stocker, that's all  did at night. It's a major big company  so it was a lot of items. It was productive and always busy"
good,Pay was terrible.  I want able to get over 5 hours a day. Wasn't able to live of that. Didnt feel o was making enough there. Management never communicated with each there
good,The job was easy I knew what to do but the job is very strict on safety and it was almost like you couldn’t get anything done working there. So I work
good,"Scheduling Issues, equipment issues, good management structure, advancement opportunities, good pay, associates take a lot of beating from customers with no understanding from managemenf"
good,"When I first started out at Lowes, it seemed like a very good work environment, with good pay, good hours, and room for growth. After being there a couple of months, I went from getting 30 hrs a week to 15. They consistently hire and cut the hours of the people who have been working there. There's not a lot of training given and it is hard to get more hours if needed. It's an ok first job but I would not recommend it to anyone who is in need of a full time job."
good,its a good place has good management and the staff is good to and there are things that makes working there easier and the only thing i don like is the back to back where you do all cling shifts or if you do a closing they have you doing an opening shift  the next day
good,Good place to work liked talking to customers. Family oriented.love for pets to be brought in by customer. Only problem had to work in cold and to much heat
good,"The work environment is good, especially with other employee's and Customers. This is a good place to work at if you want to know more about home improvement and need a place for hours."
good,"nice place to work except for store manager who is very unprofessional towards his employees. they will train you on computer how to  work in store   safety,spills talk to customers etc, but no manager trains you on your computer in  your  department  (plumbing) on installs and special orders. 4 months there and i would call manager to help on computer but still  no training, the guys in my department once in awhile would try and teach me but so busy on floor really never got enough computer training and most of time i was the only employee in my department, its hard to train yourself on the computer when your the only one working."
good,"Great place to work for but after the new CEO took over about 1.5 years ago there's been a lot of changes, both good and bad. Took a big hit as far as them cutting our team from a 5 man team to a 3 man team for 7-12 months and doubling our work load. There was also a lack of communication between some of the management whenever any issues would arise. Quarterly bonuses if the store met profits. If the store is accident free for x amount of days the store buys lunch/ice cream for employees."
good,i enjoyed doing cashier and i would do it somewhere. i liked how they had 1 hour long breaks. Not having a set schedule got irritating.i wanted more hours but at the time it was slow.
good,"I was looking for summer work that would require me to be more active. I worked in the lumber department, got along with my coworkers, and the customers were usually nice."
good,"At first it was great working there. The pace was good, but overtime, I started to get name called. Rumors spread about me that were not true. No good"
good,"When I was hired at Lowe's I was hired for Mon-Thurs 4am-9am.We keep our (almost) 5 yr old great-granddaughter 2 days a week. She always asks for me. I thought these hours could be very good. The only problem being is if she starts kindergarten this fall, my wife doesn't drive anymore and we'd have to find some way to get her to school. He Mama does not want her on the bus ;<( Our hours have been changed to where, for a long while I'd have to be there by 3am and my wife would know I was home when I drove in the driveway. Now, it's 3am until 7am. Getting up at 2am is no picnic. I do not rest well at all. The 10% discount is WONDERFUL as is most of the benefits offered. But apparently part-time is only allowed to miss 8 days in (I guess a year). I missed 5 days, had a doctor's statement and they've threatened firing me. I cannot get FMLA because I've not been at Lowe's 1 year and worked 1250 hours. But I can get Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), in fact they called me! ADA will make Lowe's take their write-up off me and strike the days I missed with a doctor's statement. Things seem to have gone from good to worse there much like many other places of work. A lot of it also depend's on you supervisor."
good,I worked in the lumber department so I would help customers get there orders for there lumber and help get it to their vehicle. I would also use machinery to stock and move lumber through out the store. I would also use the store saw to cut wood for customers.
good,"Working at lowes is tiring especially if your working in the garden center, managers expect alot from you and mine dont really help out, I dont feel like I'm getting paid enough do to multiple objectives throughout the day. Have to deal with customers, work power equipment, have a daily to do list...etc"
good,"Job didn't provide a lot of training, you had to teach yourself most of the things that needs to be learned. Job needs to be more fluent with the managers they hire."
good,"Your lowes workplace can either be excellent or not quite, depending on the management. However, as a productive employee, you can step up and do your best in your role to make it work and even thrive in the company's name. Regardless of location, lowes provides great opportunity to grow and learn."
good,The customers I encountered was probably the most stressful part of the job. Management felt inconsistent at times and it made working there a bit harder than expected.
good,It was a good way to pay for college and still have a life to be involved on campus. Started in outside lawn and garden and move up to delivery. Bosses were helpful but sometimes picked sides for upper management to be happy.
good,Its a good place to work. Good perks and benefits. Sometimes mandatory overtime but it's okay. Family oriented environment. Some opportunities for advancement.
good,"The managers at my location was messy and lacked a lot at leadership. Showed favoritism to certain employees. They cut hours, which made workers quit."
good,Enjoyed working with Customers and helping them find what they needed to help improve their lives. Lack of staffing for front end made for extra hours and lack of breaks
good,Management is very responsive but requires you to work long hours and stay late.  They both encourage you and expect you to work hard long hours.  and frown when you don't.  computer system is old and antiquated.  processes are complex and arduous... extremely difficult to learn.
good,At times its can be hard during a rush of customers with no extra help at times. But at can be helpful to keep busy time goes by fast and also good to have calm customers that are patient to wait for your help.
good,"average management"
good,some days had gone smoother than others. there are some problems in any working environment. sometimes it was very stressful work environment due to its fast pace. but overall it was it good experience.
good,"Management does their best, but most the store is very short on staff. A lot of associates don't really care about the workplace or their job, theyre only there to get paid."
good,"Lowes is a good company for which to work however, the PSI program was a huge loss on the company.  It took on average 30 days to get a simple proposal to customer. It was a good management decision to eliminate the program. Good job CEO"
good,"not a bad job if properly staffed, and pay was better. if i was fresh out of high school or needed a second job would not be bad as with most retail jobs some managers a great some not so much"
good,"The job at Lowes as a Sales Associate was an easy straight forward job, but the management was really bad with scheduling therefore made it impossible to work most of the time."
good,Good place to work. The business has become more customer centric with the new CEO. Moved to simple approach with 3 big objectives. I call it going back to basics.
good,"Lowe's is overall a great place to work but not without sacrafice to your work/life balance. "
good,"Lowe's as a company is a good place, however at my specific store there were many managers who were focused on results, but at the cost of morale. They often would speak negatively to their employees in disrespectful tones and it really did cross the line very often. However there were some others who I never experienced this with, and I only ever worked at one store"
good,"Overall Lowe's is an amazing place to work, but the scheduling is terrible and doesn't allow for a good work life balance. You must be dedicated to a retail lifestyle to work in this company."
good,"The company is in the midst of a lot of change to contract the business and optimize the core U.S. business. This will have a lot of consequences on organizational structure changes, personnel allocation, and place wage pressures or compensation shortcomings due to poor financial performance in recent years."
good,Good job for someone coming out of high school. The pay isnt bad and the hurs can be flexable. just watch how many times you call out of work. but overall Lowes is a pretty good start.
good,"Workplace is fast paced and lively, must be a people person to be able to successfully work on the sales floor. Flexible schedules to work with any lifestyle."
good,"They did offer fun lunches/themes, Team Building etc. "
good,"Operating on a 28 day rotational schedule for 95% of employees makes home life tough. The benifits are good. The pay is low. You work on a concrete floor all day. Managment has more and more duties over the years affecting the ability to take care of their employees. The training is good, however training needs to be paired more effectively with a mentor working in the position you are training for."
good,I liked working for his company. They had good cord management good employees good staff. They always cared about the customer customer always came first. I just feel that I need to handle themselves a little bit better with promotions within
good,Great pay however comes with a rotating schedule leaving very little time off with family. Great benefits. Strong company heading in a more innovative direction
good,"Great work-life balance."
good,"I've worked with Lowe's for going on 9 years. I loved it the first few years here. It's overall not a bad place to work considering that it is after all a retail job. "
good,The work is not that bad as long as you can keep yourself busy. Quite often you are just restocking shelves or trying to help customers find different objects in the store because others did not help them.
good,"The management I worked with were good.  The work ethics of the employees, too often, were poor.  Lazy, back-bitters and gossipers, unkind.  Too much laziness and not enough concern for the upkeep of the workplace creating a pleasant shopping environment for shoppers.  Sad."
good,Retail can be stressful & this is no exception.  The pay is better than many retail jobs & the turn over is so high that if you stay with the company you will get promoted within.
good,"Throughout my work experience with Lowe's the staff, management, and contractors were incredibly friendly. The main problem I encountered though as the work scheduling, not the hours, the pay, or the work. Without any forewarning your scheduled workdays will change and if you do not check online everyday you wont know your work schedule."
good,"When we have freight we are very busy , especially in the spring and summer months. You get a break and paid lunch , they have some benefits for part time employees."
good,"I was able to move up quickly  from a part time floor associate to Kitchen and Bath design un under a year. "
good,"Enjoyed working for a while, until the manager who hired me left and a new manager came who didn't know how to relate to older workers. The new manager got rid of the good store managers and they were replaced with young inexperienced ones who had to learn on the job."
good,Delivery driving for Lowes was both fast paced as well as a relaxed environment.  the management seemed to genuinely care about the associates.  Delivering and installing appliances in customers home was rewarding and allowed us to provide great in home customer service.
good,Great company but I feel they are going in the wrong direction. I have a family and I have committed almost 15 years to this company but I have no where to go. They need help.
good,Its ok sometimes. Co workers are chill easy to get along with and work with. They dont always hire the best people for management. They tend to let go of the better workers rather than the ones that slack at their jobs.
good,"Generally a fast paced work environment. With a good team in place, the atmosphere is very enjoyable. Training is provided, and encouraged. Safety is a top priority with employees, products, and inventory."
good,I was compensated well for the work I did. The new CEO brings a lot of hope and fears of change. There are always great people to work with. Time will tell if the changes will turn the company around.
good,Some management was great while others lacked the control needed for the job. Was asked to do many things outside my area due to favoritism among other things and an overall lack of caring for their employees. Other than those oversights it was a great place to work
good,"Very good at training new hires and quick to do forklift training if asked by the employee.  Management is very selective on who they promote, when management gets along with that employee than they will get promoted over someone who is more qulified."
good,"Lowe's was an okay place to work, during the summer, I got to work inside and outside, I liked meeting the different customers that come in their in shop"
good,"I talk with cold customers to help with remodeling or building a home. On an average day I will work with 10 customers and help them choose door styles, colors, layout and put together the kitchen of their dreams. At the same time, in our culture I may work with customers in appliances, plumbing, lighting and hardware in the same day. We cross train in various departments"
good,Employees were welcoming to new hires.  Some had good intentions in their work while others did not show the passion for their work area.  Not enough cross-training to fully equip everyone to ensure good customer service.
good,"·	•           Facilitate customer experience in finding products"
good,"Job was fun, slow at times but picked up in the seasons. Management needs some work though. Some managers don’t seem to care what goes on in the store."
good,"still employed "
good,I had a great time working for Lowes. You get along with your coworkers and pay was fair. The only thing I wish was different was more support from some of the managers.
good,"I enjoy working at Lowes. They are fast pace, busy, customer focused, with great benefits. Although I like working for Lowes the pay is not good. The work is hard and they do not believe in advancement from within. Very disappointed and salary is not enough to pay bills."
good,Most of the time I had no problems but I felt like not everyone who was employed at Lowe's was a team player and this made customers angry. I then had to deal with these customers.
good,"A typical day at Lowes was very fast paste and simple to get off track. Everyday there was a certain itinerary to be completed. With people all around you both customers an associates most days would fly but not all the time were days perfect. Some more stressful but at the end of everyday there was one main goal to be met, and that was customer satisfaction. With that as key each days goal was achieved."
good,Very fun and young faces every shift is quick paced and intriguing loads of fun over here at Lowes. The managers are fair the employees even better to be around I’ve never had so much fun working in my life honestly
good,"I wouldn't necessarily say Lowe's was a bad company, in fact it's quite a good company to work at, it does have a full benefits plan... if you are a full time employee that is. The downside is often times people are only hired for seasonal work. Seasonal employees only get dlscounts, no benefits and technically no time off. I had a semi-poor experience with my time working here but I would say that was due to really bad hours and an inconvenient time for my boss to go on a 3 week vacation. The automated system would adjust to give me more hours every day so at the end I was working 14 hour shifts as a seasonal employee. The manager apologized and tried to compensate me for the system but it took away quite a bit of my time so I had to leave for school. Oh and it does mess with your feet so if you are flat footed make sure to get some insoles. (Mine got messed up)"
good,"Good job for someone in school or someone who is retired and just looking a few hours a week to occupy their time. Personally, as someone who is trying to advance in their career, I would not recommend it. I find that there is no benefit in moving up at Lowe's considering the managers that ACTUALLY work are over worked and underpaid. There was a diverse group of people I worked with and overall enjoyed my time working there."
good,"Hard working place, if you want to go forward have saty good with managment if its okay or not. Some department have there own policies they are not hiring people from out side. they keep there own people"
good,"I advanced over the years I was employed there. Management often changed, some definitely should have doubled up on management training though. The morale and rapport amongst the employees was great. Everyone typically got along and helped one another."
good,Lowes was a part-time job for me. for 10 years. I really enjoyed being able to interact with customers and helping them with their home improvement needs.
good,"Constantly moving, always have something to do. Management worked well with school and military schedules. Everyone has good attitudes in the workplace."
good,"The management at my store wasn't the best.  Therefore, the reason the store is closing.  I think the company itself has the right idea and going in the right direction, but their technology needs help."
good,"Not enough staff to get what needs to be done in our area.Other than that, Its a great place to work, They help with the schedule that I need. Very caring staff"
good,"Not really a job to stay at but if you were looking for a temp job this would be the one you would want. Very low hours, Very lax setting, Easy to learn."
good,"If you like spending the day running around doing multiple tasks all"
good,Very understaffed. Very few managers are accountable for problems in the store. noonenisnheld accountable. Lowes is a great starter job. if you are wanting to learn a trade before getting into the profession.
good,LOWES used to be a good company to work for but with all the changes and lack of communication it has become stressful. Continuously cutting payroll with expectations of the same results.
good,"My hours are consistent. Four to five days a week, with Friday and Saturday off. I get to operate a forklift everyday, also use an order picker and a reach truck. Management are fair and leave you alone unless you need help. You get a three percent raise annually. There really is no official training, but the job is easy to learn. The 401K program is really good. You can contribute as much as you want. Because I only work four to five hours a day, I get a paid fifteen minute break to take whenever I wish. The only thing a dislike about working at Lowe's is that they require you to request time off at least a month in advance."
good,Can be a good company to work for if their was more opportunity for advancement. Needs more opportunity for employees to advance into management for future development
good,while i worked at lows grocery i was a poitive worker i loved going in and making customers smile and satisfied i love a working inviorment and outgoing people.
good,I had so much great experiences on customer services that makes improvement on my customer service into high standards. The schedule is good for a part time student that makes good experiences as well.
good,Can be a great company to work for if management cared more about the team. many broken promises of advancement. too many processes for customer orders
good,"The retail life is not for the feint of heart. The hours are never consistent, the scheduling is no more than a week away, and there are never enough staff. "
good,"The fun coworker is the only the thing that good about this place, but management can sometimes play favoritism. Company train customer to be wining crybaby."
good,"Mgmt does not listen to there employees .  I worked at the Lowes in ft. Myers,fl and they have there suit together.  Here in Illinois they don`t. I don't have anything else to say."
good,Not enough hours....great coworkers......just need more hours...  Wouldnt find me any more......wouldnt cross train and bounce me around for the opportunity of mote hours
good,Overall this is a stressful place to work. When issues are brought up that affect your department and your work they are not addressed in a timely manner
good,"I worked at Lowes as a high school and college student. They are very flexible with students. The paid was good for the amount of work you do (no less than $11 per hour). Job was not stressful unless you made it stressful yourself, just help customers."
good,While employed there it seemed more like the majority of the employees worked harder at avoiding customers than serving them. The management team was basically invisible or pushing to get the stocking or facing done until a customer assistance call had gone unanswered. Then everyone on shift was reprimanded.
good,Lowe’s excels in thought leadership and allows for creative minds to operate within the “grey” to achieve employee engagement. At times positions feel like they are being evaluated and long term careers are reserved for assistant store managers and above.
good,"I appreciate the opportunity I had to work for Lowes. I feel the lawn & garden department was an ideal one for me and I would work there again if afforded the opportunity. I feel that I learned some valuable knowledge there, which is always my goal on any job I undertake. I expressed my gratitude to my managers for keeping me on staff in lieu of my failure on numerous occasions to arrive at my scheduled time. I needed this job and was thankful the management team kept me on payroll in spite of my shortcomings."
good,"overall i would say that i like working for lowes, its fast paced, plenty to do, and i've learned a lot from working there. the pay is really and the poor management is really the only reason i have for leaving."
good,"A typical day as a manager for Lowe's involves working a 10 hour shift, with a 1 hour lunch (total 11 hours a day).  The work life balance was not ideal for a person with children/family.  Retail consumes a great deal of your time, including evenings, weekends, and holidays.  "
good,Each day brings new challenges. The most enjoyable part is the team I work with. I am a firm believer in leading by example and my team responds well to this form of leadership.
good,"The biggest issue for this position wasn't the actual job itself.  It was the lack of confidence in fellow peers to show up on time and to maintain a great attitude and provide a great customer service experience.  The paint department for most hardware stores has the quickest churn rate.  Which means the people typically don't last long there.  I didn't because of personal reasons that I had to deal with at home, however, there are people that can do this job and do it well. I think everyone should be able to aid in every position and be experts in their respective positions."
good,Attendance policy is great. Coworkers are awesome. Pay is fine. Vacation and insurance are good. Lack of communication and consistency.  Have strayed away from being family oriented and away from overall PRIDE values.
good,"Lowes is a good company, they had a lot of opportunity advancement. They put me in position to be successful by utilizing my skill set. I enjoyed working with people and management."
good,It was ok place until management changed then i had to leave too many shady things going on to continue to work there.The management seem to have a problem with students. There was never a night where i could work the whole night where their wasn't a issue with something.
good,I enjoyed working here and would work here again even though it was only part time and temporary. There were times because I only worked there part time was was out of the loop that was going on there.
good,"well in i would go in and have a quick chat with my manger about what he would like for me to do that day, either its to fix an aisle or focus on customer service. then after that help customers out with their needs in plumbing, buying new sinks and vanities or how to fix their toilet. then depending if i close or not i clean my department and finish my day"
good,"This was a fast paced company that is constantly challenging you. Several cashier station (Front-End, Garden, Lumber, Customer service. You're moved around constantly."
good,"Lowe's is just like any other Customer Service job dealing with people. You help customers and Cashier, but even if your job isn't Cashier they'll still make you do it. However Lowe's is a large Hardware store and 90% of the people coming in will have no idea where their desired items are and, sometimes, no idea what they really want either. And if you don't know exactly what and where everything they want is, like any new employee wouldn't, they won't hesitate to express their disdain on you. My Lowe's location had some 90+ aisles and because I was 2 months into my new job I got chewed out for not knowing where something was. Moving back into Receiving was much better as being on the Unload Crew you don't deal with Customers, and the job was very routine and easy to manage, however Management always kept our crew at three people when the typical size was supposed to be 5, so we have many nights where we couldn't unload the Trailer fast enough."
good,"Lowe's appreciates a hard worker who wants to move up.  The problem is, if there's no room to move up and they now know you as a hard worker, it won't be long before they just rely on you to do the jobs above you for the pay you're at."
good,"Work starts at 6AM, loading trucks for customer delivery, contact customer to confirm time, unload truck and place equipment where customer wants it, hook up applicance, make sure customer is happy with both the applicance and service."
good,Wasn't really a job to secure a future with but there was nice people to work with and around. i would work there again if i had the chance to. Great place to work if you love talking to people
good,"Lowes is a DIY store that provides guidance, instructions, and help to all those people out there that want to learn or already know how to do things for themselves around the house and in the yard."
good,"hardest part of my job is to go home because my manager cut my hours, my most enjoyable part is my customers keeps coming to the store and look for me because they like how i treat them"
good,The benefits are pretty good and the store manager and HR managers are great. It can be incredibly stressful at times but there is a structured break system so there is some relief.
good,Location is improperly staffed. True team work is lacking. The store relies too much on a few people to cover all areas which affects the customer experience overall.
good,Great co workers and a good job to begin and get experience in but if not interested in the home improvement field of work then not many areas to move up in. And very stressful when short staffed and busy.
good,Nothing to say other than better than most retailers.  You do get an opportunity to learn a lot and discover things about yourself.  You need to be willing to accept feedback and the sky is the limit.
good,"Although the benefits of the company are great, and people you work with and for are pretty wonderful, the hours are extremely taxing, and the lack of respect for personal time is painful at times."
good,I worked here during the summer they were flexible with my schedule because I also worked a morning job and worked here early afternoon until closing. it gets busy. I might reapply part time if there were hiring just to make extra money.
good,"No matter what Lowe's I go to, the quality of management seems to be an issue. Overall, management does not communicate to each other. Even though there may only be five managers, they will still all tell you five different things. Over the course of the last year, Lowe's Corporate office has been consolidating positions. This means many single-person positions now have the responsibilities of THREE people, yet there is no assistance or guidance as to how to maintain all of the added responsibilities."
good,A very fast paced environment that is always changing and keeps you on your toes.  There are times due to this fast pace and size of the company that certain tasks do not get accomplished as they should.
good,As a part timer the hours were very in consistent and not enough to survive on.  Typical day always consisted of being called into different departments that I was not familiar with. Company showed favoritism towards particular staff.
good,"It's a fine place to work, but it won't pay the bills if you have a family to take care of. You will often be asked to undertake tasks that are not in your job description and if you make that fact know it is possible that you supervisor will tell you ""every job is your job"". This wouldn't be such an annoying statement if the store was more efficient and there wasn't so much of other peoples work to do."
good,"Not enough room here to state what I didn't like."
good,"I was hired in 2012 as a seasonal cashier, worked my way to being a full time cashier in 2015, then that July I became the installed sales coordinator until February 2016. The job I occupied after that was being a full time sales associate in outdoor power equipment/seasonal. That helped prep me for management by learning processes and procedures. In August 2016 I took my first mananagmet job as Adminastatuve Department Manager over the Front End. Lowes is a great place for growth and development and truly cares about its employees."
good,I really enjoyed doing my job. I worked hard but the high school drama of upper management really made it hard to stay. Sadly I found employment else where because it was impossible to advance without being a suck up. It unfortunate that that company has great values just no follow through. The employees have no voice at all.
good,"As a manager at Lowe's, expect to always be there because the work schedule rotation is poor. Your role as a manager is stressful because their are not enough managers/key carriers to spread the work load, so that you are able to focus on your specific role. There is quite of bit I could say, but that was the most frustrating part about working there."
good,"Laid back ,never know when u get off just know when to show up but overall not a bad place to work dealing with customers in daily basis is interesting"
good,I've met a lot of nice people here at lowes even customers but its time to move on from this place. Pay is what made me want to leave this place I know my worth is higher than what they're paying me.
good,After restructure there was no longer a chance for promotion. All departments are required to work with fewer and fewer employees. Moral was low when I decided to leave.
good,"The atmosphere is lively and can be whatever you make it but management tends to be misleading, inconsistent, inconsiderate, and aggressive. I loved and hated working there. Just make sure that the schedule you go in with is something you can stick with because many associate fight for rescheduling to match availability each each week."
good,Working at Lowe's was fun and was able to learn a lot. My manager constantly challenged me along with giving me the autonomy to make critical decisions.
good,My time at Lowe's allowed me to develop myself individually and allowed me to experience in-depth team work. The multiple facets that could help build a career are presented at Lowe's and its worth looking into.
good,"Lots of tasking, very easy to keep busy"
good,The management at Sylva Lowe's is horrible.  They have no idea what they are doing and when they do something it typically is completely useless as they are managing by the seat of their pants.
good,"Lots of great people, but management is constantly being restrctured. It leaves the store in chaos and hard to get unified goals across the store. They add too many new programs at once with no training so it leaves everyone scrambling to help the customers, but we don’t know how."
good,The job is ok.  Management if a little up in the air. The scheduling can be hard especially if you have young kids.  the shifts are never consistent. Work life balance ann be challenging.
good,"Loved working there. Very much enjoyed my job.  The work culture was pretty decent. As always, you have people of all kinds.  Enjoyed working with most of the customers.....some were just...... tough."
good,My coworkers were great. They brought me under their wing and guided me to be the best that I could be. I had a few problems with the head cashier towards the end of my time with Lowe's since I was already fed up with the number of times they had me work.
good,I don’t know lol but it was a cool place to work but things could be better. But that’s everywhere lol but for the most part just be prepared to adapt to changes
good,Great for people starting out or for a first job. Not very good for a lifetime job but pays more than minimum wage. Would definitely recommend for young people in school
good,"Lots of walking, fun to help customers with projects.  Cover Plumbing, Outdoor equipment and appliances all at the same time when associates in those areas go to lunch at the same time."
good,For the past few years a lot of changes have been made by corp. This has led to a lot of employees not being happy and searching for better jobs. Pay raises for everyone are normally no more than 25 cents each year which does not create a lot of room for financial advancement.
good,Working at Lowe's has some good and bad but is an average job. The goods are the pay rate is not bad and you can make a decent wage working here. Some managers are great and will help if they can. They have great benefits that seem to improve over time. The bad is area managers do not really know what is going on in the stores as long as its making money. Other managers will bad mouth employees to other employees and talk about very personal subjects while being mostly lazy and not very involved with customer service. It seems like a lack of hiring is a big problem with stores lately and not enough discipline within stores.
good,Management would promise you the opportunity to advance but would give it to their friends instead. Advancement was never done according to job performance
good,"Lowes is a retail store so it manly stayed busy in most area during the  weekend, M-F was hit and miss for sales. each month they would provide lunch. to earn the red vest one would have to complete all training that was require in their assigned departments. Management chipped when need be (during peck times)"
good,Good place the hours can be tough. I learned a lot about retail store operation. The hardest part was not many customers at times. The good part was the different staff to work with.
good,Management at Lowe's has a tendency to reinvent the wheel every few months against warnings from individuals in store only to reverse decision due to poor execution. High stress for lack of reason.
good,"I really enjoy customers, especially those that need translation. The hardest part of the day is when we are short staff. Management help when needed. I learned that it takes a team to get the job done."
good,Enjoyed working in the area of the Outdoor and Indoor Lawn and Garden with several direct reports. The job was rewarding but the lack of good leadership from the store manager level made the job very difficult to manage direct reports. Store management would not allow for true lower lever management of direct reports and would require assistant managers and department managers to work after hours after store closing for up to 5 hours to do busy work that was slated for daily work resets. Less the specific store manager I had I enjoyed the company and the work.
good,"With the lack of managerial expertise and training options our local Lowe's had several issues, However, the people there can definitely make it a fun and good place to work"
good,"It's a job to get you by and if you are young and looking for something else or going to school. If you work in building materials you will be loading contractors items while they watch,."
good,"If you like going to work doing the same task day after day after day than this job might be for you. Everyone here only talks to the other people in their department, so if you want to work with your friend from a different department you might as well just apply for his job position."
good,"Strong multi-tasking environment. Lots of customer follow up, designing products that make the customer love where they live, never a day the same. Many stores to work for career advancement."
good,"I worked there for about six months. While I was there, I was on the phone all day long talking with customers, taking their compliments on employees or complaints about employees or stores."
good,"Lowe's is a very competitive company. They are always out to destroy and be better than the competition. That will be your focus, day in and out. How to be cutting edge with innovation, first-to-market, and price relevence."
good,"Depending on the time of year, its either super busy, or super slow.  I learned Genesis, and Sterling operating systems, how to take care of the problem customer, about customer service, and how to talk with upper management appropriately.  The hardest part of the job, was not having enough staff to meet customer needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I helped the customer achieve to love where they live."
good,I worked at Lowe's and they are a good company to work for. I made a good salary and enjoyed the work. The only raises I got were from promotions which I got often. Management left somewhat to be desired.
good,"Not to bad to work at, hard work, You have to be fast paced, try and sell the credit card, expect to see a lot of people (customers) rip the company off and also yell at you (sorry)"
good,"When this company has the ""Home Improvement Warehouse"" thing going it was awesome to work there. I thought I was going to retire from there. It went totally downhill when the company became more ""chic"" and ""trendy"" trying to appeal to the average homeowner that just wants to spruce up their living space. What was once quality merchandise was replaced with junk from China. They would hire very knowledgeable people to fill positions in the departments, now anyone who walks through the door gets hired. It's just another retail store that has no job security anymore because their business model is so terrible."
good,"I learn to work all departments and became a head cashier,learn to work as a specialist in all departments,because it was always short of help and always ran out products."
good,"Management needs to learn to hold associates accountable, instead of loading up the work load on a few ""can do"" associates.  "
good,The culture that I was in kept changing.  There was no consistency in the way the management ran the operation and expectations kept changing.  No unity in workers.
good,"I truly believe the company as a whole is great, however the Lowe's I work at is spoiled by the poor managment. The expectations are set higher than any one person can reach and the management preaches help while punishing those who give/ask for it."
good,"Management team is excellent. Overall employee engagement is really good.  Computer systems are outdated and limit efficient performance of certain tasks without time consuming manipulation, difficult to learn all processes in short time.  Training of specific job requirements is often inadequate, but overall team support from co-workers help to achieve better understanding. Information and SOP's are sometimes antiquated, paper printed for many things that could be provided electronically."
good,Loved the work environment. Was told all about opportunity advancement throughout my time there even though i was seasonal. Looked to catch on with a permanent position but was always told that it wasn't possible. Wasted 9 months dealing with that until i left.
good,Rewarding helping people love where they live. very busy and fast paced enviorment. Hard sometimes dealing with people who want your help but don't understand basic principles about home improvement
good,"Enjoyed working at Lowe's- If I didn't relocate, I would happily still be an employee. I moved to Austell and the distance to Suwanee wasn't convenient."
good,"A typical day at the customer service desk at lowes is really crazy and always busy. Returning product, pulling internet and pick up later orders, and taking credit card payments makes a low shift go by fast. This job takes a lot of face time with customers and working one on one with my managers.  I really like the people I work with."
good,Awesome it's laid-back it's a good job but temporarily no managers over you as long as you get the work done I get along with others real good we work together we do the best at what we doing keeping everything clean neat you get two breaks and 15 minute break and then I will break
good,"Decent job for either multiple income family, college/high school students, some one looking for a weekend job. Typical day varied on position, from personal positions held they consisted of stocking shelves, customer assistance, and cleaning work area."
good,"productive and fun place to work. great work environment. always a pleasure interacting with different people from various cultures on a regular basis. overall, a great place to work"
good,Managers were unfair with hours given. Friendly staff and the job went by fairly quick because of the traffic within the store. Lowes was one of the only home improvement stores close to Iowa City
good,"is a decent company that is struggling to keep pace with the current retail environment. decent place to work, but not to grow. Company needs to move into 2018 and focus more on employees and customers."
good,"Really great people at corporate. Managers, Directors and VPs care and are mission focused. There is a ton of projects to do. Senior management has been in place too long and needs to move on, to allow new ideas and fresh thought."
good,"The people I worked with was great, and the managers were nice. But the lack of proper training is beyond stressful. They throw you into the wolves, expect you to follow the other employees who haven’t been there very long or ones that don’t know how to train around. They expect managers to train you, managers expect employees to train you and you suffer from it.  It’s the blind leading the blind. The customers expect for you to know and understand everything in the store, and since there’s no training, you don’t so you have to constantly run to other departments to find someone to help you out. I was constantly left alone while other employees went to lunch, told to do things they never taught me. The atmosphere however is fun, the people are great, you make friends. The managers are nice but aloof and overly optimistic when you try to discuss something. It’s fast paced, there’s a lot of upsales, especially at the register. Old systems and technology makes it tedious and hard to understand."
good,"This was my first retail job.  I never worked for a box store before.  I love working at Lowe's (and still do), the people I work with make it fun to come in every day.  "
good,"a typical day at work would be to show up and start whatever, with little or No direction from management ."
good,you buss your behind for pay that dose not equate to the amount of work you do does have a good setting can be a good place to work or make a career out of if that's what you choose to do.
good,It was fine because I was only there for like 2 months. I did the cash register and didn't have many problems. Just before I came they got rid of a couple of managers and that made it hard to get overrides for the registers.
good,"Lowe's offers good pay for any position you apply for or currently hold. Lowe's benefits package is by far the best I have seen retail or big box companies offer. From part time- Salary, the benefits are top shelf. Unfortunately, If you are salary be prepared to take on an extremely amount of stress, which in the end doesn't even out with what you bring home on your check. The in store structure consist of more stress and less time for your personal life."
good,"Was mostly happy working there, good caring relaxed environment to work in. As with any business there were days where workload was crazy busy. But overall a good place to work."
good,fun place to work. management sucked. Everything is a click their. If you are not in the the click you are not advancing no matter how hard you work. Not enough people in the departments to work
good,They really take advantage of part time people! I am older so I really prefer I regular schedule however it's one morning at 7 and the next day at 4pm and I don't appreciate my hours being cut for new hires! New hires get more hours that permeant part time employee's I have never understood that since we are not allowed over 30 overs and there was a time they were giving full time employee's overtime before bringing up part time people to 30 hours!
good,"Basic retailer.  There are few full time positions available where you have a fixed schedule.  The schedule is based on a matrix.  So open availability means, morning, mid, close shifts and even over nights."
good,"About 97% of the people I work with are great and make working there worth it. "
good,Recently had a big change in how our line of management worked. Negatively affected a lot of employees. Have yet to see how the change improved anything and it's been over a year.
good,"A good place to work with great employees who treat you like family, however the job can get stressful at times. There is tons to learn and several opportunities provided for one to develop their skills."
good,Lowes as it grows has been making changes that require less employees. They have become so focused on growth that the are no longer keeping the eye on the customer.  They do however promote a great work environment through parties the stores can earn.
good,Fast paced. Always need to stay on your toes and be available. Demand on mid level managers is somewhat high and I struggle to see support from upper level management.
good,I would typically come to the floor and check all my orders making sure everything was ready and up to date. After that i can start helping out customers on the sales floor with any questions or inquiries they had on appliances. Then hopefully closing the sale. The most enjoyable part was closing a big sale and successfully up-selling.
good,"December 2017, Lowe's decided to eliminate all management positions and only only gave the employees 24 hours to decide if they wanted to stay on temporarily for a year"
good,"Everyone I worked with was pretty nice and friendly and whenever I had questions they were helpful, and the job was pretty easy. Once I got it down it was pretty simple to do but after a couple weeks, the monotony was just awful"
good,The management staff in all the lowes I have worked in are not supportive of advancement.  They have to learn how to coach and develop people so they can advance in their career
good,The poor management in the end left everyone guessing and increased turnover. It seemed the more you learned and the harder you worked the more they gave you to do. They started hiring a lot of really young people.
good,"Environment for team orientated, making sales goals second place. Staffing had been streamline in the past several months. I was able to achieve my sales goal for several months in a row. But increasing demands for additional sales, without any adjustments to the current staffing arrangement, plus having to take vacation time, or loss the time, present a challenge which I failed."
good,"Lowes was an easy place to work, when retail sometimes cannot be.  I moved up a position within my probation period, but was not compensated so I had to move on."
good,This company is a good place to learn many different skills. The starting pay is above minimum wage and teaches the employee on the proper procedures.
good,The Company has great benefits but is slowly phasing out full time and bringing in part time staff with no knowledge. They don't allow any overtime so you cannot effectively complete your job.
good,"The face of retail customer service is a fast changing pace of information technology, customer service, price competition, and product availability. Working at the Pro Desk at Lowe's has a wide range of responsibility, from helping a home owner walking in the door, looking to replace a cabinet door handle, to opening a new business account to help a developer build a new subdivision in town."
good,"It is a job, I enjoyed all the people I work with."
good,It's  a overall nice job. I had to learn a lot of new stuff with the computer  and asking phone calls. But once I got the hang of things I did my job to the best of me. I answer all call come g in the building . And I help  store with there order and give them information about there product  and when it should get to them .
good,okay but too much work load compared to pay
good,"typical retail environment, better than home depot. decent pay and benefits available. Management different based on location. And environment based on co workers"
good,"I have been at Lowe's for 22 years and there have ups and downs working for them, but overall it's a good company to work for. Great people and nice atmosphere as well"
good,"I was hired on at Lowe's as a seasonal, full-time CSA (Customer Service Associate) in the Lumber & Building Materials department. I was told in the interview that I'd have a full schedule and my weeks would be booked. I said that would be fine since the job was only for the summer and I was trying to earn as much as I could in preparation for the next semester of college. What happened though was that the management messed up. They gave too many people overtime and ran out on the budget for their employees' wages. So, they did major cutbacks to everyone's schedules. I ended up going from 40 hours a week to barely scratching 20. The work itself was fast-paced, physical, and rewarding, but I never got the hours I wanted. Management didn't seem to be in a rush to try and give me my hours either. I felt like I especially was given the short end of the stick because my position was temporary. Other Lowe's locations might fair better, but I really hoped that this job was going to be a good one."
good,"If you worked in any retail/warehouse store this is no different. Greet your customers, chat with your other employees then go home. The only downside I found was when new position open up in the store manager will only pick their favorite for the position, not the person asking and willing for it. They make you work really hard for it, only yo give the position to their favorite employee that didn't even want the position. Which can be irking if you're season and don't like being a cashier or a truck unload-er.  Otherwise if you get the job you want congrats. You will never move from that location."
good,Example of why i thought... pretend you were in a fish bowl and everyone around you saw how you swam and reacted... this is how I operate to ensure that we deliver end when we are looked upon.
good,It all depends on the staff around you.  Management need to understand they're staff better and help more. People at the top are no existent to store staff
good,The best job at Lowes. You can come in & do your job. Work hard & leave work at work. There is plenty of work to do and that is nice. Management can be good or bad. Depends on if they are non biased or not.
good,"I worked in a store that was eventually closed. i worked until the end. worked with some great people, was disappointed when i was not relocated."
good,"keep in mind it is retail, you can start out helping to get fright put"
good,"indoor work place learned installs, receiving, stocking computer skills, products. working with customers.Inventory,keeping stock level right,Working Electrical, Plumbing,Appliance departments cashering when needed."
good,"Decent work environment, work culture was great, management not so much."
good,"The company underwent a management change a year ago; therefore, morale has changed.  I have worked retail in the past and enjoyed and respected Lowes for having a high regard for family balance.  Since the company redesign, Lowe's is more focused on the bottom line and where they fit in the market."
good,"Lowes offers a full time job, but the changes in hiring,and manpower seem to make customer service harder.  While management would tell us we have more people, there are less people on the sales floor"
good,It's OK not as good as it used to be a lot of changes have occurred not all for the better.other then that it's just time to do something different move on to bigger and better things
good,Lowe's RONA est une entreprise en perpétuel changement et où les défis sont très nombreux.
good,"Over the years that I have been employed I have seen many changes, not all for the better for employees. Overall it has provided me and my family a livable income. Due to recent restructure that is no longer the case. "
good,"A large company that has not met my expectations, there are far too many problems with their many order entry platforms.  Team environment, fast paced.  Computer systems limit the ability of the agents to satisfy the customers."
good,none that I care to elaborate upon.  The culture is somewhat adolescent  Management is under-skilled and unwilling to develop business.  Upper management doesn't listen anyway which contributes to that behavior.
good,"This is a great place to work if you like the call center environment but if you are growth and physically movement is important, it is not the place to be. Also, if taking and making phone calls hard for your to do, I would not recommend it. The benefits are great if you can handle high stress environment that is ever changing and revolving. Upper management changes often which causes internal red flags for me. This place lives in the gray area and things change between leaders, so if you have the ability to flow then it will work, but if more structured and set procedures is what you prefer I would not recommend it. "
good,The only reason I left Lowes to seek another job was to go full time.  After my first year I thought I had a chance but others were either transferred or hired into the full time positions.  Very frustrating.
good,Scheduling and dealing with shift rotations everyday.  Good experience dealing with customers and learning different personality types and having to work in a fast paced environment.  Loading freight and stocking shelves.
good,It all depends on the store manager as to the environment at a Lowe's Home Center. Good training available. You can learn a lot of valuable skills outside of your own department.
good,Lowes was a balance workplace.Sometimes its busy and sometimes it is slow. Most of the managers are understanding but a great deal of them are not. Customers are always trying to get over.
good,"On a typical day working a Lowes I delivered product to the different bay doors. The work place culture revolved around safty."
good,"Lowe's home improvement is a good place to work but the management is the problem. I don't want to be rude on criticizing the store but the management are having issues hiring new employees, building positive relationships with their workers and getting rid of workers when we're low on staff. I love Lowe's a lot but I don't know if I can trust them."
good,"Many many pricing changes to be made each day.  Many customers needing assistance.  Happy to help but need to get the prices changed.  Need more people to work in the store. We are not fully staffed and I suspect we never will be.  Likely due to low wages, just like the rest of retail."
good,Was paid pretty well for being a cashier. Managers were not very friendly. Was not my favorite seasonal job but was a good source of income for the summer.
good,"The employees I work with and the benefits are the reason I am still with the company. The Management is  grasping for anything to increase sales: However if the mgmt. would concentrate on taking care of the employees and the customer,  there would be a better outcome, a better success rate ."
good,Lowes has recently gone through a management restructure in which several stores are having a hard time adjusting.  Lowes is a great company to work for but employees are well overworked.
good,"Lowes has had many changes over the years, through my time with the company I have had opportunities to work with great people. "
good,"Lowes is very flexible when it comes to school, and the company will help employees with degree options. Lowes wants employees to wok hard and benefit the company."
good,Typical day was fast paced and could be stressful as a manager. I learned different aspects of the business in my position. Management could be good at times and other very selfish. For the most part family oriented. The lack of associate retention was difficult. Helping customers and associates.
good,very stressful but met alot of nice people. Made alot of new friends and will miss them. Alot were like family. Nice breakroom very cozy and a tv. but the cement killed my feet.
good,"i started working with them in 2014 and in my year there i worked for a minimum of 5 different job titles due to pay and available hours. i started off a part time weekend moved to seasonal outside lawn and garden, then to paint and finally to delivery. most of these were pay based moves. I enjoyed working with most of the people I came across."
good,Firing policy is questionable. Employees are great to work with. Management can be flexible but make questionable decisions on a few things. Overall usually helpful coworkers.
good,"The workplace is a cool environment. Great place to work, the management and other employees are transparent. Great choices when it comes to food. Beautifully designed campus."
good,"Good pay, love working with the customers, fast past, must be able to deal with critical problems, there is always work to do, always take the initiative to do more, aim for perfection"
good,"My first years were great, hourly wage and spiff. When they dropped the spiff program I lost 60%  of my income. Time to part company. Just could not afford the loss in pay. The company lost a thousand plus salesmen in a very short time"
good,Favoritism is terrible at the store i was at. Management handled situations very poorly. Advancement had alot to do with who you knew who you were friends with and how much you sucked up.
good,"I won't complain about the reason I left because it does not reflect on the company.  I will say that they put a real focus on consistent safety practices and doing things properly and correctly, which I cannot say for other similar employers."
good,"A typical work day consisted of addressing building maintenance issues such as electrical, HVAC & physical repair of a 20K square foot building, also coordinating & overseeing maintenance/repair work assignments performed by technicians, vendors & contractors. "
good,A typical day was printing the manifest for the deliveries for the day.  Pulling the deliveries from the warehouse that were going to be delivered and then routing your truck in an efficient manner.
good,"They also had some pinball machines. "
good,The working environment was fun and relaxed. The other associates and I got along great in fact a lot of us hung out after work and I also got to learn more about what makes Lowe's tick.
good,Enjoyed the time I spent there. Would consider going back in a more permanent position at some time in the future.  Good work environment.Fairly convenient to home.
good,It's a job. Great management. Hours flip flop.  Learned a lot it about my assigned area and it's products. The other employees are super helpful and nice.
good,it was a fast paced environment and the management is great the only thing is that as a temp the pay is not what they make it out to be in the beginning and that I was there for three week and the pay nor the being a temp made anything better temps get the shaft there as long time employees get a easier or better job
good,Management did not ever compliment on the work we did.They did show partiality also could not confide in them confidentially.Wojld talk about you behind your back.
good,"Good place to work if you need a job,but does not pay well Employer's supports an enthusiastic attitude toward colleagues and customers,is courteous, well-mannered and polite, works well with others to create a positive atmosphere for colleagues and customers."
good,I was a customer service representative and a cashier. I was a stocker as well. I was a cerified forklift driver in which I loaded and unload bug trucks.
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for and rise up the ladder. But, this last store I was working with kinda made it hard to think so. It was getting stressful. Hours were getting cut really bad and they excepted a lot with so little. I am able to work with what I got but when they except lot more it's hard. I like the challenge because I work great under pressure but if you don't have to cut hours, why cut them? There is a reason but I have to keep that confidential."
good,Lowe's is a good company that is going through a lot of growing pains. The company appears to be at least five years behind other big-box retailers in technology and innovation. Point Of Sales systems and SOS ordering platforms are antiquated and should have been updated years ago. This causes a bad shopping experience for the customer and creates frustration for employees who are on the receiving end of the customer's complaints. Lowe's has a good work culture and does care about its employees. They do offer competitive compensation and good overall benefits packages.
good,Love Meeting new people and being able to help people in their homes. Hated that there was very little coordination in the store almost as if your were on your own to set up your deliveries. At times the only driver for days.
good,"Extended thoughtful service to customers to build goodwill, enhance satisfaction and reinforce Lowes Positive brand identity"
good,It's a good place for a temporary job with pretty flexible schedules and not bad pay for the simple minded jobs you get. It's the easy way to float through life for an underachiever.
good,"Basic retail life: fine line of work as long as you keep your head down, not questioning the logic of upper-management, be complacent to customers and their own set of quirks, you'll be fine. There is only one angle of career advancement: management. Either stay in customer service or try for advancement, there's political navigation to maneuver through. It's the typical retail environment."
good,This is a beautiful atmosphere the building is lovely. Scheduling is based on performance and it is hard to get good shifts. Everything else is so so. Also it is Micro managed so you will have no room to slack. Its mostly work with decent pay.
good,Working at Lowe's was very OK. I've always felt safe working there but never really heard. The management was and still is the fall of such establishment.
good,"I've been at Lowe's for over four years.  It was my first job in retail, and I have enjoyed my time there.  The scheduling matrix is what has been my biggest problem.  My family time has been limited, and that is what has prompted me to seek other employment options."
good,"I would say that Lowes is a great stepping stone in the work industry. Great benefits and a lot of room to grow, on the downside it's very cut-throat and watch your back."
good,"As a cooperation not good.   Mangers do the best they can with what they are given.  As a result customers suffer by waiting for someone to help.   Worst, because of budget, hours are cut at the end of the year around the busy times."
good,"At my time at Lowe's, when I started it was a good place.  Hours were steady and they always tried to help with scheduling conflicts and understand that sometimes life happens and family is important.  They would work with you if emergencies came up.  "
good,"Worked the night shift so everyday I arrived and got straight to work that allowed me to keep a steady pace."
good,If you needed help with anything you did at your job that you are doing there are others there that can help you along with good management to help with any problems you may have.
good,En algunas ocasiones ay mucha presión y mucho estrés.por el trabajo
good,Its ok job but need better management and communication . Lowe's need better employees thats willingly to work and as a team. Also manager need to communicate better between each other
good,long days some days and no work to do other days poor management don't seem to care about employees only about making money and making their bonuses. .
good,"The work isn't the worst all the time, but when they cut you down to working by yourself most of the time it can become stressful. The work throughout the store seems to be all payed the same at the CSA level no matter the amount of work or the difficulty."
good,The hours are easy to adjust to. Day shift Monday thru Thursday.  The work was adjustable training is lacking on new hires which leads to accidents. They say your family but actions show otherwise. I worked there 11 years. And had nothing on my records and made 1 back judgement and fired on the spot.
good,"My job was rewarding,   Direct management was concerned with me as an employee.  Benefits were good.  There has been alot of migration of jobs to India."
good,"Can get crazy, it is what it is, retail. Rotating schedules, 39hr work week, hours are all over the place. Could work anywhere from 5am-2pm or 2pm-11pm. Not a set schedule"
good,A good plave to work if you dont want to interact with others(nightshift stocker)they have their breaks and lunch timed perfectly. The employees are nice people
good,A typical day required hard work for meet realistic expected sales goals and customer experience. Lowe's offers good training for new employees and there is room for growth with the company.
good,"Hard to plan a weekend off when you get your schedule a week in advance.  Hired to be a Sales Specialist, but management expected us to work re-stocking after hours.  Very physical job, not a problem, except when you are the only person in your department scheduled for the shift."
good,"I will go on ahead and say that I absolutely loved the people I worked with.  My supervisors were awesome and so willing to help you out and mentor.  My most recent experience there involved working 0400 to 1300 during the busy spring season that would hit the garden center every year.  "
good,"If you like customer service and enjoy working with people as a team this is a great place.  But like EVERY company that tells you that ""Family is the most important thing"",  they mean, only if it doesn't inconvenience the company."
good,"Good work culture, but no job security. "
good,"Lowe's a good place to work for college students and people who don't have family. Not a family oriented place to work in my experience. Good pay but over worked for what you get paid. Also, going above and beyond what is expected of you  and not getting any recognition for the job you do."
good,"worst thing is getting steady hours every week for the year"
good,"As a company, Lowe's is progressively becoming more penny-pinching, so to speak."
good,Lowe's work life can be very demanding. Efficiency can be improved if staffing levels are adequate. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful. Human Resource department not available at times.
good,"Typical day at work consist of putting out fires because  the company is not in touch with software advances of todays time."
good,"This place is going down hill fast. When I first started here it was great for 3 years.  Then we went through managers and employees like crazy."
good,I started working at Lowes in New Haven when I moved there in 09. They were the first job to call me back about an interview and I got hired pretty quick. They are good about training you and the managers for the most part were good. I just wish they weren't so stingy with the pay. I really have nothing negative to say about them though.
good,"While this company sometimes feels like a ""good 'ole boys"" company, it is also a company that believes in a work/life balance.  It is a typical brick and mortar retail environment with lots of grunt work and dealing with the public, but it also gives you a sense of accomplishment in helping customers better their home environment."
good,Pull orders for customers and cut wood in certain dimensions. Also put orders away and clean the backroom and customer area. Provide customer service to customers who are shopping.
good,Typical day is waiting on customers at the sales and returns registers. I learned how to use proprietary software. Management was acceptable to work for.
good,"Lowe's is not a hard job whatsoever. The physical labor is no hard task, compared to any other job consisting of manual labor. Management is somewhat cutthroat. Working in departments can be somewhat fun and you can gain a lot of product knowledge that can be translated to real life."
good,Driving different forklift equipment was a challenge yet exciting to learn new skills to better perform job duties. Variety of people to work with created a fun environment to work.
good,Typical day at work consisted of loading or unloading trailers. Picking orders according to packing orders. I learned how to use a stand up fork truck and pallet jack. Learned shipping and receiving. The people I worked with weren't the best. Usually very lazy and I had to pick up the slack. Consisted of long 12 hour shifts and a lot of heavy lifting with little to no help
good,"A lot to learn when starting out, but the pay is decent if you have retail experience. Management is good, minus some foolish corporate decisions.  Lots of nice people."
good,"Good introductory training in customer service and sales, with well kept and safe store in a good area (Leichhardt). Kind coworkers but a slightly unpredictable store manager."
good,"Very good place to work, nice and relaxed environment, I do not have any Complaints everybody got on well and cracked on with the work that need to be done."
good,"I enjoyed my job as a delivery driver, but sometimes you were required to try to the impossible and sometimes not so safe things.  Management would get in the way quite often and if you refused they'd just send someone else out to try.  You didn't get in trouble for refusing a job, just didn't seem to believe or trust you."
good,With all the cut backs and restructuring it's not what it used to be and store morale has gotten pretty bad. Everyone is afraid of losing their job now with more changes around the corner...
good,"The people and managers are fun and helpful, the items you have to organize are so unorganized that you give up half way through. The items that the computer says we have may sometimes not be there, or the item is on the other side of the store."
good,"Working at Lowe's is in itself a rewarding experience for those who enjoy helping people build their lives. I spend every day guiding people to their goals, whether they know exactly what they need, or have only an idea. If you have a desire to literally build your community and better the lives of those in it, this job is for you."
good,I started my day reviewing areas that needed merchandising attention.  I delegated my plan to fellow associates and worked on those opportunities throughout the day.  The main focus is waiting on customers.  We always tried to make the day fun and enjoyable while working in a fast paced environment.  The most frustrating part of the job was the lack of preparation by our management team.  This lead to headaches in our day to day operations. I always looked forward to helping someone with their projects and waiting on long time customers.
good,"If you are in need of a job this is a great place to work. There is room to move up, but only if the management likes you in that store. Basically, if you want to suck up to them for several months they will move you up. Do exactly what they say, drop everything, and kiss their feet. If you do everything to please the customer this will get you no where other then the place you are."
good,"I am a Lowe's Corporate employee. I have been with the Company 11 years. It is difficult to advance. They are great with annual raises, the benefit package is competitive, and you can't beat the ESPP which allows you to purchase stock at a 15% discount. You can easily get burned out if you are in a position too long. Competition for jobs is fierce."
good,I.T jobs are being relocated to India.  Unstable conditions.  Enjoyed coworkers and most of my work but upper management kept you in the dark about future
good,it really depends on the store and the management for the store as a former vendor for lowes recently i have seen many a great stores a many awful ones aw well maybe come in and meet the crew before you accept make sure the management has a good hold the crew is the best source of info for each store and likly they will level with you quick and tell you if it is worth applying for that store
good,"Started about a year ago, company had a major overhaul in management structure and it has lead to a much more difficult working environment , one that I am not longer happy with."
good,"Hard to maintain constant work force, often short handed staff requires covering many areas. Customers can be difficult to deal with.  Do not understand how distribution center maintains store inventory.  Vacation time is generous."
good,The job was ok. The management worked with your schedule. The biggest downfall was the pay and the way that you would get evaluated to receive raises were not great.
good,It was an okay place to work. A very fast paced enviroment. A wonderful entry level position with a lot of advancement opportunities. Good benefits and an great management team
good,"Working at Lowes as a new hire is fun, enjoyable and a learning process ( depending on the job). Once you get on someone bad side they will try to get you fired and spread lies about you around the store( adult high school drama) not cool. The managers are really cool, very like able people. There is some great employees there very few but enough to make going to work worth it."
good,"Customer driven, fast paced working environment. The medical benefits are decent; the wages are fair. In a typical day, I interact with 200 plus customers with varying degrees of product knowledge."
good,rotating schedule are hard on family sometime open next day close then be back to open again then a few mid shifts working a mixed schedule is hard on family and making plans
good,"productive work place love to work for this company, good pay but downfall is a salary cap, flex schedules no overtime. great culture, great employees to work with"
good,Overall working here had its ups and downs the scheduling was very messy and conflictive and some managers where rude and not helpful with customers but as far as CSA goes it was alright
good,"Lowes is an extraordinary company to work for, especially if your an graduate from high school or need a job that is very flexible and will pay considerably more than the typical fast food chains, That being said I would like to see Lowes specifically the management and corporate connect with the employees on a more personal level and understand the needs of the employees a bit more. Customer service is Lowes model but how do we follow that model if you have unsatisfied employees."
good,"Management is poor, because managers come and go every few months. Lowe's is a job and not to be looked at as a career although they promote that is it. The turn over rate is too high for it to be considered a place for the long term. Hours go up and down depending on how good your store is doing from a numbers stand point, which can be bad because hours aren't balanced week to week. Best part about this company is the work environment it's a fun place to work but should not be looked at as a long time job whether your  paid salary or hourly because of the changes every few months."
good,"The location I worked at could improve. Employees were not scheduled kindly. There were closers that left at 11PM and scheduled to come right back in at 05:30AM. Staffing was also scarce, and was not efficient to compensate for lunch breaks. Products could have been arranged in a more efficient manner. Very disorganized top stock. "
good,I don't know what to really say about Lowe's. It wasn't bad nor was it good. Some days were slow other days it would be hectic and busy. Often times the customers were a pain and hard to deal with but fellow employees were there to help and for the most part they were kind and helpful.
good,"I worked as a cashier for the LOWE'S in Arlington, TX. Wasn't all that bad but management sucked. When I needed the manager for a department to override something, I would have to call for them multiple times before they would come. Sometimes they wouldn't even come so you would have to call another manager in a different department to come. It would suck because the customers would get angry at you while you had to wait for the department manager to come. Managers didn't feel like they cared about anything. But the main Boss was nice. Also they train you the basic but it wasn't helpful because you are engage in a lot of difficult transaction. They sort of just throw you in after you take a training course. But then again that is most company."
good,"If you get a titled position the income is great.  Entry level CSA pays very little and you do so much manual labor.  ALL stores are greatly understaffed and they keep it that way. Management varies, however most stores (I've worked in multiple) play favorites.  Best perk is full time has a rotation based schedule and you are promised one weekend off a month, however you could be scheduled until 11p and return back at 6am....happens often."
good,Great job for students or as an in between job. There are many chances to increase your knowledge about products and how to improve your home.  Chances for job improvement is also there.
good,"A typical day consists of back to back phone sales, product inquiries, customer care problems and installation requests. Each day I learn something new about the processes that Lowe's uses to take care of customers. My on-site manager is very supportive and positive. He always offers constructive ways to help the customer and to make me a better agent. The folks on my team are helpful, supportive and fun. The hardest part of the job is not having computer systems that work properly and are reliable. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I have made a happy customer and have solved their problem."
good,"I took care of the plants and garden area. I worked with fun people, but the work was slow and there wasn't a lot of work to keep my busy. The pay was good though."
good,Yhere was no teamwork or communication from the managers.  The pay was great when compared to other jobs in the area but I found myself coming home stressed out almost every day.
good,Depending on the department you were in made a difference on wht you were responsible for.  The best part of the job was meeting new people and being able to meet their expectations.  Management was made up of people who knew people to advance.  Some were managers and no experience at all.  Very political.
good,I would recommend lowes as a good place to start a career in sales. Training could definitely be better but there are a lot of resources for new employees to use during and after training
good,"too many managers pulling you in different directions and not on the same page each with their own agenda"
good,"Lots of projects in 2017 to align Rona's internal processes to Lowes USA. Lots of rona longtime employees are scared of being laid off due to the acquisition by Lowe's. Consequently, the pressure to perform is enormous and upper management expect a mistake-free working environment."
good,This job gave me a great opportunity to work with a variety of things throughout the departments. You take the good with the bad and some days were harder than others but I always managed to keep my head high and work hard.
good,Management does not focus on employee care much or shows favoritism towards certain workers. No in between. Slow time span in advancement for majority verses rapid advancement for those shown favoritism. Will cut hrs barely under 40 to keep from paying full-time benefits. Hardly any opportunities for overtime
good,"It was a decent job, decent pay with no local competition,  it was cold in the winter and hot in the summer, it's not a very hard job, as long as you do l I'm excited your supposed to they don't really bother you"
good,"The annual store meeting was always fun, we would get raffle tickets and the store manager would pick random tickets for those few lucky folks who got free stuff already provided by the store. I once won a free Weber grill."
good,"Sales is stressful, constantly being reminded about your #'s and the job is ever changing.  There are diff. rules for diff. stores. Good old boy network. Management in the store does not know the jobs that they are supervising, therefore lack of support by store management and the senior management talks a lot. Few in the store are held accountable for their job and the customer suffers."
good,"Working the weekend team, I have learned many things regarding the DIY aspect of home improvement. This job is definitely a learning experience not so much in customer service but in the type of customers you cater to on a daily basis. Everyone from contractor to first time do it your selfers come into this store for guidance and assistance with multiple tasks."
good,Not a bad place to work. They can pay more as they start off less than their comp in Home Depot. The mananagement was great as they were always willing to listen and help you as much as possible.
good,A typical day at work consists of coming in and checking in with your fellow department employees or service manager on what are the tasks to be completed for the day. We attend any customers needs and answer any questions they have. Whether it be downstocking something they can't reach or giving them advice on what grill to take home. Also I operate machinery if needed and keep the department all up to date. I have learned how to attack tasks in various and also multitask at times. I have learned to deal with situations involving customers and I have learned how to cooperate better as team.
good,"A typical day at work was mostly supervising all the cashiers, and making sure that they had the right amount of change needed in their registers. I would follow up on their job education to make sure the received the amount of hours of store education."
good,"There are very few things that can be said in negative to Lowes itself. I see the company as a strong purpose driven, diverse place to work. They are willing to help when and where they can. They have a strong customer service drive, and are willing to train you in anything you need, or just want to know."
good,"Friendly co workers, not enough loaders, so their breaks are abused/neglected. So are cashiers. Closing is at 9 on weekdays, but cashiers never get off on time due to customers being allowed to still come in. Once all customers are gone, we have to rush to clock out in time before we get locked inside the store, MANUALLY by management. People have other jobs, etc to go to and can't afford to wait almost twenty minutes. Old system used to ring up customers."
good,"Like most retail jobs just show up, be professional at all times, do your job, and expect to deal with jerks.  In my experience most people that have issues at retail jobs are simply lazy and that is why they clash with management.  Don't talk about religion or politics.  Be nice to guests and stay busy and you'll do fine in basically any retail environment."
good,"Mas salario "
good,Lowes is a company with a ton of changes. The problem is they will either include you or it doesn't. The truth be known most of the jobs are going part time so job security is a issue.
good,"Pay is fine, customers are slightly higher retail grade. management was fine, sometimes you will work outside of your regular job but nothing out of the ordinary."
good,"I enjoyed working as a waterer at Lowes, the most enjoyable part of the job was the early morning shift, the birds singing, the smell of the flowers, very peaceful"
good,From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave expect a non-stop quick paced work environment. At times balancing physical and mental stress while serving to the customers and upholding departmental duties throughout week. Plenty of opportunity for advancement within company although upper management needs to balance responsibilities better.
good,"the customer is what keep me going, besides some of the co-workers.have to make sure frieght is done, and front face. if you have a good team player in your department it will make the job easy when you all are on the same page as far as work goes."
good,Great atmosphere! Good for Managers or first time job. The culture is welcoming and comfortable. There isnt much room for growth at this business though
good,This was not my favorite job by a long shot. The people were very nice and helpful but were pretty vague on instructions and got mad when something wasn't done the way they wanted even when they didn't tell you. Hard work and always went home sore and always took to long due to unnecessary variables.
good,"There is an excellent culture of the job. There is not the best of organization due to there being a merge of different areas right now. The supervisors are just as lost about the solutions to inquiries as the coordinators. Until it is proficient training on all ends, the workload will continue to be in disarray."
good,Lowes was a very decent job with many different parts to the store. A lot of people that work at Lowes are older and they are all willing to teach you the things you need to know to be successful.
good,"Working there was great, I felt like there was a lot of opportunities to grow in my skills but had a struggle with the attitudes of my fellow co-workers. There was a lot of complaining among them which made it hard to stay positive about coming to work. Other than that I loved my job."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work. Just the position I was in was allowing me to get enough hours. So on that note, I would have to look for something else to where I could get more hours that I needed."
good,Focused on superior customer service and going the extra mile to make sure customer was taken care of.  Associates attend product knowledge training seminars.   Associates assist one another in neighbHoring departments.
good,Worked for Lowe's for 15 years. Very good company and also able to move upas rapid pace. Very good benefits. Lots of time off depending on how long you worked there.
good,"A typical dat at work was busy. Assisting customers and giving great customer service. Management was helpful. There was nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable was getting customers what they needed, giving great customer service."
good,It was a slow workplace. I was able to learn more about how to communicate with customers. The bosses were easy to talk to. The most enjoyable part was working with the friends that I made.
good,"Physically demanding for the small stint that I worked there, but my coworkers were all loving people and cared about your well being. The hardest part about the job was the physicality and working through nights, but the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn new skills faster and move up the ladder quickly. Management was a little iffy at times, but it depended on who your manager was in your department."
good,"Working at the Indy location was my first full time position. My starting pay was excellent! The training was fun and the supervisors there were very supportive. The overall downside was the work/life balance, technology, and dealing with disrespectful customers on a daily basis. I never worked in a call center environment prior to this so I didn't know what to expect. The shifts are very long, the call flow was ridiculous and I came home every evening with a headache after dealing with customers yelling in your ear despite how nice and calm you try to be. The system always failed (constantly freezes up or shuts down completely even during a call). It can be a very stressful and frustrating job. Again it's a great place to work if you're used to working somewhere with HIGH CALL VOLUME (literally calls back to back) and management does reward you for your hard work. The pay is very generous, just the line of work wasn't for me."
good,"The people who work there are good people for the most part. There are to many restrictions from corporate and in turn the people on the floor tend to get overwhelmed in the busier areas. There needs to be more help in areas that require a lot of equipment use in order to maintain the department. When I was in lumber I would be the only one there alot and couldn't use a lift without an escort. The garden center and flooring are very similar in this aspect. Another problem is with the seasonal highers. If a seasonal higher quits, it is almost gauranteed that they will not be replaced, thus adding to the workload even more. Overall not a bad place to work but the staffing could use some work."
good,"Since corporate has decided to ""restructure"" the company many people have lost their jobs. They seem to be trying to get rid of the people who have been there for 4 plus years and although they claim it isn't true it looks as though they are starting to replace full time employees with SIMOS employees and part timers. They are doing this to save money and its dirty and wrong. Their new motto is ""Helping People Love Where They Live"" but the employees can't do that if they are unhappy with all the changes and are constantly concerned about losing their jobs. They need to make their employees happy instead of taking everything away from them and making their lives miserable all to make their bottom line look better."
good,"Overall a good company but extremely paranoid thanks to their corporate legal.  You do not want to every make any ""Executive"" decisions on your own unless you partner with someone.  Constant pressure that makes you second guess yourself.  Safety culture is very strong with very little wiggle room for errors. Its either you do it right or your wrong.  One of the best run shrink control and audit processes. Training is an issue but they seem to be improving."
good,This job was great for those that can work with minimal supervision.  Need to be able to make decisions and react quickly to keep assigned projects on schedule.
good,A typical day at work is to check in with your lead and receive your work for the day. Finish one or two trailers a day minimum. They do a lot of work activities.
good,I love working at lowes but do to there restructure I'm with out a job at the end of this year it saddens me when u put your life into a job and this happens
good,"Lowe's can be a fast paced environment. Like working with the staff and with my customers."
good,great place to work until they get rid of your job.  I have worked here for 12 years and now I have to find another job since lowes did reconstructuring
good,"If you enjoy working with people in a fast pace environment then, this job is a good fit.  In store management really makes or breaks store morale.  Corporate tries to keep their finger on the pulse when it comes to employment satisfaction."
good,Arrive at work and expected to run department and zone.  Tasks were to run appliance department as well as work as service zone manager.  Learned how to multi task as well as work with multiple personalities.
good,Great learning experience with ability to move up quickly.  High retail turnover of staff.  Crazy retail hours and full spectrum of customers.
good,Although I've been working with Lowes many years I have good and bad things to say. They compensate decently although have gotten worse over the years. Lately job security has become a mute point as well.
good,As part of the senior management team I worked a minimum 11 hours per day. As part of my scheduled matrix I worked 14 out of 16 days each month during that part of my scheduled stretch.
good,Overall experience was not bad.  Enjoyable clientele.  Hours were often cut and schedule was varied and difficult and included most holidays without additional pay.  Hourly rate was good.  Benefits are very good.
good,Need more advancement opportunities. I learned that most people that work at Lowe's make very little money. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"Lowe's provides the foundation of a good working career.  When you join the company, you have the opportunity to move into multiple business areas and learn the business from various point of views."
good,The job overall is a great place to work at but the management in New Orleans are not very friendly or managerial to be having the position they have. I do advise that you work hard and work at the job
good,"I was an employee with Lowes over a 7 year period. I worked in 6 different departments , I became a specialists in each department I worked in. As a single Mother, I was thriving, then the politics and paycuts began! I was a specialist making 20$ per hour, so...I had to go.  Lowes is only in it for the money, the employees...well not so much."
good,Hardest part of the job is freight. The most enjoyable for me is helping customers find the products that suit their needs.
good,Lowes allows you to have experience with handling money as well as direct customer service. Allows very flexible hours for high school students as well as college students.
good,I cant say much about this company because I wasn't for very long but what I can say is it was a really good place to work but it was hard to get enough hours
good,"Management listens to the workers about concerns, and they do their best to be understanding. When you are sick you can call out and it doesn't count against you and they understand if it's within modesty. If you can't make it to work in winter weather they fully understand. They have a free meal for workers nearly every month. Decent holiday pay every now and then though out the year. Each customer is seen as having a story to their mission in home improvement of ""Love where you live"". They find the best solution for the customer dream's and budget. It's the best retail company I've worked for so far. It's a great company for workers and customers."
good,"Typical day of work can be ecxiting and fun. Customers are great. "
good,"My coworkers were very friendly and easy to work with, the benefits and the way Lowe's treated their employees was exemplary. I enjoyed helping customers but the hours of my shifts were not ideal. I learned a lot about home improvement, customer service skills, and machine maintenance."
good,"Worked here for several years and it was fine. The only thing I hated about being FT is that the hours were all over the place. One day you could work 2pm-11pm, then the next day you could work 7am-4pm. However the nice thing about being FT is that you are on a rotation, so you always know your days off. Management had their ""favorites"", I do believe some employees were treated better than others. The pay and benefits were good from what I remember."
good,"I enjoy working here and I enjoy seeing everyone I work with."
good,"Fun place to work. Employees are conscientious workers and will assist in any way. Benefits for full timers are good. Hours are flexible. A typical day at work may involve new ways of processing ordering, selling products and employee benefits.... meaning new ways to help you to advance. Management, well.... some are fair and know what they are doing. All share in having functions to show their appreciation for the workers and all they do. Presenting them with awards, acknowledgements and gratitude.  The hardest part of the job can sometimes be working with the public. Sometimes you just get that one unhappy person to which nothing you can say or do will please them. The most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team and knowing that someone always has your back."
good,"The first half of my time there was wonderful. I started out with a wage of $9.91 and later bumped me up to $10.61, which was a surprise considering that I had no experience before hand. The second half of my time there was pure misery at times. Management was switched around, and my new bosses quickly turned to picking their favorites, of which I was not. It was not just me that they targeted for not being one of their ""buddies."" It happened to at least two other coworkers of mine that I can remember. Overall the system is plagued by a buddy system that corporate has no desire to get rid of anytime soon."
good,Lowes has great benefits and stock options.   Various hours all the time are hard to adjust to.   Lowes has alot of different job opportunities and advancement levels.
good,"Lowes is a safe and reliable company, with year round work. The company manages its employees and promotes a safe work culture."
good,"I've been working for Lowe's call center as a Repair Services agent in Albuquerque for 2 and a half years. I really loved my job for the first year and I was so grateful for having it. The pay is great and you have the opportunity for a raise every year. Great benefits too. Another perk is that there is a cafeteria on site and a Starbucks so you don't have to drive/walk anywhere for lunch. They used to have contests and raffle out prizes like TVs and such, but not so much for our department or how it was when I first started working here. They give out free ice cream from Baskin Robins once a month and other food/snacks throughout the year. Also like that they do have charity events to help the community. I was so happy to work for a company that claimed to ""never stop improving"", but now I see the company has regressed not improved. Their new motto ""helping customers love where they live"" is a lie. They make it sound like they care about their customers and employees but then make it more and more difficult for us to do what's best for the customers. I think it's odd how they expect integrity from their employees but then want us to flat-out lie to the customers on a daily basis. It's hard to do a good job when a lot of the policies in place don't allow us to do what is right. Out of the 5 supervisors I've had only 1 was respectable. The others would not do what they said they would do, were hypocrites who did the very things they write up their team members up for, were unreliable and unhelpful, and the list goes on. The other con is being yelled at and cussed at by angry"
good,you might like it you might not but you can advance up to Department manager quickly it's on you to make the most of where ever you work but Lowes is a good place to work
good,Management was awesome. Met some nice people there and learned alot. Its local and has some great customers.................................................
good,"For being my first job it is not bad, but wasn't what I was really looking for. I don't really get the hours I want in a week and I applied for cashier but they have me doing something else that I don't like and didn't apply for."
good,"My position in particular was rewarding at times, and educated me a lot about pricing and marketing. advertising was a main part of my job."
good,"Trash removal, cleaning in general, replacing light bulbs, bringing carts back to the store and assisting customers"
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for which has many different departments that you are able to learn about.While working for Lowe's I was able to learn good customer service skills and flexibility.
good,"Decent pay and job is not difficult.However management is terrible. Multiple supervisors are incompetent and provide little to no support. In my time their, my team had no actual supervisor assigned for several months and were left to fend for ourselves which cause a terrible work environment."
good,"The atmosphere of the store is fun because you can help the customers and discover new products. However, management is very inconsistant with thier standards and that makes it difficult to perform to unclear standards. There exists alot of favoritism and I think that is why the store has such high turnover of employees."
good,"Great wages, good security. But managers do not get much time throughout the day.or night because of the ""matrix"" scheduling."
good,Ok for short term but not a business that typically cares for your benefit . Part timers have a hard time finding more than 15 hours per week with very little room to advance. Managers change too often since HR was removed
good,thy only started us with 10 an hour and they made us do everything by hand.  It was so many people working there it was hard to keep up with everybody.
good,i would shadow my co-worker while he did sales because he thought i wasnt capable of doing so. I did learn from following him around and i would try to help a customer but i would only be allowed to do online orders on my own.
good,I was a seasonal worker for Lowe's. The job itself was not difficult. The hardest part of the job was the fluctuating hours.
good,I have learned so much about home improvement since working at Lowe's. I would highly recommend this company to anyone that is willing to learn. My only issues with the job are the weird hours that you will work and management can sometime be a handful.
good,"The job started great. Over time management grew more and more unbareable. Team help was minium. Great people, bad workers. I was there for about a year and got tired of being cursed and yelled at everyday for the teams mess ups."
good,"mostly a good place to work. Compensation is good, and benefits are also. Management can be a little unorganized and tends to have unpredictable responses to employee needs"
good,"The company is very customer oriented. They have great benefits, but only if you are full time. The part time benefits are quite lacking for the cost."
good,"Job culture appears to drive for employee satisfaction through great benefits and regular employee opinion surveys.  In 6 years, there were 3 major staffing reductions across the corporate offices."
good,I love working with the customers and other associates we work as a team We learn many different things always something new we can learn from customers and from our computer learning programs.Most of the time Management is great. They are always there for help and support. I current do not have a hard part of my job.Working with the customers and helping them to see their projects through to completion is definitely the best part of my job.
good,I have learned alot working for Lowe's.  I started out as a head cashier and now I take care of the flower sales in the garden center. I order in product and maintain it.
good,The company was once a great place to work but now the atmosphere is hostile. Management is often erratic and /or indifferent the needs of the department supervisors who are really not managers by definition but always told they are accountable despite staffing issues.Love most of my close co-workers.
good,"Stressed "
good,Enjoyed one on one customer time and sales interaction. Sometimes managers were too focused on stocking shelves and not customer service. I prided myself on satisfied customers.
good,"A typical day at work includes filing weekly paper work for inventory and price management. General sales, teaching, coaching and training associates. Customer service, answering phone calls, problem solving for customer issues. Maintaining merchandising standards, attending and participating in sales meetings. Directing employees in general tasks. Counting and securing money, securing the store."
good,"Typical day to day is just like any retail environment. There are plenty of opportunities to learn new skills and product knowledge. The best management finds the balance between managing and leadership, but there are always those who lean one way or another. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. Hardest part is find the right work/life balance. Best part about the job is the people you work with."
good,"I enjoy customer service, I like interacting with people. The one thing I have learned while interacting with people is that they come in very grumpy, sad, and very argumentive and of course me behind the counter trying my best to make the person happy and to do what is"
good,"we would empty the trucks, set up plants in greenhouse and outside. took care of plants. told people how and where their plants should be planted.took orders on patio tables etc. enjoyed being outside until aug. came along, much too hot there. people were wonderful"
good,On a typical day I do about 8 deliveries per day and work with a handful of customers in their homes. we install appliances as well as selling product. The hardest part about this job are the hours and the physical ability it takes to do this job efficiently. The job is a lot easier when you have the right group of guys that are willing to work just like you are. Management will always have your back on decisions that you have to make since we work off of Lowes property.
good,Granted customer service to potential clients throughout the day. Learning the flooring department was definitely a plus for any future household projects.
good,"Having worked at two different retail stores within the company, my experiences with Lowe's have shown me that the overall environment depends on the individual store as well as the management team."
good,The people I worked with were great. I'm still in contact with many of them. My manager was wonderful and made work fun. You could be very creative in your displays and management like them.
good,Lowes would give the opportunity to advance if necessary. I did reach out to try to move from seasonal to full time but was not given that option at the end of hire. I did make the effort to be competitive by completing all the required training.
good,"Lowe's was a great place to work, the managers were caring and the employees were nice but they didn't work well with schedules. my typical day consisted of load purchases into peoples cars and water plants."
good,"Stocking overnight, the management was good, though sometimes it could have been better then it was. A lot of that would have to do more so with working over night though. Co-workers were what got me through the night a lot of time, great friendly people. Hardest part of the job was the hours in combination with heavy lifting have having to stay alert and aware of your surroundings at all times."
good,"From my professional experience at Lowe`s, the compensation/benefits and Job advancement were the best qualities about this company. In 3 years I received 3 raises and 2 promotions within the company. The insurance was top of the line and I never had any issues. From my experience the Management team was the downfall of this company. The turn over rate was extremely high in 3 years I had over 3 Store managers and 3 Assistant store managers, not to mention the revolving door of overnight stocker`s. However my time at Lowe`s was very educational and a great learning experience."
good,"I learned how to overall merchandise. Reading planograms, set up/ tear down. How to be professional, manage and show compassion. I learned that moral is key to a productive staff."
good,"Very fast paced, high pressured environment. I often felt like a bomb defuser, often feeling the backlash of the explosions. Hours are all over the map from 5am to 11pm. It was challenging becoming comfortable with a schedule that changed so drastically"
good,I only had a few weeks to learn a complicated system  enjoyed the job excellent co workers  needed more time to learn a system that was new to me.  Although many people had similar difficulties
good,"Greeting customers, working on plan o grams, price changes.The company and coworkers are hard working. They give you challenges, regardless if its mental or physical."
good,Was able to learn new thing . Flexible hours. Always room for incentives. Employee discounts. like that they offer customers discounts also when they sign up for a card
good,"I really enjoyed working with my Human Resources Manager she taught me how to do the scheduling, the paperwork, drug testing, and much more. More importantly, she taught me how important it was to do what needed to be done correctly the first time. However, the most difficult part of the job was seeing someone lose his or her job. It was a great company to work for."
good,"I was at Lowe's for 4 years, and I learned all I could in my position. I was trying to branch out into other departments or stores and I was having a hard time advancing in my career there. "
good,"typical day at work is always busy and I love the fast pace environment. from setting up my team for the task ahead to tackling any and all problems that will rear its head in the cause of the shift. I come in at least two hours before the start of my shift and it gives me time to access the situation from the previous shift and how to plan my day."
good,Theres More Job Security than working at Home Depot. Only 2 paid holidays a year. Home Depot is better organized. Lowes pays better than Home depot but cuts a lot of corners in doing so.
good,"I get really good an consistent hours in my job. There are many different types of managers and some are better than others, but I do like my coworkers."
good,the job was very self explanatory. we as loaders cleaned the lot & picked up orders from in back of the receiving area. i learned a lot a lot at lowes.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's is management will greet you as an employee then have a meeting about being customer focused and they won't even greet customer's or service them promptly. I have always valued customer service and it was a priority at my location at one point however when you walk into Lowe's now you can expect long lines, pulling your own product, not being acknowledged and this is now acceptable. I do my part everyday to make a customer's day no matter the mood they are in! I think if we all did this the world would be a better place all in all!"
good,"First and foremost unloading is a terrible job at Lowe's. The semi trailer comes bulk loaded from front to back top to bottom. The ""conveyor"" that is being referenced in the job description is junk. Not worthy of even being called a conveyor because it's not.. It is an accordion like roller cart that has to be moved by hand everywhere. You have to push boxes down this thing by hand. Freight is handled at least four times by the time it reaches the shelf for sale. For a billion dollar company you would think it would be much more easy and less time consuming. Second, you only work when there is a truck and you don't find out if you work until the day before. No truck, no work. Stocking is the best part of the job."
good,"customer are  fine,but management that is another story great place if you don't have a voice of your own.you have to use your judgement in issues that go on. Some managers are great but the ones who aren't will throw you under the bus to save  their jobs."
good,"Typical day at work involved loading customers, bringing in carts, helping customers find want they need to make their visit more pleasant. I learned how to work with a variety of co-worker and management that seem to try to help u with anything that needs to be completed. The most enjoyable part of the job is also the hardest trying to make every customer enjoy their visit."
good,"A typical day would consist of walking the floors greeting customers and inquiring about what brings them to the store for the day in an effort to help find the right products for their projects. My customer service skills grew as a result of the ongoing communication with my customers. Although you are walking continuously, you never feel it because you have such an awesome time helping your customers find the products they need for their project."
good,"I learned a lot of different things, that's for sure. Too many to list. Co-workers were really cool and all very different/interesting, as well as friendly. Some worse than others for sure, but what can you expect with 100 some odd employees for the building. Management was one of the worst things I think... A couple managers were really laid back, easy going, and good to get along with. Others, not so much. Blunt, short tempered, impatient, impractical, unrealistic, etc.. Customers were hit and miss but most of them friendly and appreciative that you've helped them, etc. I worked in the lumber department for almost a year and it was most of the time enjoyable, busy, and time flew by. Was fork-lifting most of the time and if not on that, I was cutting wood, drywall, selling product, helping customers plan projects, load materials, and so on. Worst part about the job..? Most of the positions there are what's called ""Peak Full-Time"", which is newer to Lowes apparently. This position sits you at a maximum of 39 hours a week and a minimum of... Anywhere really, 20ish maybe? Mostly only when it's slow. But with the 39 hours however, this makes it so you're not quite eligible for their benefits package, and also easily disposable. Apparently during the new-hire process we signed documents stating that with this ""Peak Full-Time"" gig, we could be let go at anytime without any notice. Even without any viable cause or logical reasoning; which was what happened to me and some of my friends/co-workers. Literally no reason at all but as I was working along one day, I was all of a sudden"
good,"Lowes was a fun place to work, and all the managers were great. They had a great break room and very clean. great environment for employees and customers."
good,I worked outdoors in the lumber yard. I learned a lot about lumber sizes and installation. I also learned how to order building material to build houses and businesses. My first experiences driving a forklift started at Lowes. I transition from there to lumber yard manager.
good,A typical day involved addressing all of customer care needs.  The hardest part of the job was the rotating schedule as there was no set working shift.  The most enjoyable part was working with the public.
good,they offered me a fulltime position and gave me a pat time schedule. that was the biggest drawback of the job. it may have just been the location i was at.
good,Lowes is a fun ever-changing environment and challenging place to work.  I love helping people and communicating with them internally and externally.
good,"typical for me would be, morning inventory replacement paper work,"
good,"It is a great company to work for. The people are great. Currently going through some changes for the better. Full time is scheduled 9 hours but that includes an hour for lunch which is unpaid. It is a great place to work if you like to help people with their home improvement needs. It is a job that requires a lot of lifting and moving of products. Not a job that has a lot of sitting around in the summer, it is very busy."
good,I really liked this job at first and the flexibility but toward the end I didn't feel respected or appreciated. I would recommend you go in with low expectations
good,They was always understaffed and it required there employees to work long extra hours.I couldn't work there no  more because I couldn't work the 2 a.m. schedule
good,More of a job for young people with the energy to be up on the move all day. Pay isn't bad for the work you're doing on a daily basis
good,"I like working at Lowes. People who shop there are very nice for the most part. Management is helpful and congenial. Coworkers are a lot of fun and most are hard workers and dedicated."
good,"Unloading pallets, putting away inventory, stocking shelves, unloading incoming trucks, placing special orders for customers, and helping customers.  How to operate a scissor lift.  Management was great at all times.  Co-workers for the most part in electrical was young men willing to learn.  Long hours on your feet and the constant rotating shift from day shift to evening.  Helping advise customers on how to install their electrical projects more cost effectively but better quality of the installations."
good,"Oversee the sales of multiple departments and make sure that sales objectives are met or exceeded and also responsible for making strategy plans to maximize sales. Ensured that his staff are performing their jobs according to the company’s operational policies and procedures, and must be a model in delivering world-class customer service to Lowe’s customers."
good,It didn't offer very many hours especially in the off seasons.  They'd cut you down to 10 - 15 hours a week if not full time.  Though it is decent work and if you are willing you can learn a lot from the company.
good,"Enjoyed the atmosphere but wasn't very stimulating and very repetitive tasking, overall good place to work just not in the long run."
good,"I enjoy working with my co-workers, management was good, and Learn many things like how to operate with a lot of cashier during your shift and making sure all money is accounted for. Didn't like the hours I worked half of the time due to I had children who need my attention in school."
good,I worked here in 2006 at that time it was a very racist environment. But since I've been going a lot has changed so the majority of those racist people aren't their anymore. The company has very good benefits if that is what your looking for in a company.
good,Slow advancement and they say they will help you get promoted but it is all talk. It is very hectic and floor plans are random
good,"Daily Challenges with customer satisfaction, installers and coordinating production for customers ensuring they love where they live"
good,I am currently working as a customer service representative at Lowes. A typical work day consist of greeting customers and insuring that they are able to quickly find the products they are looking for. I am also required to operate a forklift and move large bundles of product onto customer's vehicles and into company trucks and trailers.
good,I enjoy working for Loews.  More pay would be ideal. Family fun days. Industrial league softball/basketball teams is a lot of fun and helps employee get to know one another on a more intimate basis.
good,Helped customers in the millwork department taking care of their needs. Learned a lot about different millwork products. Co-workers in my department were a great help. Hardest part of the job was making sure that your customer was satisfied with what they ordered since the items special ordered are higher priced items. Enjoyed helping the customers.
good,"Go in put the freight up, learned how to run power equipment, this company has had some poor management, I enjoyed working with some of my co-workers , some I didn't, going in some night's & having to finish unloading the RDC truck cause the unload crew didn't get it done, the enjoyable part was walking out the door every morning know that we as a crew put up a 1600 piece truck in record time"
good,"A day at Lowe's would  see myself helping customers throughout the store with different misc. problems, finding in-store items, ordering ""Special Order"" items, and mixing paint and cutting lumber. Complete specific store tasks when opening or closing the store,  involving changing garbage, cleaning the paint and blind machine's, fixing the products in the aisles, sweeping, and cleaning your area."
good,Good environment to work in. People are all friendly. Will work with your schedule if you are a student. Free lunches and company health screenings
good,The company offers competitive wages and good benefits for both part time and full time employees. Friendly coworkers and helpful management.
good,"How I start my shift at Lowes is I clock in and head to my department to see what tasks management has left for me to do. after that I begin to ask different customers if they need help because that's our main focus to help any customers in or out your department. if all customers in my area are ok I then try to complete any tasks management has left me until a customer needs help. Working at Lowes has taught me some very valuable skills learning how to assemble and take apart certain equipment such as mowers, trimmers, grills etc. or learning new things in other departments like what kind of flower is a perennial or annual or how to mix paint. the hardest part of the job is work/life balance such as having to alternate between opening mid shift or closing. Having to be at work from 2pm to 11pm then be back at 7am or even 5am  can get old. a set schedule would be nice especially for people with families. There is also a short on staff members which make it tuff on the employees when their department is busy and there the only one. The most enjoyable part of being at Lowes is the other employees and customers. Of course you get some customers who take their frustration out on you but for the most part the customers make my day."
good,Fellow employees and Management were great to work with. The company had many different fun winning opportunities. Along with other advancement opportunities.
good,A good place to work. Only working part-time while going to school but pay is good considering. Get very little hours considering its part-time. Not very good health insurance. Would recommend for staring job.
good,Great place to work and grown. Customer satisfaction driven and always room for advancement. Education on lowes and responsibilities is always available and expected.
good,"There is not much to say other than it's retail. You work long hours, weekends, and holidays. When you except the position you know exactly what they expect of you."
good,"Great place to work and learn new and exciting things. Also a great place to inform, and teach Customers about products, and enhance customers shopping experience."
good,Not a bad place to work the worst part is the schedule. The roating days off mean not a lot of family time. If you plan on moving up don't stay as a department manager long.
good,"I go in and the coverage is poor and the morality is even worse. I have learned a lot from working here but most of what I have learned has been taught by the vendors and sales reps and not the upper management roles. Management at my particular location has declined dramatically. "
good,"It is a very motivational place to work if you enjoy a call center environment. Fast paced and training is sufficient, the help is there if you need it!"
good,"Fun team of people dedicated to reaching goals"
good,"I had a good time working at the Lowe's distribution center, the pay was decent even as a temporary. Only thing I didn't enjoy about working there was the management was lazy. All they would do is complain all day sit on the computer or roaming talking to different employees. My typical day was waking up 3am in the morning so I could get to work around 5am work for 12 hours and get off around 5-6pm. I've learned that at some places no matter how hard you work you can still be replaced. I loved my co-workers to be honest that was the best part about the job, everyone was helping, enjoying each other, joking around,etc. I would say the hardest part of the job would have had to been the heat, On a daily the temperature at the warehouse would be about 93-103 degrees ."
good,"I have nothing bad to say about this company, a lot of coming and going with team members which is always sad overall a great company"
good,"It's not much to say but that, lowe's as a team is excellent. some management can be replaced to make it more of a competitve work enviorment."
good,"When you are with a place from the opening of the doors, everyone becomes a family. When that family is pulled apart and replaced with someone else, problems begin to surface, mistakes are made and customers begin to see a major change. Management fails to see this,"
good,"Lowe’s of Billings is an OK place to work. Lowe’s is a great company to work for, but the staff at the local store is stagnant. You get a lot of negativity from your co-workers."
good,"If a job in sales leading to management is for you then Lowes isn't a bad place to be. depending on the stores sales. The environment can be fun or somewhat uninspiring. I was a garden specialist for quite a while. The garden center was very nice because of the lack of over management compared to the rest of the store. There is a lot of hard work but it is rewarding and provides quite a lot of challenge if you want to make your departments sales. "
good,"A typical day at Lowes consist of coming to work in the mourning and preparing the store for the customers to come in. Which can consist of stocking shelves, pulling internet orders, or pulling delivery orders."
good,It's not a bad company. I just got stuck with a bunch of lazy managers. The pay was pretty good and I enjoyed most the coworkers and customers that came through.
good,"Good company to work for just wish they would be more selective on who they hire in the management department. Management is very unprofessional, lack work ethics and had poor attitudes which would reflect onto employees/team members on the floor making it a miserable place to work after while. Best part of the job was the co-workers and the overtime when offered."
good,"While a great company to work for with excellent benefits, the store atmosphere is always based off of the currently employees."
good,There are many great things about Lowe's; unfortunately there are just as many terrible things which take away most of what is good.
good,"A typical day is 9 hours, between the hours 5:00 AM and 11:00 PM. In my time in this position I have discovered that I enjoy delivering quality in service and products, and finding creative solutions for needs. In my time in this position I have found that I excel in an open structured environment. Most of my time has been spent working in these conditions. Management has typically been conducted by oversight and review.  Most co-workers do their jobs as required. The good ones go beyond the base requirements, and offer help as needed when able. The hardest part of the job is the erratic schedule, which for full-time runs as a 9 hour shift between the hours of 5:00AM and 11:00 PM, and changes daily.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction I feel when I assist a client to a solution for their needs, as apposed to a quick patch on a problem."
good,As an employee of Lowes I had a regular schedule with a forever changing task list. I would preform returns for customers as well as picking orders and processing credit card applications. Normal duties included following company procedures and guidelines. Management was ok in some areas. They are always professional and you are given the opportunity for promotion. My co-workers are friendly and whenever anyone needed help you can always find it. There was not really a difficult part to the job except for hearing the customers wine and complain when there was nothing we could do except follow company policy as far as returns go for theft reasons. The best part of my job was being a customer service employee. I was able to work in many different areas of the store and in return became very knowledgeable in my work place.
good,"To much favoritism between friends  and management working there, Good company benefits, Hours are mixed shifts. Ok  company overall"
good,I ensured my work place was neat and clean to work in. I assisted the customer in finding the right products they needed. I really enjoyed seeing a smile in the customers face after receiving the right assistance they needed.
good,"Fast paced aggressive sales job. Must be self motivating and a go getter. You learn how to juggle and multi task."
good,"A  typical day at Lowe's is when is very busy and full of customers. I learned to work as a team player. The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting the customers, then they smile, and knowing I made them feel happy."
good,"it was an alright place to work at, coworkers weren't the greatest but it was a job. customers were friendly and the boss was okay. jut ended on a not so good note."
good,Lowes is a good job for people looking for part time work. They have a flexible schedule and will work around your personal schedule.
good,Big companies can be good and Bad.  Job security is a nice thing.  Be prepared for the retail hours of the big box.  Although you did not work Sundays.
good,Lowes offers a variety of opportunities to learn and grow in the hardware industry. Every day learning something new and always nw gadgets to look at on the sales floor.
good,"Lowes is a good company to work for , but truthfully the higher management is not very organized. Lowes does offer great benefits, but I wish that higher management could be a little more organized and customer focus."
good,"Mainly stocking shelves and inventory replenishment. The management was ok, could've been better but overall it was pretty decent."
good,I feel like it may just be the location that I work at that I have a problem with. Lowe's as a whole seems like an awesome place to work. I loved it when I first started working there because I truly felt like I was part of a team. After a few years they started hiring the wrong people and a culture of favoritism started appearing. Now its just a few people doing all of the work while the rest stand around and talk.
good,"good benefits and co-workers. Retail hours can be difficult with family life and working weekends, mornings, mid-days, and nights."
good,"A typical day at work is very bus, and challenging. I learned how to deal with multi cultural customers. how to look up item numbers."
good,"Get the size of the truck, pull out the pallets and then begin unloading the truck. I learned how to unload trucks properly, as well as work in difficult environments."
good,"They're a good company to work for if this is your first job or if you're a girl. However the guys will be worked to death. Honestly if you work with passion and you're a guy, they will never give you the time or fellow men to help you complete a job. The compensation needs rewiring. The lumber guys do the most work physically in the entire establishment however are receiving the poorest pay."
good,"Because of poor management, poor decisions are being made that make working at Lowe's not enjoyable, innovative, nor inspiring."
good,I was a pro service loader nice place to find out exactly what is you want to do with your life an take your career to the next level!
good,"Train, train, train and don't be late to work, you'll be written up. Great team environment, work together and have fun doing it. "
good,"Work freight, follow up on customer issues, follow thru with contacting the customer to see what needs they may have. To learn new products and computer skills necessary to perform the job at hand. The ability to use power equipment such as, forklift, order picker, reach lift. The hardest part of the job is when the store is short handed due to illnesses or missing employees, but the best part is the people I work with and the enjoyment the customers show when they come back and acknowledge how well something worked for there home."
good,"Productive and fun workplace.  My position was never the same. One day your lifting up to 3,000 pounds and the next you are sweeping the floor while providing outstanding customer service."
good,"Lowe's had a friendly working environment. Typically i would arrive for my shift and my first priority was to stock the shelves until they were full and looked presentable. The majority of my day would be helping customers with any questions or tasks they had, I would also work on work details for installation jobs. And at the end of the day i would help my co-workers with cleaning and restocking. The job was very easy and I wouldve like to have been provided challenges to make my time their more productive."
good,"Co-workers are great, management is okay. The hardest part of the job is doing everything they require for the pay they are willing to give."
good,"its a fairly interesting job. you learn a little from customers that come in from time to time. the training kinda sucks, but not to bad."
good,"the coworkers make the job more enjoyable"
good,Lowes is my part-time weekend job. I work there to put myself through school. That is the main reason I am at Lowes. I am fond of my co-workers. In a typical day I report to my immediate supervisor to get my orders for the day. I then manage a team of 6 throughout the day and lead them through various objectives and tasks.
good,The computer training was long and boring. Once i got out on the floor I realy didn't have that much training in customer services. I think there floor training needs help.
good,"Lots of pressure, little training, Manager is usually so busy that when you do get one on one training he is constantly interrupted. Unrealistic expectations of cleanliness and recovery with little staffing in such a large area. Constantly changing expectations for  merchandising and at least 3 groups of people telling the store staff what to do differently. Customer service is the most common complaint that management has to deal with on a daily basis. Lots of reports that have to be worked daily and those processes could use improvement. I ultimately left due to my family life being disrupted due to scheduling and lack of time to see my wife and kids on consistent basis. If you are single, or don't value family time this is a great paying job for you."
good,"The workers all hate being there. The customers are rude. There are several great managers but for the most part the store is chaos. No one talks to one another and it causes people to redo things that shouldn't be touched. Head cashiers are for the most part awful. They are more worried about you doing your job then them doing their own which causes headaches at the end of the night. If you have to work here, do not work in the front"
good,"I worked weekends, so my typical day was usually busy. I would help customers as soon as I get their until the minute I clocked out. I would run the register in Lumber, the front registers, and outside lawn and garden. I frequently worked the customer service and return desks. I learned a lot from this job such as patience, how to communicate non-verbally, and to work with all my co-workers including management often. The hardest part of my day was when one of my customers was upset and would take it out on me, I didn't want to get to personal so I would just smile and be kind, because you never know what their day could have been like. My favorite part of this job was being able to meet so many types of people from all over the world, I learned so much!"
good,"Overall, Lowe's is a good company to work for. They are very understanding of their employees and are willing to work with them to help them out in any way that they can. Unfortunately, our store has a flawed upper-management system that is primarily caused by a lack of communication between senior managers and corporate."
good,"Typical day of work includes interacting with customer, assisting them with building an estimate, finding product, ordering directly from vendors, opening new account, finding leads, making sales calls, logging sales calls, and keeping a clean and safe working area."
good,"Learned many skills in this job. They worked great with my school schedule. They are a great company. They don't promote from within, and the only way to be promoted is to apply for the position. Usually they hire for a higher ranking position to a person who doesn't deserve or know anything about the position."
good,As a manager for Lowes I experienced many different opportunity which allowed to expand my knowledge on home improvement
good,"Working at Lowe's is fast paced and fun. The days FLY. My ONLY problem working there is the hours. I'm newly married, and haven't seen my husband more than 20 minutes in the last 3 days. Advancement opportunities are fantastic with Lowe's. The training there is sound and reliable. The most difficult part of my job is dealing with customers that are in a bad mood. However, I've worked there a little over three months, and have only had two disgruntled customers."
good,"they have gotten away from helping the customer, to more helping lowes. I feel there should be a balance. a lot of grat coworkers and customers!"
good,Lowe's is an equal opportunity affirmative action employer and administers all personnel practices without regard to race or culture
good,Good overall place to work for a starting position I worked the paint desk and mill-work and found it to be a great learning experience for team building and logistics. however that means of learning also showed how much unnecessary actions are taken and proved to show how adjustments take so long to implement.
good,"go on computer to see what jobs needed to to be completed that day"
good,A typical day at work I would stock shelves. I learned how to drive power equipment at this job. Management was helpful in training. My co workers were not as serious. Hardest part of the job was not meeting 40 hours a week. in fact way below. Most enjoyable part of the job was I had learned a skill I could apply elsewhere
good,usually worked early mornings in the lawn and garden; watering and tending to the plants.
good,"Lowes hires professional people.  Period.  Most people I work with there have two jobs.  If you work hard you can move up the ladder at Lowes.    You just have to bring something to the table, and just show up everyday ready to work.  Hardest part: Faking it till you can make it.  Enjoyable: Going out of your way to meet a customer's need."
good,"The Paint Dept is one of the busiest depts in the store, all day, every day, all year round. My day consists of cleaning and filling the machines in the a.m. downstocking product for shelf maintenance, reviewing product for low quantities and placing an order, resolving  customer concerns, giving them a direction and knowledge to move forward with their project. Placing window covering orders and expediting previous orders,cutting in stock blinds to the customers specifications,inofrming customers of the benefits Lowe's has to offer that would co-incide with their project such as allowing us to  measure and install their blinds. Keeping the shopping area clean, neat and safe for the consumer and most of the time I'm doing all of it at the same time. I have learned people need direction in this Do it Yourself economy and they will come back to you over and over again if you earn their trust by building a rapport, being honest and genuinely concerned regarding their needs. I have worked in retail along time and there are"
good,If we have enough employees we sometimes have a smooth day otherwise sometimes it can be kaotic. I have learned a lot out of my years being at Lowe's and continue to learn more from my coworkers and management. Enjoyable part of the day is just being their and love working with customers that come in the door.
good,"A typical day at work for a Front End CSA, usually began and ended behind a cash register. Whether it was in the Garden Center, Customer Service, the Front End or Lumber you had customers and for the most part you stayed busy all day. If you had downtime there were odd little jobs you could occupy your time with or volunteer to help out another department that was short or overwhelmed with work. "
good,"watering flowers, stocking the shelves."
good,"a typical day at work talking to customers and making sure they found everything ok. management was ok, co workers are great, good job for college students, flexible hours"
good,"For a starting out job in a new city, this was a very nice job to have."
good,"One of the most annoying parts of this job was our approach on answering customer phone calls.  It sounded like we were scrambling out a paragraph of questions right as we answered the phone leaving customers frustrated and unable to answer all questions as they had usually forgotten at least the first two.  You had no choice but to answer one call after another unless you keyed out for some sort of restroom break or lunch, etc which if you did too often you were reprimanded.  My co workers were great which made life more enjoyable."
good,A good place to work at. The most enjoyable part of working at Lowes was the co-workers the respect we had among each other and the communication.
good,"Typical day at lowe's is constantly engaging with customers, giving them product knowledge, ideas on their projects and helping them making their best decision.  I have learned about various products and knowledge which had helped me improve my own house.  I have strongly learned, customers needs.  Management at lowes is great.  employees are never pushed to work.  Management works with employees.   The hardest part of the job may just be lifiting heavy tile.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when i go beyond and make customers happy about their decision."
good,"Fun place to work, you work hard to will move up.  Stay on good side on management though.  If you dont they black list you."
good,"Provide quick, friendly customer service by answering customer’s questions, providing purchase assistance, and also help stock shelves. Assigned primarily to one zone on the sales floor, but also work in other areas. Use basic math skills when assisting some customers. I have also worked in receiving for a short period of time."
good,great employees learned how to use forklift and cherry picker
good,"Busy day with lots of lifting, stocking and helping customer service."
good,average place to work - learned a lot about management - seems like big box stores looks for reason to let you go rather than train you the way they want you to work
good,"An Excellent Learning / Working Experience . I;m able to work in all departments , operate all power equipment . There Are no limits to working at loses"
good,"Typical day at work would involved on,pulling orders for customers and delivering them."
good,"Very customer focused, customers are always top priority. I learned how to ask the right questions to get our customers all the products to start and finish the project they are working on and make suggestions on future projects. The most satisfying part of my job was working with customers.You get to know the regulars and develop friendships. At times it's difficult to get daily tasks completed while being short staffed. Management could have been more supportive."
good,"The people were great to work with and are generally very positive, so it made coming into work easy. "
good,"A typical day at Lowes is always interesting. We deal with so many personalities from fellow employees and the numerous of customer we encounter with. My time a Lowes I learned how to be a sucessful leader,how to communicate and motivate a team. The senior management was great. They was always willing to show me how to do different things outside my job scope to help me be a better employee. The hardest thing about working is retail is the high turnover with employess. I encounter some great relationships with alot of good people through my years being employed that Lowes. To  see good people leave the company for different reason was difficult at times. But at the same time I enjoyed the family enivornment I had at Lowes"
good,"Typical day has challenges due to training of line level associates needed"
good,"What store you work in determines your Lowe's experience. Two stores 5 miles apart can be completely different to work for. Do your reasearch, shop the stores, and determine which one you want to be a part of. Store Managers typically move around every 2 - 3 years so that will determine your experience also. I have worked for several great Store Managers and have absolutely loved what I did until a Store Manager that was not knowledgeable in the company's culture, values, and vision took over and started the stores gradual decent into one of the stores you don't want to be at . This caused me to reconsider my entire future."
good,Not enough pay for the work you do. They hire to many people to where there's no room to work and they expect everybody to be safe while on top of that you are pressured to work fast. Funny thing is they spend a lot of money to give out gift cards and expensive safety prizes when they could just increase pay and that would be good enough.
good,"The pay was nice, the environment was clean and work was fairly easy. But there was no sense of job security, people were fired or quit left and right due to the lack of proper management. or the circus as it was nicknamed. In just my 7 months there i had over 5 different supervisors or ""coaches"" over seeing my department. I saw my entire team but me and another guy get fired. And The team I got placed with after that were all new people who ended up quitting only after a month or so of working due to lack of proper training. so it was all just very unnecessarily hectic."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new clients, helping them choose which cabinet style they wanted, then sitting down at the computer and drawing out a new kitchen for them to look at."
good,"The co-workers are very fun and easy to get along with, they are always willing to help with challenges and work together."
good,The best part was informing customers the correct products for the needs of the projects they were working on. Anybody who does not work in the industry thinks that all windows and doors are just standard equipment but that is not the case. Co-workers were great and management could have been more involved.
good,"interacting with customers and providing fast, courteous, friendly service."
good,Not too bad I learned alot at this company and I enjoy the environment
good,"Very busy work day everyday there. always something to do."
good,"It is a fun place to work. However, i only get about 12 hours a week which is about 3 days seeing as how i only work 4 hours a day. its hard to live on ur own making that kind of money which is why i recently have moved back home with my parents."
good,I help customers through out the store all the way to check out.  I have learned a lot of different things in home improvement from plumbing to installation of a door.  I have also learned to use Lowe's different computer softwares.  Management does their best with what they have.  I get along with all of my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job right now is that it's not full-time and there's not a set schedule.  Learning the different departments is the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"Working at Lowes was a good experience.  I met many great people, both coworkers and customers alike.  A major drawback from Lowes is the lack of job advancement.  There were limited chances, an management was not very amicable to the idea of their employees being promoted and advancing their career."
good,"-Flexible full-time, part-time scheduling"
good,"A typical day is helping the customer as well as helping each other get done what is need."
good,"A typical day at Lowe's as a customer service representative, I first will make sure all internet orders are complete. I would then assist any customers that needed help with a return, a pickup or any other issues that come up."
good,"Lowe's is very sales driven and customer focused, yet they lose that passion when it comes to the associates."
good,The HR department is suppose to be unbiased.  At my store they are the beginning of the gossip and if they don't like you they will go after you.  If you want something known in the store tell HR!
good,It is exciting as this is a startup facility. It has awesome benefits and more are being added. My co-workers are great and we have forged lasting friendships. One of the more enjoyable moments of my job is to see the smile on my team's face.
good,"worked on the register ringing up customers purchases, stocked out products, answered phones"
good,"Good company to work for if you like an inconsistent schedule, a blind management staff, and covering entire sections of the store by yourself."
good,"I have worked for Lowe's for almost 10 years and I can say that it has slipped during that time.  The company changed from a growth company to a stagnant one with no clear signs of how we are going to evolve.  We keep hearing about the Lowe's of the future but no one seems to be able to make it communicate well, happen quickly, or be something that impacts the stores.  Within the world of retail I would still say it is the best or one of the best to work for.  Wages are significantly higher than most retailers at Lowe's.  The work environment is better than most retailers and benefits are solid.  The company lost a tremendous amount of it's culture and focus when long time executives Mike Brown, Larry Stone, and Nick Canter retired.  We get a lot of noise about change but in 3 years we have yet to see a well thought out plan that is explained to us and seems viable.  We keep hearing about what we are working on next but these things rarely roll out or if they do they are not major components of the business.  My primary concern about Lowe's is that most of the Area and Regional staff has been filled with people who are only interested in job survival and promotion.  They do not risk themselves for anyone or anything and will quite often sacrifice people beneath them to maintain their job.  They are no longer adding value to the organization and as such weaken the company."
good,"A typical day at Lowes is very relaxed compared to other jobs. Our store is a smaller store and is only 2 years old so the customers are frequent and friendly. Store isn't a busy store at all, I stand in the front aisle greeting customers as they walk by and when they are ready to check out I assist them at the register. My co-workers and I demonstrate great team-work and have great cooperation with one another."
good,"It is a challenging environment, where you get the opportunity to do something different everyday."
good,Im a single parent and need day hours and no weekends or every other weekend...
good,"Strapping tarps down to semi trucks and also operating walkie rider driving around warehouse building loads then dropping off at loading dock. i learned how to operate the stand up forklift. managment was good, co workers not so much. hardest part of job was dealing with all the rude co workers. the most enjoyable part of job was driving around building loads."
good,"Fast paced, Great company. Hours are tough. Typical day includes helping customers and working up job estimates."
good,"This is a standard retail place. You have to be willing to go in and learn. The more enthusiasm you show, the more you show the more willing they will be to help you advance your career."
good,"This wasn't a bad place to work. The biggest problems were the managers (but honestly none of them ever lasted long) and the fact that the store always had maybe half the staff it actually needed. Which meant those of us that were there were always doing everyone else's jobs to take care of the customers, so you never could truly catch up on everything that needed to be done"
good,"A reputable retail company.  A typical day consists of dealing with customers, employees and store operations.  The days are long and the scheduling is diverse."
good,"In order be promoted they say it is fair, but they tell people to fill out for positions and give it to them."
good,"Great people to work for.  Zone Manager did not mind getting his hands dirty to help out in a shortfall.  Store Manager was approachable, firm and fair."
good,Work as a cashier and greet customers with a required method. I learned a lot more about customer focus and what it meant to give the extra push while at work. Management had wonderful personalities though things could have been better business-wise. Co-workers were easy to get along with though the hardest part of the job was taking up for the many mistakes co-workers would take up. The most enjoyable part was meeting different people daily.
good,Coolest laid back job I've ever had. And the reason I say that is because if you like working with customers and helping them with questions of home inpovement then you'll love Lowes.
good,lowes was ok but hours and pay rate lacked a chance to keep even an apartment and shopping for food i worked only 20 hours a week for them and if a truck did not come in we didnt work. working those hours and conditions would kill even the strongest morale
good,"Fun Place to work, Great team work. Ability to move forward into managment."
good,"A retail environment where you never quite know what you're going to get. Demanding, entitled customers make the atmosphere sour. Management that doesn't care about you individually, more concerned with new hires than existing employees."
good,A great summer job and the management supports the staff. Lots of resources and a supportive team environment.
good,"Good potential for advancement, particularly if one is willing to relocate.  I found my co-workers to be very warm and helpful, and I found management to be hardworking and to have high expectations for performance of employees."
good,"Great retail experience, great training programs, great people"
good,"I worked there for a few months through a separate agency and although the work is alright, it is very repetitive and it can really begin to drag throughout the day.  If you like to think when you work, say creatively imagine, and also like to know how things work-- this place isn't for you.  It's cut and dry and has strict rules.  Some of which are spot on and have purpose, others can be without any logic.  They are also quite slow on filing paperwork-- I was terminated due to exceeding points due to calling off because of medical problems.  Problems which could have been avoided if I would have had the medical insurance to troubleshoot the problems instead of having to decide if use of my hands or the work was more important.  Also, not the most upbeat and accepting social area-- the upper staff was wonderful, my coworkers seemed absolutely miserable. "
good,Lowe's was a good place to work and learn Helpful people to work with.
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowe's even though the management team was not too helpful and there was no order to things.  I loved the extensive customer contact and issues to be resolved.  I greeted everyone in a friendly fashion and helped them solve their problems from showing them where parts were to finding out differences on pricing at the register."
good,Management is horrible.  They don't hold the people that don't work accountable for their actions and the people that do work they make carry all of the workload.  The people themselves are great to be around and are good people to know but as workers are pitiful.
good,"did my job waited on the customers, help clean up departments, restroom. "
good,You clock in go the the head cashier to see where you are needed.
good,"cashier job, customer service job, friendly. wonderful employees."
good,We were responsible for cashier out customers and tryign to sign them up for credit cards.
good,A typical day working in a call center is fast pace. You are able to learn different ways to solve a problems without management. Majority of my co-workers were willing to help out if neede. the hardest part of the job is not having a satisfied customer. Being able to resolve a problem is the best feeling.
good,"A typical work day was fairly easy, but when it came to the co-workers and customers, it seemed as if nobody was happy."
good,"work days were pretty long i learned more than what i knew on lumber improving homes plumbing,electric etc."
good,"i checked my e-mail upon arrival after i clocked in to work,reviewed what needed to be done on that day,stayed busy helping customers that was my main focus at all times.i was able to learn every thing i could at my own pace as long as my work was done,management was their for me if i needed extra help very good team also co wokers were good to work with.the hardest thing was making sure i helped the customer with their needs when at times they had no clue what they needed.i was able to have a bond with the customers because they came in for your help and they got to know you one on one basis and that made me feel good that i was able to make their day and be able to smile when it was over."
good,"If Lowe's could get itself straigtened out, figure out its coporate structure and start getting better leadership (at all levels) into place, it could probably become a force to be reckoned with."
good,I was a customer service rep for the plumbing and electrical department. I would walk around all day helping customers find or help fix whatever they needed. I wasnt only in plumbing and electrial but all over the store if a customer needed me. Downtime consisted of restocking invertory. Felt I was a little unquiflied for the jobs which made it difficult to help customer at some times but I learned alot.
good,"Customer Service is #1 priority. Leave real life situations at the door. Taking me forever to climb the ladder or even just getting fulltime. Used to feel appreicated and its becoming clear that I guess I need more experience or something and am lacking management experience. Some co-wrokers are wonderful and others are, well I can't imagine why they are still employeed there. Most enjoyable thing at work is interactiong with the customers and gaining their trust, helping them with their home projects. Very intense training curriculum for all departments. Fun place to work."
good,"First working here, I was nervous, but everyone is friendly and after awhile, they begin to feel like your family at work, everyone is open and honest with one another and we try to make everybody feel welcome. Sometimes management can get out of line and make you feel bad, but they are only doing their job. I have learned working here that no matter how true you are to a customer, sometimes people just choose to be ugly. I enjoy doing multiple things rather than just doing one, there are so many opportunities to do here at Lowes."
good,Local Management was outstanding.. but the pay was below what I could justify staying longer for.
good,"Very flexible scheduling at Lowe's, great career advancement opportunities."
good,co workers make the job that much more appeasing Management is not what they make themselves out to be but with the proper environment was a very good place to work
good,They cared if your family was ill I ran a press and inspected part to be shipped
good,Enjoy working with alot of the people there thats the best part. on a typical day i will put receive in about 5 to 10 trucks receive goods and process my work and occasionally helping on sales floor. Management are nice people who i respect but the company as a whole lacks the accountability per person it shoud have..Hardest part of job is seeing people who dont show up everyday or are late multiple times a week keep a job when there are so many people who need one and will work hard.
good,"I was a Stocke so it was very busy on big truck days, but on small or no truck days, we had to do everything."
good,I enjoyed the 40 hour work week and daily acknowledgment for a good job. They day in and day out with the same people made you close and made work more fun.
good,"Showed up to work in the morning and talked amoungst my department about the prior day, and about what is to be done that day."
good,"The day starts at 6:00 am reviewing the plans of the resets that need to be done, locating the area and the space necessary. The learning experience is great since the first step is to manage your own time in order to be more productive, and also developing a great game plan to follow as well as the SOP that the company provides. Management has to lead the way in order to the rest to follow, some managers can be leaders some others can not. Sometimes there is no hard part in a job there's only challenging parts that makes the job more enjoyable."
good,a totally productive experience---lots of room to grow in the industry.hard work will pa off.you have to be flexable for hourly shifts.very pleasent working atmosphere.the best part of the job is customer satisfaction.
good,Every day worked there was different from the last. Learned a lot more about customer service. The management team is pretty good. Enjoy working with the other associates. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customer complaints.
good,Lowe's is a culture based company that is currently experiencing restructuring pains. The direction the company is headed is not being communicated clearly to the associates.
good,"i learrn to be very fast , i have got fuss at for a delivery i made for not having the sauce, i use to deliver, cashier, my hardest part of my job is multi tasking cause i had to do everything.. getiing to make delivery's was the best time of that job cause i felt i got a lilttle freedom"
good,"I liked lowes but im so glad i got out of there when i did.. The oswego store was falling apart and i wasnt gonna stand around and watch it happen! they do not work with student schedule or at least they refused to work with mine, i couldnt work an go to school they wouldnt allow it."
good,"My typical day at work consists of standing at my register and directing customers to what they're looking for and helping them plan out their projects. I have learned how to deal with difficult customers. The management in the store is great, but the people in corporate make a lot of poorly made quick decisions that a lot of employees are not happy with. I love my co-workers, I get along great with everybody and we help each other out when needed. The hardest part of my job has to be that we're not allowed to confront customers about stealing products. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get a good amount of hours in a pay period."
good,The employees are well treated until you get into the higher level positions. Then work/life balance and fair treatment are on short supply.
good,Lowes is so scared to stand up for themselves it makes you wonder if they would stand up for you if the time came. They are big on Customer Service and very Customer Focused but they allow returns on everything instead of saying NO sometimes. Only the Store Manager can say NO..Most jobs let the employee make decisions Lowes does not! Alot to learn there which is a wonderful thing!
good,"I dedicated two years to this company. As a reward, I was supervisor of 3 departments: Cashier, Customer Service and Returns. I enjoyed guiding all three. I received employee of the month twice."
good,"Anything can happen here, always learning something new, management is decent, co-workers are easy to get along with, no advancement in the company, great being around my co workers."
good,"• Provided a friendly environment by greeting and acknowledging every customer, and maintained product knowledge"
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to go to the cash office and sign out my keys.I would then look at my schedule board and begin to delegate breaks and lunches to my staff. I would then answer phones and begin audits and delegate task for my staff. Lastly I would check the areas at the end of my shift to make sure they are properly zoned. I learned a lot from this company, such as how to work well with others and how to really interact with customers. The management was fair for the most part. My co-workers were a lot of fun and helpful with getting the store in tip-top shape each day.The hardest part about my job was trying to complete task with lack of coverage.The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customer's find product, providing great customer service and working with others."
good,"Easy going company, made good friends, the hours are not the greatest, but the management staff will work with you if you need time off."
good,I'd have to say the most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to work in different departmetns. I was able to gain knowledge and experience in different departments so I was able to help customers with a variety of questions to help me out in the future.
good,"I watch inventory levels day to day. Downstock stock shelves, and do scheduled product resets. I have learned to work with a vast group of different individuals to accompish goals. The management staff is pretty easy to get along with as long as you are doing what is expected of you. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with the demand of some products due to the nature of it being a seasonal type area. The most enjoyable part of my job is watching customers leave the store knowing that I have helped them get through decisions with product knowledge and having done some of the stuff myself."
good,Once you get to work you clock in vest up and go to the sales floor. I learned that always being there for the customer will make a wonderful experience for both employee and customer. Management would always have an answer for each of you questions. Hardest part would be working in the sweltering heat. The best part would be the time you get off to spend with you friends and family
good,co-workers range it really depends on the store
good,I would recommend lowes but i would recommend the management be a little nicer.
good,"i open and close the store at times, monitor other cashiers, handle money by putting out the registers and taking them up, work money room and assist cashiers orders, payments, internet order, SOS orders. The most enjoyable part of going to work was helping my customers and making them happy and working with the other employees because we got along good"
good,"Hello readers,"
good,A nice place to work and meet new people. I enjoyed my job as a greeter very much.
good,Worked with wonderful people
good,Very easy to relocate if one needs too. Days can vary the workload is never the same
good,I enjoy working at Lowes but the hours are scarce unless you work out on the sales floor.
good,Manegement needs a lot of work
good,I have been with this company for awhile. It's always been very busy and upbeat.
good,"I am a firm believer in strong leadership, but leadership that understands to an extent those they lead, and the jobs in which they are managing over. Lowe's doesn't really offer this type of constructive, humble leadership. I make more as a sales associate at the mall and get greater feedback and thanks than I do in my entry level management position. The goal to advancement at my Lowe's is as it seems political games and alliances. The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing a project all the way through. There are some-days when between managing cashiers and handling the problems upper management pushes off, were you get to help someone, see the inspiration and end result they are hoping for in their current DIY project and help them get it completed."
good,"I enjoy working with the customers that come in, and for the most part it is a decent job. My co-workers are rather upbeat and make work a fun place to be. I have been with the company for two years and in that time I have found that we consistently have two problems in my store. The first issue is that we are consistently under-staffed. Without the staff on hand we cannot help every customer and get all of our assigned tasks done, which leads to the second problem. Certain tasks are required to be finished before 10am, and on busy mornings this is not possible without more staff."
good,"Our store was beyond customer focused. Lowe's is generally a great company on paper, but working there is completely different. At first management is very friendly and concerned, but you quickly see how fake they are. Some are very unprofessional, and talk badly about the employees, use profanity inappropriately, and are hypocrites when it comes to policies. Co workers at this store make work enjoyable. Good for partime work, wouldn't recommend as a place to retire. They do not like employees to talk at all, unless it is strictly work related. I can't stress how much it felt like prison, but we made the best of it."
good,Depending on the shift the day would start with a double check that the night shift had been able to finish the nightly check list. The majority of the day is spend zoning and providing customers with support.The end of the shift is primarily stocking and going through the nightly check sheet.
good,"Working at the Lowe's RDC was hard work. The trailers were hot, the building was sweltering hot in the summer and cold in the winters. However, I had a strict schedule and I liked that. I knew what I could plan to do on my days off and unless mandatory overtime was called, I knew I could do what I liked. During the spring and during the fall overtime was all but guaranteed. This helped when saving up for summer vacations and saving up for Christmas."
good,"A typical day at lowes was hot , a workout, but cool if everyone did what they had to do. I also learned how to work with a team and how to get the job done until the manager say it was done. The hardest part would be if I was working with someone who didn't like to work and I had to carry their load.."
good,"I was charged with interacting with all customers in my department. I worked in the outside lawn and garden department as well as lumber. This job was satisfying in all regards except for management. They tended to be apathetic about many operational problems as well as scheduling. However, customer interaction made the job worthwhile."
good,This company had a problem with diversity in the workplace.
good,"Overall a good company to work with. You will work in a department that will be your responsibility to maintain each and every day. There might be stocking involved or special training. It can be heavy work, so being in shape does count. Great co-workers, and you get to work with lots of neat products. There is a discount from the store for employees. Its not much but it helps."
good,"I believe that lowes is a good company, but not all of its stores are good to work at. Poor teamwork, lack of apperciation and poor communication from some of the management at this lowes."
good,"Enjoyed working for them, learned alot, just wanted something that paid more"
good,First time in retail and was a good experience . Would like to be back in the field doing what I enjoy most.
good,"Maybe due to management, but I found it a very hard place to work. They are very demanding and not at all understanding. Expected you to be helping out in other departments due to the fact that they would not hire enough people to cover the floor. There might be days where I was the only person covering 1/3 of the store alone. And you could forget going home at your scheduled time, if you were closing. They would hold you over until the entire store looked good....but better not get overtime! If at the end of the week you were into overtime, they would make you take a 4 hr lunch break...just send me home early already!!!"
good,would suggest this company to work for but maybe not this store
good,Commercial and residental building materials deliveries locally.
good,"Good place to work, always keeping you on your toes from working on the register to communicating with customers."
good,"The store is very big so there are a lot of people to get along with right away. When the store (or your department) is busy and has customers in it, the day goes by fast and everything is great. When the store is slow it gets very boring and tedious. I gained a lot of knowledge of outdoor power equipment though, which is coming in handy."
good,"Retail job, so customers are tough to deal with, but they company is good and do make you feel valued if you work hard"
good,Working at Lowe’s you would want to knw a lot of things. A customer will ask you for something in the store that may no be in your department. So you should be able to assist he or she.
good,"Busy retail environment.  Retail work schedule on a rotational basis.  Can start very early in the morning or end very late at night.  Generally, coworkers are very helpful."
good,The culture has changed and it's all about how Wall Street and investors look at our fiscal bottom lines. The employee is given additional responsibilities with no compensation.
good,"Really don't have much to say long hours, low pay great people to work with, poor management. I'm just looking for better pay and to feel more comfortable and appreciated at work"
good,"they have associate appreciation events many times a year, and bonuses if the store does well. The associates are like family and work together to strive for sucess"
good,As an associate there are many ways to advance within the store for specialist/manager positions. The work/home life have worsened order my time there.
good,Worked in several stores. The best store was in Ranch Santa Margarita. Excellent Management Team. Staff worked very well together. Petal MS was also a great store with great management and staff.
good,"Tons of hours! Relentless days! Must be very flexible and be a self motivator, self learner,  with a great attitude! As a salary employee scheduled to work 11 hour days 5 days a week paid on a 40 hour week"
good,"Great company and career for the most part, only problem is upper management if you're not in the good ol boy club, you won't be around long.  Even if you run a store making sales and profit."
good,A typical day at work would be me opening at the Pro Service area with my co workers. Setting up coffee for guests to come. Greeting guests genuinely as they come and wishing them a warm farewell as they leave the store. Suggesting protection plans and replacement plans when necessary. I try to help out my coworkers with any need they may have in the best way I can. Try to keep a good communication with co workers and guests.
good,I enjoyed working by myself and learning about the different departments.  I applied to other jobs in the store but moving to a different position is difficult.
good,"It is a large company that makes it kind of feel like they don’t always support their employees, especially in the case of a rude or self-entitled customer. Was a decent job at the time"
good,"The majority of departments have a plethora of responsibilities. You will be expected to engage with customers while also stock shelves, down stock items, use power equipment and use multiple computer selling and info software, daily."
good,"Great company, but management wasn’t. Also, Not too many chances on advancing in your job here. Working here you get to meet good people and they begin to be the only reason you want to stay working here."
good,"You will need to be able to multitask and work under pressure. The job is very busy and to get things done in a good amount of time, multitasking will be your best friend!"
good,"Lowe's was my very first job, and I am very grateful for that. The environment was very welcoming and everyone working there was very helpful when I needed it. My typical daily tasks included helping our customers as best to my ability and in a friendly manner. It did not matter if they asked in your department, or if they needed help in another. Working at Lowe's helped me overcome my social shyness and developed my social interaction skills with ""strangers"". If I did not know the answer to a customer's question, my managers were more than happy to help me with the problem. This is where I learned most of the information I needed to sell products I knew little about. Other employees throughout the store also helped me to understand more about items and supplies customers often asked me about that did not necessarily relate to my department. Co-workers were also very helpful when I could not lift an item that was too heavy for just myself to lift. But the hardest part of the job was, unfortunately, dealing with rude customers who felt they knew more than I did. Yes, there were definitely people who came into my department (Hardware) who clearly had more knowledge, but sometimes, there would be someone who didn't quite know what they were looking for, but were too proud to admit they needed my help. (Most were men who did not want the help of a woman.) This did not deter me, though! I was still able to enjoy my job. Every day I looked forward to going to work and seeing friendly faces everywhere, knowing I'd be inspired to do my best and to keep pushing forward, learning more"
good,Lowe's is a great place to work but needs better pay to keep employees satisfied. Managers are very helpful and knowledgeable in their departments. Good company
good,"It was not a bad place to work, I moved from the north eastern parts of the country to the south. It seemed logical to start fresh, which is why I did not stay with the company!"
good,"the floor managers are really knowledgable, but the store manager(s) not so much. they dont seem to care about employees morale or personal lives. just the numbers on the white board."
good,"I liked working at Lowe's. meeting new work associates, work as a team. making sure the customers come first by assisting with there needs and loading there materials in there vehicles when they need help."
good,Each store is different and filled with different challenges and people. So you never know how good or bad it is. The main thing is to make sure you review your job description and ask questions if you need to.
good,"I loved working with my co-workers, bosses, most customers. However, Lowe's wants you to work random schedules that change constantly. As a mom and, really, a human being, it was difficult to make my accommodate the schedule changes each week. I don't see how most people with a life will be able to manage that without stress."
good,Plenty of opportunities with no chance of advancement. Sometimes hard to talk to management. Lack of trust. Rely on you to do jobs out of your area. I enjoy being outside.
good,"Lowe's is a face but relaxed environment, that is not to stressful on being able to spend time with family or other daily activities throughout the work wee,"
good,"A typical day at work for employees on the sales floor, check in with the current employee covering your department, greet and service every customer possible, continue replenishing products for consumers, maintain clean and safe work area, always try to communicate any issues with your managers on duty, the hardest part of the job the ratio of employees to consumers"
good,"Lowes was a busy and interesting place to work.  I liked working "
good,I treated lowes as a temporary job I did my work to the fullest and made sure to do everything I could to make work as productive as possible it was an okay exoerience
good,"I love my job, the people I work with & the customers but I would love to find a job with consistent hours mon-Friday & preferably weekends off to spend with my family"
good,"training new hires"
good,"You must work in multiple departments not just your own because it is always understaffed with terrible scheduling. If you don't finish your tasks/projects fast, even with customer interruptions, the managers get upset. If you are a Part-Timer, you get little to no benefits even if you have been there for longer than a year, and you only get 12 to 20 hours per week year round with the exception of busy holiday months where you can get 16 to 24 hours a week. There is no overtime allowed or you get punished with less hours later in the week and/or get written up. Part-time employees also get paid a lot less than full-time employees even if you have been there longer than a full-timer. Only full-time employees ever get recognized for their work, especially if you are good friends with a manager. You are expected to do a lot of work, even if you're just an associate and not a specialist, with little pay."
good,If you don’t now down to the managers like they are God then you don’t get promoted to a higher paying job nor do you get full time!! Worked there 5 1/2 years and was never full time!! Only because I didn’t lay down for the managers!!!
good,Lowe's is a fast paced environment that is changing constantly to better serve customers. The most enjoyable aspect of my job is interacting with my associates and developing them to move to higher positions.
good,The company offers good pay and benefits to it's full time employees. Hours and schedules can be on the crazy side. Some stores are hard to move up in.
good,"A typical work day can be slow where you have to find something to do to be productive, then there’s most days your very busy, running around, helping people and answering the phone."
good,"On Tuesdays and Fridays are the hardest with the appliance truck, which requires the use of a dolly and a lot of strength to get them all off of the truck. I learned that even if you apply for one position and are told that you might have to cover one more on rare occasions, that you'll have to work at least one more a lot of the time. The people that work there can be really fun to talk to, but there is not enough communication and then people start getting angry with each other. The hardest part is being in the middle of a tug-of-war match between my supervisor (whom wants me to stay in the receiving area) and the delivery Assistant Manager (whom wants to constantly send me on deliveries because they do not have enough people). Another hard part is not knowing exactly if your position will be around much long, because the new CEO is cutting a lot of in-store positions and is out-sourcing them to third party companies."
good,"My position as a lumber specialist is a very fast paced and physical position.  It is very customer service oriented position that requires significant attention to detail.  I work with huge saws, fulfill orders for contractors and customers while unloading and organizing large quantities of lumber, concrete and building materials.  My position requires me to be alert and able to multitask."
good,Working at Lowe's can be beneficial when it comes to learning the skills of trade jobs. You can learn how to do the jobs in the real world based on the department you are placed in. For example if you work in the Plumbing department over time you will pick up on a knack for plumbing which in return could save you some money when it comes to either fixing plumbing problems yourself at home or hiring an expensive plumber to do the job for you.
good,This is an overall great place to work. The people are like family and we all try to take care of one another. It has its ups and downs but thats every company.
good,The job is wonderful I genuinely enjoy work with my associate unfortunately some folks just want to be a friend. I understand people wanna be friends but at a working place environment it’s difficult to work you’ll get distracted personally I don’t mind being friends but only outside of work
good,"Unorganized and stressfull don't waste your time here, management is not willing to listen too any suggestions to make things better, it's almost as if they like disorder"
good,"Very unpredictable sometimes but that's to be expected in the refrigeration industry, Texas based with a lot of travel involved. May not be what a family man would want but then again, no HVAC career is very kind to family schedules. Overall, a good experience."
good,"A typical day at Lowe's for me was always basically being a runner. I helped people load merchandise into their vehicles, helped unload the semi-trucks carrying new merchandise, gathered shopping carts, etc. Basically, whatever the managers needed done at the time is what I did. Management, at least with me, was very inconsistent. When I would let managers know of a need I had, they would not always follow through. However, they can be very understanding and helpful quite a bit as well. Not to get into specifics, but the workplace culture seems kind of dull. The most difficult part is trying to balance the overwhelming amount of tasks given to you by multiple people. The best thing is sometimes getting an opportunity to work alone without intrusion from others."
good,"Fast paced work environment, safe work environment, decent paying job, good hours. But they expect to much out of some employees and quarterly safety bbq’s!"
good,Working at Lowe’s is kind of annoying when you have no coverage but you have to make it work because that is very often. The staff is very friendly at my Lowes which is the reason it is hard to leave. The customers are usually friendly and thankful.
good,Good job if you don't mind weekend and holiday work and don't have small kids. You will miss out on so much of their stuff. Hours suck as they can work you any shift from 5am to 11pm and anything in between.
good,"Good group of employees at our store. Management was good, should have been paid more for all I/We do. lack of cooperation at times from management and fellow employees for my specific job duties."
good,"Much like any other large retail store. They operate off of the daily profit/loss bottom line & adjust manpower & most everything else based on that bottom line. Some good people, hard work at times, quite a bit of turnover, corporate management is lacking as in most retail stores."
good,Worked there work schedule was tough one weekend a month off. Started got a Sunday - Friday off couldn't get no one to work on weekend so took my Sunday off made it a Monday-Friday. Co-worker who was out for medical leave for 9 mos got to keep his. Had to work one week 7 days in a row once a month per schedule then only got one day off. Not a good place to work.
good,"Lowe's has been my home for the last five years, I have met and have enjoyed working with some of the awesome folks in Indianapolis as well as all over the country. The job has its high and low moments as with any job."
good,Working at this company provides plenty of opportunities for a raise based on work ethic. Most near everyone is there to get their job done. Most of the way it is managed can be questionable.
good,"Great place to get work experience. I learned how to use a forklift, reach forklift, order picker and motorized pallet jack there. I also worked as a sales associate there. The work environment is great. Theres always something to do when you're not helping customers."
good,"It's like any other job so its run run run or hurry up and wait.  Depending on your personality, you will find great interaction along with helping the customer."
good,Excellent company to gain work experience with. Develop your work ethics and learn customer service. Opportunity to grow within a community of like minded people.
good,I liked my job at lowes would still be there if I didnt move loved moving around I tried to transfer but that didnt work so overall I kinda felt let down
good,Very hard job physically. Top management makes the money. Specialist are expected to do more than sales. I enjoy customers and my co workers but the company's corporate scheduling is very hard to work and have a normal life.
good,A typical day working for Lowe's included communicating with peers as well as giving the customers the best experience while trying to find and assist the customer with any product asked about.
good,"Its a good job for if you are in school or already have a job and just want something on the side. The pay is alright but Management is very lazy. When you run into an issue that require a managers attention, there is a lot of ""I am busy, you need to handle it"" when the customer specifically requested the mangers time. Hours are very inconsistent. One week you could be scheduled everyday, while the following you could be off all but 3 days. it is not the job to lean on if you are needing to pay rent."
good,"Good company, but sadly not enough associates to meet our customers needs.  Long waits at customer pick up and service desks on the weekends.  Good managers doing the best they can in an understaffed situation."
good,Good benefits and options to move up but management team does not communicate well with each other. It's hard to balance work and home with their rotating schedules  they also see work comes first before personal life
good,"Lowes is in a period of transition. Historically our branch of the company was a great work environment, with good managers and a strong commitment to providing a positive customer experience. "
good,"So, as a receiver at lowes, i feel like i'm looked down upon just because of my position. I am a high school student, they have me working Thursday-Sunday 5-10 every week and have asked to move to a  different department several times and have not even heard back from the management. so overall, a good environment, but my experience is not very good, its stresses me out and i haven't liked it since i asked to move to a different department since i started working there."
good,The company has a great work/life balance.  Limited room for career growth is the biggest challenge.  They celebrate good safety culture and have a good handle on their safety program.
good,"- the managers were really laid back. Didn't care if you needed to call off "
good,It is not a stressful job it was actually very relaxed. The people and mangers where cool. The only reason to leave is the pay is not going to support a family.
good,Great group of people to work with.  Always say everyone needs to at least work a year in retail.  With the introduction of the new CEO plenty of changes are coming down the pipeline.  Some are great others are something to get use to.  For the most part I enjoy working there.
good,Jobs at my location were recently relocated back to headquarters in Mooresville. My experience with the corporate office is that they are slow to move on projects and often forget who the decision maker. They are slowing improving as new management has been brought in but they have a long way to go to make employees feel excited and included in their next steps.
good,"Working retail as a part time seasonal worker, so do not expect weekends off. Low pay to start not enough to live reasonably well less than Walmart or Target-glad I have a second job.."
good,Working with Lowe’s made it possible to work in a diverse workplace along with learning different techniques in bringing ideas to the company to help it grow.
good,"I feel that lowes is a good place to work. It is organized, and well managed. I feel that they do not hire accordingly under throughout the stores for spec list positions. No training programs."
good,"If you are a driven person this job is for you. Part time shifts but longer hours,. have to wear steel toe boots even as a cashier.  not a simple job as it seems."
good,"Many different avenues as far as where your entry level job could lead you with this company. Its a good first job for teenagers, yet a good job for the older generation looking to fill days who have a special skill in certain fields(Plumbing, Electrical, Garden, Millworks & Lumber)"
good,"The hardest part is you got like ten trucks to load. I had to keep all my red lights so that we wouldn't get back up. It was steady work, I always had something to do."
good,I loved management and co-workers. My main problem was the crazy policy of working late into the night and then having to open early in the morning during the same week.
good,"Management roles are complex and demanding.  Retail schedules are rough.  Lots of long days and closing shifts until 12a.  1 weekend off per month.  Compensation is fair and  bonuses are achievable, however maintaining a family or social life working these hours is extremely difficult.  Company is mission oriented and productivity driven.  A good team can achieve great success."
good,"Management has poor character judgement. Schedule goes out 3 weeks which makes it hard to plan anything short notice, but is also nice because you know when your working plenty in advance. I've worked 3 positions in the store and received little to no training for any of them."
good,"I work at Lowe's to support my family while looking for a career. There are career options at Lowe's, but it does not appeal to me. I wish to have a different career path."
good,"Day at work: "
good,"The company could be a great place. However, the socio-political mandate seems to rule over good sound hiring decisions. The store needs more structure and less ""wing it"" attitude. The people they hire simply don't care. Which, in turn, places the burden on the experienced workers. Which, in turn, causes THEM to care less or leave. They think they deserve a job instead of responsibilities. The fact that management thinks they can hire anyone that rolls in and middle management can just mold them into ""super worker"" is ridiculous. If you are hiring people that need ""encouragement"" from day one, there is an issue. WAY too much dead weight at all levels of the company. It didn't use to be this way. "
good,I would go in and get straight to work either loading a customers vehicle with lumber or stocking shelves with lumber. Making sure that I had a clean and safe working environment with costumer complaints and wishes daily.
good,not a terrible place to work at. it gets easy once you become familar with the location of things and how things are done at lowes. overall lowes is a laid back place to work at. summer time is fun and busy but winter time sucks due to no hours and no work to do.
good,"I deliver product to customers with home improvement needs.  I learned how to place items in customers home neat and safe.  The management team supports the drivers when certain deliveries are not safe.  Lowe's is a great company and focuses on providing great service.  The hardest part of the job is getting merchandise to fit in small spaces, and the customer wants to make it fit.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and watching them smile while receiving their new appliances."
good,"my experience in Lowes myt not be the same with others."
good,"My particular stores management seems to not all be on the same wave length. One manager says to prioritize the customer first, the next says you have to prioritize your duties over the customer, or you are not allowed to help other associates that are in desperate need of help if your duties are not done."
good,I worked at Lowe's for nine years and found it to be a great company with excellent management. I enjoyed many benefits while working there and would recommend it as a potential employer to anyone who asked. I cannot say enough positive things.
good,I loved working at Lowe’s. It was simple tasks and had great benefits along with very welcoming staff. I felt safe and comfortable to ask questions when I first started.
good,This is a good place to work but i am currently looking for a full time job with set hours. I like that they work with you with scheduling but I wish the part time hours were more guaranteed
good,Great work environment and good culture. Management is good but could be somewhat better. The company seems more interested in cutting hours rather than ensuring there are enough personnel working to effectively cover all departments at all times to ensure customers receive great customer service.
good,"I learned a lot because I wanted to and I asked for training in other areas other than my own. I'm glad I did. It helped me move around in the company. Not up, but around."
good,"New CEO - so company is in flux.  Employees struggling to fully comprehend benefits and leaves.  Have had staff struggle to get answers on leaves, pay during leaves, changing benefits during work-life events."
good,"There are always tasks to be done. If you are looking for an office job, this isn't the job for you. It's a great place for advancement in your career and they give plenty of opportunities  to develop skills such as driving power equipment"
good,"I feel that Lowe's is one of the only companies that values the consumer's opinion. Upper-Management is very critical of itself and that is a very good thing, as it keep it always improving."
good,"While working at Lowes over the last two+ years, our staffing as been cut drastically across the building and by half in my department while the work load has increased by 30%. "
good,I was a loader so my job was to see if customers needed help while in the store and to help them load and sometimes unload product from their vehicles.
good,"Not enough hours, need full time hours"
good,Some of the management is great. Some of the older cashiers are absolutely catty and mean. Lot's of drama but just try to keep to yourself. Customers are morons.
good,"I enjoy leaning about every products Lowes  carry and sell  in the stores , helping customers and build trust to everyone .The hardest part was the lack of hours."
good,"There are lots of training classes available. Those things may include plumbing, electrical, lawn and garden and also outdoor planting tips. They are  limitless on things to learn and new things to do."
good,Awesome campus with all of the amenities you would expect from a company like Lowe's.  Flexible work environment with the freedom to work around your schedule.
good,"Overall was a great environment. no complaints about staff.  Need to pay just a little more for the job i was doing. Overnight, hand unloading trucks, and was costly to myself. I had a pallet accidentally pushed on me, that caused me to have a surgery. i wanted to return< but i was seasonal and no job available. Had opportunity to take a lead position, but was let go."
good,"Good climate controlled environment, Co-workers are nice. Managers are pleasant and willing to teach and mentor others. Currently short on staff and that has created some stress for co-workers"
good,Lowe's was a good company to work for.  Competitive pay and working hours Excellent benefits.  Employee motivation.  Promotion opportunities.  Relocation was good.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's, but some of the management could have been better. I became forklift certified from this job, however, and I am thankful for that."
good,"Its a busy place to work and i enjoy my co workers, Its a very good job straight out of high school. As a part time employee i would like to have benefits."
good,"Lowe’s is an excellent place to work at. The pay is good, the people are friendly, the managers are always available to talk when you need them. With every business, there are good and bad days, but overall, Lowe’s has a really good environment to work in."
good,Company has lots of room for advancement. Lots of training if you show the desire and want. Management will vary from store to store and style to style. Lowe's is a good company and has been extremely strong through all the economic times
good,Was a great place to work the company unfortunately is going in a bad direction. Hopefully the new ceo will turn this around. I enjoyed my 10+ years there.
good,New company direction makes it hard for employees to move up because of so few management postions available. This in turn leads to higher turnover and lower morale
good,You have to be flexible on your availability or it can be almost impossible to advance in your career with Lowe's. There is no health care provided for part time employees.
good,I would greet customers when they approached my register. I would ring up their items. I would make change if they paid in cash. I tried to get customers to sign up for a credit card.
good,There are a lot of good people her in the work place however the high demand of the retail world today places a lot of pressure on them. I’m today’s culture every retailer wants to be competitive in store as well as online however the logistics required to be successful at this can place a heavy burden on employees. Most employees in the work place strive to execute their job requirements however sometimes feel that what is required of them is either too much or not supported probably from an operations standpoint. Overall the people are great and great to work with but the company has some processes to improve on.
good,"Most days are great, but it is still retail. A lot of problem-solving skills are recommended if you want to work here. I love learning from anyone I can, including customers. Sometimes they are the experts on the use of a certain product."
good,Fun working place nice co-workers. Hr really helpful with company employees. Lowes provides career opportunities through the store for employees to further on their career working for the company.
good,I liked always being busy but there was not a lot of workers to help out. So it was more busy and a lot of call ins everyday in every department so it was a little harder.
good,"Salary is somewhat competitive if you have years in. Don't look for high raises or management positions coming open to often."
good,I helped in opening a new store. I had great management and co- workers. Most of the customers were friendly.I prefer fixed shifts and the hours were always different and pay was low at the time.
good,"its an ok company to work for until they start cutting hours and then you have customers complaining that nobody is helping them meanwhile theres only about 5 people on the floor throughout the entire store, including managers .. The managers don't know how to put their foot down and actually abide by the policy they make customer service follow making the floor associates and customer service look like jerks because the manager lets the customers run away with murder."
good,"Interacting with customers, helping them find what they were looking for. Doing inventory and down stocking. Keeping the store clean. Learned that no matter how much experience or loyalty, didn't matter."
good,"friendly environment"
good,"the store I worked at; most the people were enjoyable to work with, got along great with my manager, due to under-staffing I would often have customers asking me questions specific to whatever department I would happen to be walking through that I couldn't answer"
good,"A basic day would be doing safety check, check for outs on the shelf bring pod. down if needed , make sure plants are watered , work freight on the floor and assist customers . unload trucks of soil .pavers or plants . Helping customers on computer and cashiering.        I learned about different products we sold az well as operating machinery such as forklift,reach and order picker.                               Management always helpful and supportive.                                            Culture is customer experience motivated.Corporate verses Mg goals often blur.                                                                                       The hardest part getting Mg task done verses corporate task as well as you own.                                                                                    The most enjoyable part was freedom to build create displays and making customers happy. Teaching and inspiring coworkers and   customers."
good,"working at lowes was very stressfull everyday, i learned a lot being there as a cashier, the management played favortisum there a lot and pick on certain cashiers there. The hardest part of my job there was running self check out  and stocking drinks and inventoiry too. was helping the customers out and training new cashiers."
good,"With 20 years of retail experience, I was sold on a culture with Lowe's that I have not experienced.  The pitch was that the company was focused on the development of the associates, yet the over complexity of the business offers little time for the management to sponsor development programs."
good,the work life is good but if you are a seasonal associate struggling to make ends meet it sucks when the cut you down to 14 hours a week other than tat not a bad place to work they look after their employees and make sure they have the backing they need to do their jobs.
good,Overall this job is good. All depends on what your job is. Even the lower paying jobs you can’t complain. You come in open boxes do some paper work and help customers. Your in the ac/ heater you get to socialize with co workers.
good,ultimately it was a decent place to work i had a pretty good experience there. the big box store came in with a new business model though and wiped me out.
good,"Good pay compared to other cashier type jobs. Our store had a habit of borderline criminal understaffing though, which led to many frustrating experiences. Lowes comes across as a ""customers first"" company (although shareholders first seems more accurate) which basically means customers can walk all over you, and they know it. Realistically though, I can't imagine it's much different from most other retail jobs. Seems like a concerted lack of effort though. Really no excuse for stores that make around a quarter billion a year."
good,"Speed, accuracy, and skill made this a fun job for me. Placement on a flatbed to stay under 13 foot was like putting a puzzle together and very challenging."
good,My role working at Lowe's was weekend work only. I enjoyed working at Lowe's but it interfered with my home life. I barely saw my family. The employees were great to work with.
good,good place to work part-time or for students. flexible hours and frindly staff. Service is great always fluctuated with customers situations and needs.
good,Lowes was a great and fun place to work. It gives you a lot of experience with home improvements. The qualifications of skills needed varies throughout the store.
good,"Lowes is a great company, however with the changes they made in management the stores have been struggling to succeed. Typically there is not enough associates on the floor anymore, and the few people who are on the floor have issues with trying to help out as much as they can."
good,The people at lowes that u work with are great people u make lot new friends and you help great customer find the products they need for there every day projects
good,I work as a front line cashier. Mornings are normally the busiest. The pay is decent and gives good hours. Only problem is a lot of the people I work with don't care about their job. It's a pain calling for a code 50 and no one responds and I'm left looking like a fool. I advise keeping a walkie on you when you need to call a loader.
good,I enjoy my job.  A few people seem to not like it but I genuinely like working for Lowe's.  The people who don't like it don't like to work.  There are times when it can be stressful but overall it isn't a bad place to work.  I often am confused as to why some people don't like working there.
good,The staff are amazing to work with. They laugh and have fun to enjoy themselves. The benefits are good. The customers are great though depending they can be tiring just like any customer service job.
good,Lowe's offers many different job opportunities and chances to advance with the company. The most enjoyable aspect of this job is helping people love where they live. It`s great to hear stories from customers with how Lowe`s helped them with their project and what they`re going to do with the materials they buy at Lowe`s. The hardest part about being a cashier is the same routine everyday and some of the complaints you get from customers for things that are beyond your control. This part of it just gets stressful and tiring.
good,"Working at Lowes was a good experience and taught a lot of life lessons. It was a fun place to work with a good environment. They offered great benefits on health, vision, and dental insurance a long with others"
good,We work with all types of customers to helping solve problems or create new living spaces for them. Lot of on hands learning from customers that are is same home improvement business. Management overall try to do good job but style of management is old school and not team based. Associates are lazy and try to get by with what they can. Customers are best part of the job wholesale and retail.
good,"Policies change with management change. No job security. Direct manager not supportive of employees. On the positive, good coworker relationships, teamwork is strong."
good,A typical day at work would be calm and relaxing during the morning. I Learned to stay to myself and focus on doing my job. Management was great but need work. Workplace culture was filled was weird. The hardest part of the job is seeing other employers true colors. The most enjoyable part of the job is gaining new friends who are trustworthy.
good,"I enjoyed my last position at Lowes as a store cashier.  I learned a new skill and I enjoyed interacting with customers, fellow cashiers and other store employees."
good,"Poor management team, great employees overall  though. If the management changed a bit it would be for the better. Overall it's a good experience and you can learn new things in your departments that can change how you view/what you know outside of the job."
good,As Salary you will work a minimum of 50 hours per week.  I am now required to work 6 days a week at 60 hours.   Very hectic work schedule with shifts that start at 5 am one day and end at midnight the next day.  No time for friends or family.
good,"I learned a lot working at Lowes. Simple things that I never thought was important when I was younger such as reading, and things such as the different materials we sell and how efficient they are to our daily lives and where we live. And how important it is to love where you live."
good,Typical day consist of working frieght and interacting with customers to help them locate products they need as well as doing loadouts of hevier items such as mulch for older customers.
good,Lowes is very multi cultural and and fun place to work. I worked both sales floor and warehouse. Sales floor is fun for an outgoing person and coworks
good,Company trying to change to many things about how business is done. Have been alienating it's employee focused mindset that was a core value. Restructuring of jobs has made advancement opportunities far and few between. Overall a good place to work. Just changing retail structure makes it hard for employees.
good,"Positives about Lowe's could easily be found in the social life of it. Co-Workers would always be there to help and teach you a different area if needed. Only downside is that management didn't really push for learning new areas. Biggest issue with management, If schooling was in the way they would not care, ""you applied to work not study."""
good,"Lowe's wants to be a leaner, more omni-channel-oriented company to satisfy traditional and e commerce customers. However, with all of the rapid change, change, and change, it seems that several older metrics are either overlooked, micromanaged, or not implemented correctly-stores changing, but vendors and corporate direction seems staid, unfocused and uninspired. Lowe's is playing perpetual catch-up to Home Depot, and it effects corporate judgment too often. Point-of-Sale software is Byzantine. Sterling e-commerce software not user friendly. Leadership lacking at critical junctures. store employees and support managers stretched too thin. Critical material to make our jobs easier deemed too expensive or taking too long to implement. Hiring new store associates, even for seasonal positions not timely. Lowe's seems to be in a flux, and seems unsure what they want to become."
good,"Good benefits. Hard schedules to work around with rotating days off and morning, mids, and nights are a must. A lot of hours put in for salaried management but good compensation at the end of the year if all monetary, margin, and district goals were met."
good,"Bumping heads with other associates. Some managers were to comfortable on getting away with things . The associates that put there hard work on the company were taken advantage of the work and the associates that would call out , be late and have bad  atittute and were best friends with managers and they get away with a lot"
good,"As a cashier, you are in constant interaction with customers as well as being required to perform a scripted way of talking with them at the register. You will be micromanaged a lot though by your head cashiers."
good,"I’ve gained a great deal of knowledge on the products that we sell at Lowe’s. I do appreciate the culture of what they’re about as a company, which is to help people love where they live. It does inspire me to one day own a home of my own."
good,a typical day at work would always go well. The employees were nice and a majority of the customers. I was in the paint department so it was always fun. You get to mix all different kinds of paint and its awesome to see how the colors are made. Everyone is very understanding there so when anyone would have a personal problem they all made sure you were okay.
good,"It was a good place to work in the retail environment, however you are on your feet for extended amount of time. The pay is ok but for the area not enough to live on."
good,"Would not recommend this company. Lack of direction on a great deal of operational processes. "
good,"-Cut off dead flowers and leaves"
good,"If you like dealing with customers on a daily basis its the job for you.If you want a management job at Lowes expect to do the  job of 3 people, since the restructure"
good,Management turnover is Lowe's biggest problem. The burn out factor is very high in all Management positions.Lack of quality employees in the market place at the rate of pay Lowe's offers will plague them forever.
good,"ive been at lowes for 8 months in 2 different positions, its a nice campus and the people are friendly and great. However I dont think i have seen one person stay in the same position in my time there and there is no moving up the ranks there."
good,"I worked hard and did so much more than what was required of me for this company. I poured myself into my customers and my work and I always went above and beyond for my job. I was in a terrible car accident that left me unable to go to work for a week and I pushed myself to get back to work as soon as I did. I trusted the company that Lowe's works with to make sure that I could have those absences due to the accident excused, everyone assured me that it would all be taken care of until two days before my benefits and vacation time renewed, I was terminated and treated like a criminal at a place that I had so diligently poured myself into for a year."
good,"My shift started at 7am. We loaded and routed the trucks, and where on the road by 8am. The in-store  culture was bases on favoritism not accomplishment or work ethic."
good,once you are used to the routine it is fairly fixed.  variance in seasonal fluxes in freight can lead to an excess or shortage of hours but management will work with you.
good,I enjoyed my time working at Lowe's and only left to pursue a professional career in a field that was more personally interesting. Managers are good people that care about their employees.
good,"due to corporate greed across the nation, pay rate hovers around minimum wage and hits the peak around $16-$17 per hour (2018). And you only get raises in increments, so it could take years just to get to $15 lol"
good,"I like working for this company. They are fairly flexible with my school schedule. I work in the back, therefore it is pretty laid back. The people on the floor are often overworked and under extreme stress and pressure, most notably the sales specialists. I wish it paid more (that being said, it does pay more than most retail), but I do get quite a lot of paid time off for working part time. The management at my particular store is pretty good."
good,A typical day would be stocking product from the back inventory as well as grabbing what wasn't on the floor for customer requests. You can get trained for forklifts and order pickers which can be at times demanding because of the shortage of staff who were trained on it. I learned to do inventory checks as well as place orders. The workplace culture was relatively more for an older audience.
good,"At my time working at Lowes, I somewhat enjoyed it but it wasn't something I was willing to do long term. Money was very good and people were nice so there is no shame in working there. The environment wasn't for me necessarily though."
good,"Outsiders/New Hires have a hard time ever fitting in with the long term employees of 5 or more years. Will always be treated as outsider, always talking about you behind your back."
good,"pretty cool pace to work. not somewhere that I would build a career, but somewhere great to work. would recommend this job to just about anyone. good pay too"
good,A big company with a lot going on.  The building does get hot in the summertime and gets cold in the wintertime.  The culture is great to be a part of.
good,"I took the job at Lowe's as my ""semi retirement"" job.  I helped raise my twin grandsons and the work schedule fit in well with my personal life."
good,Was a good place to work but they expected a lot for what they were paying and the yearly raise increase wasn't enough for me. Management shifts as well as seemingly missing managers was a bit difficult to work with.
good,"I loved my job at Lowes. I had a great manager that taught me a lot. it was the employees and HR that made things difficult. To much he said she said, Not enough working together to get the job done."
good,"After 16 years there is no trust left in the company and job security is a myth. The good part is that each store is unique. The stores try to make it as good as they can for the associates but in retail there is always that ""favortisim"" from some of the managers"
good,"Management was lazy and didn't care about their employees, nor wanting to be helpful."
good,Lowe's is a good place if you want to move up in the company. If you are willing to put in the work and give it your all they will notice and reward you for it.
good,Started in 2011 loved working there. Left in 2017 after a corporate restructure tore the fun out of the job. The new way of doing business rewarded the best people in the building with the opportunity to re-apply for new positions or take drastic cuts in pay or leave.
good,"It was a different experience, although I did learn a lot about customer service, it just wasn't where I wanted to be in the future with my career, so I decided to try something else."
good,Good place to work if your not seasonal or part time to get full time  work here you have to know someone at this location this is what i notice while working here
good,"My first few years with the company I really enjoyed but the store is changing in a lot of ways that negatively impact employees. Many layoffs, less bonuses, fewer opportunities for advancement. Also you can only receive tuition reimbursement if you are a full time employee but you can't be a full time employee with out open availability. You can not be a student and work full time, so really there is no tuition reimbursement unless you can get your entire degree online. The pay is pretty good compared to most other retail jobs if you have prior experience and especially if you have a college degree."
good,I would rather not talk about what occurred during my time there because things were done unfairly to me and other associates. Some may read this and may not want apply there so enough said.
good,"Overall I liked working here I just want better pay coworkers are nice, I would recommend this job to one of my friends who need a job.................."
good,"Quit pace, some good days some bad days, some management is ok to work with. You get two 15 minutes break 30 minutes for lunch. You have to work hard."
good,"The people you work with 40+ hours a week become family! I have been with the company for 10+ years and these people I manage have become a staple of who I have become over the years. I have managed to make friends for life. The job is stressful due to staffing cuts and the increase to make increased numbers and sales goals with less assocaites takes a toll on any seasoned employee. Especially when the idea was to hire more part time and cut full time positions. This in turn led to a mass increase of people who do not care as much as the much needed full time associates who were dedicated to making the place run as smooth as possible. This led to a incredible amount of stress on the SSM and ASM positions (Myself included in the SSM role) Upper store management refuses to hold people acccountable for their actions and leads to recurring nightmares with the same problems, day in and day out. I am now seeking new employment due to these concerns as I am fed up with the way the company is looking to save a buck."
good,I suppose it would have been fine if I liked to waste my day helping people with things that they don't need. Also working with people who have no other possible future is a total drag.
good,Felt like a good company to work for. Always chasing Home Depot for sales and policies. Executives trying new things to restructure company for profit. Every 5 years or say announce massive layoffs that affect thousands.
good,I started as a part time employee. Applied numerous times for full time positions for months. Talked with managers about advancement and hours. Never received any. Advised them that I was gonna start looking for a full time job and changed my eligibility to only weekends before I found one. First week into new job they started scheduling me for 4 days during the week. Unable to show up because of my new job they considered me a no call/ no show hereby terminating me even though I had changed my eligibility prior to searching for said new job. I enjoyed working there and assisting to customers. Had customers that would specifically ask for me when visiting the store.
good,"I do not have a lot to say about lowes at this time,to much drama and confusion everytime I go ther I feel as though no one is will to help me with my purchase..."
good,I've been with Lowe's for over 11 yrs off and on. I left to deliver hospital equipment for another company for a year and that became dangerous. Lowe's took me back as the position I previously left as which was a department manager. I did the department manager role for 5+ years and it got old. The expectations and the hassles you deal wasn't worth it to me. The money is good not great but good. You're juggling your associates and customers then also dealing with breakdowns in coverage because people don't like to work or show up for that matter. Outside of that the benefits are good and as a company they've helped me out so much outside of my worklife. So it's a bittersweet situation with them and I won't say it's not a good company to work for just letting others know the role they will sign up for if they decide to move up. You can always transfer and it is a family type of atmosphere with my fellow coworkers. I had to step down due to the stress however I'm grateful for this company's existence.
good,The workplace culture at Lowe's has become more difficult in the last year as Lowe's has eliminated management positions in order to stay competitive in the home improvement sector
good,If you can land a full time job at Lowe's I'm sure it's a great experience. I just can't make it on 800 dollars a month. The management is tossed around by corporate as they please. I've seen managers become sales associates and specialists and make less because corporate decides to change the structure.
good,"I recommend to any friend to experience working for them, very friendly and collaborative environment. "
good,"My experience at Lowes, albeit short, was still memorable. The company itself is cool to work for, but there isn't much structure or direction to what you'll be doing as a sales floor representative, from my experience. My only real problem was with the management, but this is a store-by-store basis."
good,Typical work day. Easy to deal with. Chances of growth very slim. Management are likely to be hired from outside rather than promoted from within. Would work for them again
good,A typical day at work for me was unloading trucks. I learned how to work as a group. The management was great. The workplace culture was diverse. The hardest part of the job was lifting certain things at times. The most enjoyable part of my job was working as a team and getting the job done.
good,Can not get job done in time alotted because of not enough employees. To many part timers. This is bad for customer service! Shelves are empty even though products are available.
good,It's a fast paced work environment and a lot of customer interaction. You are standing in one place most of the time. If you have the drive there is a lot of opportunity for advancement.
good,"As a Lowes cashier I get to interact with the customers, help answer there questions. I ring up all the merchandise as quick and accurately as possible. Our managers are always  on hand to help us with any issues we may have. Hardest part of the job is making sure that our customers have had an enjoyable and satisfying shopping experience at Lowes. My Co- workers and I are all team players, we enjoy interacting with the customers and helping them find what they need. The most important part of my day is when a customer has traveled a long distance, the other stores they have gone to have not been helpful. They came to our store someone helped them find the product. This happens quite often, lowes does provide the personal service customers deserve."
good,Lowes is a very high stressed and pasted job. They are going thru a employee structural change so all jobs are changing...looks like if  you like a part time job this is the one for you
good,"I loved working there for what my job title was,it just that it was putting too many miles on my car.if this j9b was closer to where i live,i would still be working there."
good,Great company to work for if you have a good management team. Communication is a must in order to create a stress free environment. Favoritism should not exist in order to be fair to everyone.
good,"Learned operations of several different departments, certified in all power equipment available in store. Familiarized with shipping, receiving, rtm's and hazmat regulations. Etc...."
good,"Lowe's pays well for a retail employer.  The down-side is the random work hours - required to be available for all three shifts, weekends and holidays."
good,"Lowe's offers many different positions in the home improvement retail field. It provides an opportunity to help people in a time of need, for repairs. The hardest part with Lowe's is the work schedule. there only a few jobs with regular hours Monday thru Friday. All other positions have flexible scheduling any where from 6 AM to 10 PM, 7 days a week."
good,good company hard to move up and some times show favoritism on veteran employees they have great benefits and they also have a good starting pay or salary.
good,good place for the most part. you had to be a golden child to ever be considered a promotion. i was literally told by my ops manager (wish it was recorded) that he was point blank going to promote me to supervisor. never happened. i left on good terms though and still have many lowes friends i speak to
good,"I really liked the working for my last employer,, they are a good company and take care of their employees.Indeed it was a shame I couldn't get a transfer."
good,I worked for Lowes for a long time. I did max my pay rate. For some Lowe's is a great place and for others it isn't a good fit. The management team plays a big role in the store environment. Some stores have a great management team while others not so great.
good,I enjoyed the customers. I worked with friendly work team and good managers. They ran out of volume of customers and didn't need as many of us on the front end.
good,"The best thing i enjoyed at lowe's, I would have to say was the employees. We worked as a family, we all communicated well and helped each other when we could."
good,"The managers are great, in that, they will work with you on personal issues as long as advance notice is given. The hardest part of the job is rotating schedule and rotating workdays."
good,"An overall good place to work, with few opportunities for advancement without moving, constant lack of caring by employees when they work. Fair pay to begin but a slow raise rate"
good,Lowes is a good place to work. The benefits are excellant. There is always a chance for advancement if you apply yourself. Good atmosphere to work in.
good,"Typical day"
good,The managers at Lowes were very understanding and they worked well with others. Whenever I had a question or needed help with something she was always there by my side to help and she stayed by my side until I got it.
good,Poor management. But I think it was more of the location than the company. Some managers played favorites. They picked and chose who they wanted to train and help and who they didn't.
good,"Higher Management was always a bit on the finicky side, not terrible for a big company, there were a few biases being on the overnight stocking team.."
good,"Giving a 100% cutomer service, definitely must be fast paced. Handling online orders, do returns & exchanges and handling customers disputes. Must be people friendly & be very energeic"
good,"Since reorganizing, restructuring and eliminating Dept Manager and ASM positions. Is frustrating for employees with time management on task and most importantly leaves the customer disappointed at times with their shopping experience. "
good,Decent place to work if you're in school and need the money. Long hours and no fixed schedule makes it hard to have a life outside of work. People and customers are nice to work with.
good,Many changes have come with the company restructure. Not all have been beneficial to the employee. Job security has become a concern. Service manager position does the same work as Assistant Store Managers for much less pay.
good,If you like working retail then Lowe's is a good place to work. There is opportunity of advancement and they do it fairly.  I really liked my manager.  You get to know the people in your community and I really enjoyed that.  If there was down time and you wanted something to do they would always find something for you.  If you needed more hours they were always willing to give them to you if possible. I personally enjoyed working in lawn and garden because it was outside and really nice during the spring and summer.
good,"I like working for Lowe's,but I have been at customer service desk for  several years,with no opportunity for advancement,I just need a career change from the burnout."
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work, Lowe's gives opportunities to people who desire to grow in Lowe's and make a career out of it. Great opportunities of moving around to each departments."
good,Employees and managers were very helpful and welcoming into the Lowe's team. Flexible scheduling and benefits we're available. Only downside is that management is too lenient on employees who constantly call out or do no shows.
good,Lowes is a very nice place to work and have awesome benefits. They offer everything from 401k to stock buying options. The work isn't too hard but can be stressful due to no coverage in departments.
good,"Only thing you have to worry about is Customer Complaints. Even the best worker can get a random person who never entered the store to make a complaint with corporate, which costs someone their job. That's the only bad part since you can't make everyone happy and we live in a world full of pranksters."
good,"Fast paced, stressful, competitive work environment."
good,"I choose not to rate this employer at this time do still wanting to keep my job . Very confident in the company for now thanks for asking ,nothing is a sure thing"
good,Lowes was a fun experience management was great business was great but the hours and lack of family life caught up to me and I didn't have enough family time for the weekends for my kids.
good,they do let you learn a lot but there are some issues with certain management in the volusia area. the upper management dist and up are always there to help you and believe without you they would not of a business.
good,New challenges New faces great people friendly environment welcoming atmosphere learn something everyday help customers love where they live a sense of  belonging
good,"its a productive work area"
good,"Company cut commission after I transfer into a much higher cost area with very little compensation.  If I hadn't relocated with the understanding that I would making $20,000 more an year in commission and end up with zero I would have felt better.  Although this did talk place Corporate wide not just with me."
good,"I have been a human resources coordinator with Lowe's from the last few months. Great company to work for, but pay and advancement are areas the company needs to work on."
good,It is fast paced and definitely keeps you busy 90% of the time. You'll see alot of the same customers so it's a plus to bond and build relationships with them.
good,"I am in charge of all cashiers and equipment. I have to schedule breaks and lunches, call in employees when we have call outs, help with customer issues, keep customer flow up. Help with other departments, keep carts in, train new employees."
good,"Employees that work with a family spirit."
good,customer service focus great people to work with. teamwork focus laid back try to make store look like it is brand new..........................................
good,"In the area I worked, nobody really checked on you. You were left to do your job and anything else to occupy yourself till your shift ended. I was in charge of when I went on break, I could decide when I go to lunch or needed a 15 minute break. The job I filled there was relaxing, could take my time and not rush. Overall a great experience to put under my belt."
good,"I loved working for Lowes, great atmosphere of people, working with customers on my delivery route and helping them achieve what they needed in their home"
good,"I used to take pride in how well Lowe's took care of it's employees. Now with recent changes, the focus has gone away from taking care of employees to entirely focused on shareholder payout."
good,"The pay is great for a retail job, but it's like being back in high school. The bad part is the management participates in the drama as well. It can be rather stressful because of the drama. That being said the people who do not take part in the drama are amazing people, they look out for you ... if you can get in the right circle."
good,This is a good company to work for. The other associates are fantastic to work with. I have enjoyed my time with lowes. I wish they would offer more money at time of reviews.
good,"Good place to work learned a lot working there. Really busy during the summer. Very laid back, and you're not micro managed. There is room to grow in the company"
good,"Promised full time, only got part time. They don't keep their word. They don't deal with work place bullies. I love almost all my co  workers but the way they are changing the company you can't make lowes a Career. I wanted a full time  position that I could work in for at least another fifteen years. They don't show any appreciation for loyalty and quality. I  get customer and coworkers compliments. What do I have  to show for it low hours."
good,"to many changes going on no one knows what to do. There are more changes coming and associates are not feeling secure in their jobs, which kills engagement."
good,"Lowes as a company emphasized servant leadership to support the overall direction of the company. It embraced fair and consistent values to engage employees; however, due to structural changes in leadership , it became increasingly difficult to achieve sustainable results due to the lack of talent and turnover in stores"
good,"This company is very focused towards pleasing customers, (also Making Sales).  The management team was very kind and all that was expected, is that every employee focused on Safety and Customer Satisfaction."
good,"over all, lowes gave me the opportunity to learn about the computerized world of designing a kitchen with no prior experience. "
good,I worked in the paint department .  The people were friendly  and the manager was great . The work life balance was  good and there are a lot of fun team building activities
good,"Not a good  work environment at times,too much employee complaining. Management changes frequently.Pros of working at Lowe's is I enjoyed helping customers and enjoyed my job."
good,Managment needs a lot of work. all thay like is what money is going in there pocet and not the one that work there to help them get a chack. people that know what thay are doing get over looked and one that have just been there a short time get managment job over them and dont know what they are doning .
good,"Once you learned what things you could and should be doing, the job was largely keeping yourself busy in between specific requests or tasks from customers or managers. However, the quick pace made it frustratingly easy to trip up when taking on unfamiliar responsibilities, which made it difficult to develop your skill-set and experience. Most assistance and advice came from co-workers, who in general were pleasant to work with."
good,"Lowe's was a decent company to work for. I did enjoy it until the restructure was done. Now the work load is overbearing and unrealistic. Most people are leaving the company, I think its because they haven't hired enough people for this restructure to actually work. Im sure it will be better by 2018. The worst part is way the customers treat you here. They treat you like your not an actual human being who is trying to do their best given the expectations and stress, and the lack of people to really help everyone. I would constantly get yelled and screamed at by customers do to other actions or unforeseeable circumstances that work directly effected by me. Ive been called horrible names for no reason. So many that I couldn't even list them all off if I tried, and I have always been a nice and courteous associate. The company truly just has way to many things going on to offer and not enough people and training to get them to all run smoothly, from installing just about anything you can have installed, flooring, appliances, bathroom vanities, light fixtures and all the way to windows doors and full kitchen and bathroom remodels, that are all completely outsourced or partnered with other companies, then our own delivery team. Its alot. And the systems are so old they are still a dos system and practicly impossible to ever have working properly. Everything is glitch and always freezes up.  "
good,Being that it was my first time working at a Lowe's. They do not teach you anything dealing with your job. They throw you out on your own and expect you to learn it. They also have no organization. your basically on your own.
good,"Working here is not to bad. They have good benefits. Each store is different with management. Some are good. Some are bad. But as a company, good. Good time off, 401k match. Good hourly, lots of customer service. Each department has different responsibilities, more or less of the same things. Follow up, customer service, product knowledge."
good,Change is inevitable but Lowes is always changing. Stressfu way to live sometimes. Sometimes change is just too much. Have to be flexible and handle stress well.
good,"It's common for one person to cover a whole department, sometimes one person had to handle multiple departments. The compensation for the amount of work expected from the workers is not balanced"
good,My time at lowes was a  interesting experience. Lowes has a great clientele and there customer's are amazing. In my time at Lowe's i reviewed and felt there management skills need to be improved by conecting and conversating with they're employees.
good,"Very much enjoyed the people I worked with over the years, and was given many growth opportunities and chances to learn. It's ever evolving and provides internally what many have to seek externally."
good,ot is not at all hard to get a job at the Lowe's foods I worked at. The take in new employees on a regular basis whether they have experience or not. So if you need a job quick try Lowe's Foods.
good,Lowes is a perfect place to work if you are looking for a fill in job. But if you have no desire to move up don't expect much in compensation. Good benefits for full time employees but not so much for part timers.
good,"Overall working at Lowe's is positive. The company's values are very well intentioned.  Once you reach a salaried level, your work/home life balance becomes very skewed toward work, especially during the Spring and Summer.   The job can vary depending on the management team within the building.   If there are concerns though, Lowe's gives you many avenues to be heard outside of the building."
good,"Loved everything about the job. It was the manager that was the con. Everyone there was great but there was one manager that didn't like me because I was friend with a kid he was ""mentoring"" without even knowing me he judged me and ultimately tricked me into thinking I got fired. Until acouple months later I found out I was a no call no show"
good,"Typically your day consists of front facing and cleaning your area. It does get busy from 2-5 on week days. You will learn a lot on the job so do not be overcomes with the many questions asked by  customers. The store manager seems to just sit in his room and have his ear ringed off by upper management and does nothing else. ASMs within the store tend to follow each other around. Employees are very nice and friendly so they provide a good  balanced working environment. When it does get busy and you have people waiting for you do not stress out, take your time because you can only work so fast. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get a customer who actually listens to you and asks questions because that is the only way you can help them. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who want the best product but also want it at the cheapest price which is unreasonable."
good,"Loading trucks with products that range from packs of light bulbs to air conditioners, there was a cafeteria that cooked fresh food for employees to purchase."
good,"While I have only been working at Lowe's for one year, that year was a year in which I learned more than I ever have on any  job.  There are multiple departments in the store in which one has the opportunity to envelop ones self in a vast array of product information and skills. Management as well as staff are always  professional, and morale is always at a high.  During the day, there is always something to do, and never a moment in which one is simply standing around. Going to work every day and getting the opportunity to meet new people never grows old with Lowe's Home-Improvement."
good,Very fast paced environment were multiple multi tasking is a must the hardest part of your day is handling a register while also handling phone calls .
good,I worked there for close to 3 years it was my first official job working many positions and working my way up the ladder.A Good place to get into the world of home improvement because you will learn alot.
good,"Something different to do almost every day, but the recent layoffs lowered morale.  Folks were let go for efficiency reasons, with no fault of theirs."
good,"I worked as an exceptional employee for 9 years never missed a day of work and they canned me, saying they wanted to reorganize, however they kept some of the employees that had HR issues and wasn't as productive so hard work doesn't pay off with this company, they do not even look at your PDP or work ethics they look at how much money they can save and the numbers at the end of year."
good,"I've worked on a couple stores and the difference is from here to the moon, overall the company is great as long your in a good location. Pay is decent"
good,"It was a very clean, positive enviroment to work in, coworkers were excellent, the hours were terrible though, and the turn over there for the short time i was employed was terrible. they cut off alot of peoples hours who had been there 2+ years, and when i offed my 2 weeks, the management were fairly rude and would not take my offer. they proclaimed that i was a walk out, which i was not. i was a seasonal employee and they had told us it was okay if we had found new jobs. extremely disappointed in the negative action, overall it was a great work enviroment"
good,"The Human Resources manager was a complete joke, end of story. Management itself needed training. They weren't to keen on working with peoples schedules."
good,I was completely blindsided when I was laid off and there was no real reason for letting me go when they are actually trying to build and be more data driven. The business intelligence team is great but overall leadership needs a huge overhaul.
good,I worked for this company for almost three years and they do not value there employees. I went to work never called off and did my job while I was there.
good,I enjoyed my short time there but jump on an chance that did not work out.  The constant changing of shifts made its hard to plan events and holidays.
good,"Moved stores toward East and South."
good,Scheduling is off most of the time. They are not good at managing peak hours verses non-peak hours. This leads to having too many employees at times they don't need them. In the evenings they don't have enough employees which leads to the lost of customers due to poor customer service.
good,I would come into work and stock the shelves with the merchandise that came off the truck and then I would help in any department that would need help sometimes I would have to work weekends
good,"Good place to learn sales, order management , power equipment , time management and how to deal with problems and think quick on your feet to find a solutions for probkems people had."
good,Good entry level or post retirement environment in which to advance.  Hours can be demanding but advancement is available.  Need to be able to multi task.
good,"I stock the freight that comes in on the delivery trucks, and put any remaining in topstock. I use equipment such as forklifts and power stockers to get and put away product into and out of topstock. "
good,Hard for advancement tried several times to move up when a position became available within our store location. Never got a clear answer to why I couldn't get the position.
good,"Great Customer Service "
good,One of the best things about working at Lowe's is the environment and the employees.I looked forward to going to work knowing that I was going to be surrounded by people who were willing to help me and encourage me.
good,Lowes as a company has continued to provide a lot of benefits to its employees. Bonuses and job opportunities are some of those perks. Recent changes to the structure of the company has made it seem like a not stable environment for its management.
good,"I worked for the company for three years and had received three promotions, but due to company restructuring, my position was eliminated and I was let go.  I really enjoyed working for the company and was committed to their purpose, but this situation has left me frustrated!"
good,"The organization is undergoing strategic shifts.  What I leave behind is not relevant to what you may experience.  "
good,"Depending on the department where you work, the job can be good or It can be an absolute disaster. For the most part, the physical work is easy and there's not too much to remember because everything is pretty simple and easy to remember. Most of the managers here are garbage and abuse their powers for the wrong reasons. Overall, the associates are pretty cool and the work place is very diverse and friendly. Obviously, it's retail, so you will get some customers that will try and ruin your day-but don't let them get to you. This job is good and it's pretty easy to move around to different departments."
good,"Hours will vary depending on the season, If you work outside cashiering in the fall and winter , you have a shack but it still gets very cold.  Hardest part of this job is moving up. Most enjoyable part is making a customer happy and see them smile."
good,they completely changed the culture of the store for customers and associates.  your daily tasks always change everyday but that's what's good about the job.
good,"It was a place to work to earn money to go towards my college tutition. I learned a little bit about myself when working at Lowes. I got to improve upon my communication skills with people and developed relationships with my co workers. Management was alright for the area the store is located, they did their part to lead and run an efficient retail store. At times it was hectic, having to constantly run around the large store looking for a product for a customer and after that lift twenty 60 lbs bags right afterwards. Loved talking to customers and listening to their stories; helping them with their shopping endeavors was fulfilling."
good,Corporate has no idea what is actually going on at the store level.  Store appearance isn't the most important thing.  Most employees thing the new culture is a joke
good,"It was a good job to start out with, but oportunity to advance was not there.  Compensation was not good at all, raises never helped unless you were able to get into different positions."
good,"It is a good place to work at , not enough hours and when you are a cashier and work nights they sometimes make you clean the restrooms."
good,"I moved around a lot with this company, that was very enjoyable because I was constantly learning new and exciting things. Making bonuses was always a plus as well"
good,"Good company that works with you, typical day consists of helping customers and keeping up with your department in the store, whether it is electrical, plumbing, etc."
good,Nice place to work good benefits but they do not give good raises. Most managers have been great there are a few not so good.
good,"typical day or night is stocking, cleaning, making bales, doing resets and setting up holiday displays"
good,"This job will keep you hopping! You have every chance to learn, should your own volition lead you to such an endeavor. Giving more of yourself is the key to staying."
good,"Being department manager of Plumbing had very unique challenges.  It was often the busiest department as we provided solutions to repair faulty plumbing, where other departments would be selling new tools, flooring, and building materials."
good,While Lowe's has paid me fairly for my long service I am still amazed as to the disconnect the upper management at corporate has at the store level. The store is the back bone of the company and generates all the profits. Unfortunately we often feel the store is the last to be considered when changes are implemented. Technology at the store level is buggy and unreliable. I feel the company is at least 10 years behind other businesses and attempts to jump forward rather than invest inclemently as it should have. As a result we often lack the tools we need to be effective. Management is not effective at hiring quality employees in my area. In addition management has difficulty communicating with each other which cause confusion at the lower levels of the store. Every year the hourly managers are told that they will be supplied with quality employees at the needed levels but as usual the senior management hires staff that are not mentally or physically suited to the job. As a result they tend to threaten the hourly management with the usual accountability verbiage when productivity suffers. In a nutshell I feel as though Lowe's is two companies. One that is customer focused and one that is operational focused. They both have not figured out how to coexist and work against each other.
good,co workers were very friendly and always ready to help. Management very nice and well educated. There were always things to do. Flexible work schedule.
good,"Manual labor with odd hours (especially around the holidays), low job-security, and pushy sales.  The people you work with are great, the actual work was fun; the corporate policy was more intrusive and less desirable--perhaps making our jobs in the aisles harder to perform."
good,I take care of all incoming/out going trucks.  I deal with all inventory or truck issues at arise. Me and a small team load and unload trucks and we verity the shipment to lowes standards.
good,"The company is decent, management was awesome. The only reason I quit this job was because I have high risk pregnancies. The company isn't bad for first time employees."
good,"A typical day at Lowes would be to complete the Daily Safety Hazard Review and then fill any empty spots on the shelf.  Then the next step would be to put away all the freight from that morning.  Then we would of course take care of the customers needs, answer their questions and then help load their purchases if need be.  I learned time management, and to prioritize my tasks better."
good,"The pay was good, but the hours were not.  I had smaller kids and I could not get onto another shift unless there was an opening.  They also would not work with me as far as returning to school."
good,"Decent place to work. Co-workers are great, I started knowing nothing about plumbing but was trained and have become one of the most knowledgeable in our department. Management leaves something to be desired. HR and Store Manager constantly hire from outside the store making it near impossible to move up where you are. Overall the benefits are decent and the work isn't back breaking so if you like helping people but don't mind being overlooked for promotions this is your dream job."
good,Co-workers are great. Some problems with upper management (inside the current store I am located) not appreciating the employees hard work. Overall this is a good place to work.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me greeting and ringing up customers items. As well as stocking drinks and snacks. I learned that working together and helping each other is a must. Teamwork is essential in the workplace, no matter differences between coworkers. The management was very unprofessional. Getting entirely too friendly with coworkers, favoring coworkers, and using their positions to their advantage. Some of my coworkers were immature, some had no knowledge of the department they were in, some brought outside issues into the workplace and there were a few who could not be better fit for their positions. The hardest part of my job was watching management take their position as a joke and taking full advantage of their job title. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to brighten peoples day and in trying to help the customers, I ended up learning new things I did not know prior to working at Lowe's."
good,As a new call center Lowe's has experienced a 'runaway' train affect on the call center floor.  Great to work for but they need stronger direction from the General Managers that is consistent.
good,"A typical day at work , fast paced customer enacting duties which heightened my awareness of many do it yourself processes, that customers were all to eager to share. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain in stock ,while giving every customer excellent service. The most enjoyable sharing in overall employees experiences, to compare for future successes."
good,"Great environment, happy people. Always a motivated environment and fun events scheduled from time to time. Hardest part of the job may be moving heavy applianced when low on staff or help."
good,"Now don't get me wrong, I love working for Lowe's. The people there are very friendly and easy to work with on most days. The only thing that I myself have a problem with is trying to move up in the company. They say that there are areas of opportunities to move up in that company, but I guess it is only for ""certain people"". I don't think that It is fair that hard working people like myself are not given the chance."
good,"Unfortunately the staff is just part of it, some are very helpful while others aren't team players.  Very difficult to run a store when there aren't enough associates.  The store isn't that organized and it looks bad to our customers.  Overall enjoy the store, but wish the issues could be resolved to make a better working environment to the staff and customers."
good,There's no shortage of good workers there but the culture is hard to handle. From the constant struggle to move to the hard enviro ft it's a grind but if you can tough it out it's a fun place.
good,"Wish i could have had better management. Loved my co workers and flexible work schedule. Moved up quickly, and always had good workers i managed. Would go back."
good,"Generally I had a great time at Lowes. But that was because of my co-workers. Management doesn't care about the individual. You can request off and you'll rarely ever get it. If you have a complaint they try to brush you off and ignore it. And there's no guarantee of when you'll be allowed to leave. Regardless of what your time slot says."
good,"Nice place to work at, management left foot doesn't know what it's right foot is doing causing conflicts. Other than that co workers are very friendly."
good,"The atmosphere and culture are friendly.  Conscientious attention to detail is rewarded with secure employment."
good,"As a bagger at Lowe's Signature Market it was overall a great experience. Although co-workers could be a hassle, most of the time I got along. Cleaning bathrooms once or twice a day depending on the shift, pushing carts constantly, bagging for customers and making sure that there experience was great in the store is just an average day at Lowe's. While working there I stocked, and helped out with produce as I gained more experience but my title stayed as bagger. Advancement in that company takes a great deal of time and hard work. My schedule mostly included closing the store as I did on occasion open. I was dependable, hard working, and open to any criticism that anyone might have on my work as that is a very important skill to have (communication with co-workers and customers alike)."
good,"A typical day at work would start with stocking or doing the DSHR (Daily Safety and Hazmat Review). Then from there we were ""suppose to help customers"". The reason I put it """" is because, some departments would do this and some would not. The DM (Department Managers) would be to focused on stocking and telling people to stock that the customers would be completely ignored. As far as management go is concerned they are fantastic. The open door policy is truly open door. They will always listen to what you have to say and listen to your side of things. Whether that be with reorganizing a department or an argument you and co-worker had. The hardest part of the job was the scheduling. Once the schedule had dropped the DM (Department Managers) could change what day, or what time you came in on a certain week of the schedule. They would usually do this without asking you."
good,"Good work environment, loved the people. Low paying job but not a whole lot to complain about. "
good,lowe's isn't a bad place to work but there are a lot of unmotivated associates that don't want to work making customer service terrible and everyone elses job harder
good,"Typically a tough day at work, but helping people is rewarding."
good,"Make it to work and many days are busy. The most difficult part of the job is having to deal with customers that are aggravated for reasons that are beyond my control and trying to satisfy these customers who seem to be completely unable to satisfy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with. I enjoy the company that I am around while I am there, they give support and are great to conversate with. The management does a good job, however there is always room for improvement. I feel I've learned all I can for the job I have. I've learned a lot about retail transactions and customer service and how I could make myself better than I did without this experience."
good,lowes is a good place to work at and the people there for the most part are friendly when i was working at lowes. the management was good. a typical day at lowes was easy for the most part. my co workers were nice when i worked there.
good,"The fellow employees make this job a fun place to work.  This is just straight up customer service all day.  It is rewarding to be able help people with their home projects.  The schedule is rough.  The hours are not consistant.  Lowe's doesnt offer alot of full time positions.  Upper management work 50+hours a week (and are on salary).  Other than the few cons,  there are alot of pros."
good,"As a part-time college student, working hours were plentiful."
good,Fellow employees are very nice and the store is very well kept. Management is mediocre but once you get past it then the job is pretty fun.
good,"Provide exceptional customer relationships, maximize sales by building relationships with clients at all stages of sales, installations, create estimates, negotiate cost to create outstanding value for clients. identify and resolve complex customer issues, order management, access computers for communication, information and sales. data entry pricing, product merchandising , maintenance and displays. use handheld devices such as mobile phones paging systems palm pilot , copy and fax machine E mail LRT gun. Utilize machinery , fork lift, narrow reach truck pallet jack, electrical lift, Order reach Truck."
good,"Participative management professional; results driven, highly motivated, organized professional with dynamic experience in the areas of sales & marketing, customer management, operations and business development.  Proven capability of initiating, managing, and augmenting value-based relationships that drive profits and maximize customer retention.  Demonstrated ability to think strategically and creatively in a manner that actively affects diverse levels of an organization, internally and externally.  Articulate, productive, goal-oriented leader with exceptional customer management skills leveraged with a solid work ethic.  Ability to create and implement strategic marketing plans to achieve maximum market penetration."
good,"Lowe's is big on safety,for both the customer and employee, each morning the associates are required to do a safety walk.  After that we are to down stock and work on zone recovery."
good,A typical customer service retail job. Worked in several different departments. Management is available for positive and constructive feedback.
good,"Great place to work."
good,Lowes is a new contact center and is going through growing pains. Management is not skilled in the company. There is 87% turn over and this is because the hours are hard and long and you are constantly on the phone.
good,You could keep busy but alot of the customers that come in aren't the nicest people in the world and some times neither is management.
good,This is a rural store and doesn't get the business like the larger locations. Co-workers are dedicated to customers. The place is an enjoyable work place if you are part time. The full time folks seem to appreciate the company.
good,when I first started with Lowes they truly cared about the customer and the employee. When the founders started to retire and the new crew took over it was a lot more about the dollar and less about the customer
good,"There is a lot of sites to go on in order for us have a successful phone call, I learned that there is a lot to do in a call center. The hardest part is remembering all the steps to take to complete call."
good,Interact with customer daily and help them find products they need and recommend things they can use. Setup and arrange the department for ease of product selection.  Stock the shelves and maintain department appearance.  I learned that working a retail job is something everyone should have to experience.  My co-workers at Lowe's are generally good people I enjoy working with.  The hardest part of the job is constant walking on concrete floors.
good,"As a cashier we do not only ring up customers or assist them in customer service; we do multiple task. For example a typical day would depend on the shift, either I'm at customer service or in the front end ringing up customer and make sure my area is clean. I love my fellow coworkers they are great individuals with different personalities. The hardest part of the job is dealing with lack of hours as a part timer. This job is not a security because you can be fired at a drop of a hat. What I enjoy about my job is helping the needy rebuild there homes and have holiday parties sometimes."
good,I loved designing semi-custom cabinets for potential customers. I exceeded all of my sales goals for every month i worked. I did not like that the store did not show a real vision for the staff.
good,"fun workplace for a part time job. pay is good, enjoyable for people who do a lot of diy projects etc. Management is good for the most part, however some expect you to check your schedule daily for changes. This is not only annoying but seems seems contradictory to the fact they create schedules 2 weeks ahead of time."
good,I would go up to my supervisors and ask them what needs to be done. I would be put on self checkout or at a regular register. They are flexible with you.
good,"A typical day at work is always staying busy. From completing paper work, down stocking and providing customer service is always fun. I have been in management for almost 3 years now."
good,"A typical day for me would be to clock in, check my emails and walk the areas that belong to me. I would do a safety check upon arrival, and verify completion of the tasks that were sent to my employees the day prior. At that point I would get with my Store Manager and see if he had a plan for the day. If not I would walk my areas again looking for tasks for my employees. I would then get all of my reporting done for the day/week. I manage 10 people on a daily basis. (certain circumstances may result in more). I have had great employees, and some that were not so dependable. The not so great employees would be re-trained and held accountable by myself or my store manager. The hardest part of the day would normally be finding a balance between customer service and tasking that is a necessity. The best part of my job is two things, Customer service was truely enjoyable for me. I enjoy interacting with other people. The other most enjoyable part would be watching my entire store come together to complete a big project in a safe and timely manor."
good,Typical day at work involved unloading of trucks and preparation or distribution of merchandise for distribution or storage in the warehouse or preparing the merchandise to be sent to other locations
good,Lowe's is an excellent environment to work with great benefits. Customer controls your career. Make sure they are happy at all cost.
good,A work place of just having a simple job co workers are very friendly and we all help one another too make it a very enjoyable place to be at
good,"I don't have much to complain about when it comes to Lowes I guess. The one thing that is factual, at least at my store, it there is always something to be done. there will never be a time when all of your work is complete and you are just riding the clock. this is a plus for me because the time definitely passes fast."
good,Not a bad place to work in the Northeast Texas area. Some integrity issues with senior leadership. If you can overlook that the pay is pretty good for the area and the work/life balance is good as well.
good,Worked for 3 months almost. I thought i was progressing well and so did my supervisors but the management had other thoughts. I was trained by 3 different people all had different views on the work and techniques.
good,"Management was great when I was working there, fast pace in madison and co-workers where like family after 10yrs. heavy lifting so make sure your back is in good condision."
good,"Great job security, great benefits.  Not to much help from management on certain occasions, however they were very laid back.  Other drivers were not considerate about how they left vehicles.  I was their CDL driver, so I would come in in the morning, make sure the lumber orders were correct before loading them onto my truck.  Many times I would come in and they would be wrong due to the night crew not paying attention.  This usually set the tone for the rest of the day.  I would normally come in around 5-6 a.m. and if left the store to start my deliveries by 8 it would be a good day.  Hard part is the store i worked at the appliance delivery guys loaded in the same area i did.  so i would sometimes have to wait for them to move in order to get my loads.   Got more skill with driving the truck in narrow areas, although it was only a straight truck, it was still challenging for the area."
good,"Interesting group of people and they always put the customer's satisfaction first. Clean work environments, concerns for their employees' health/ well being during harsh weathers and all around. Most difficult was home deliveries."
good,"employees are happy to help each other learn, work as a team, able  to learn many skills, technical and social, have opportunities for advancement, positive environment."
good,I liked the job but it was a bit stressful at times. too much strain put on 1 driver to pull and delivery loads without proper time to get it ready. the people were nice and customers were good.
good,"Lowe's handles government contracts so they are governed by GSA. the legal department takes employment laws and goes over and above to protect the stores."
good,This sort of a job is not for me. I am use to restocking from other jobs but the unloading part is not me. I have more to offer a company than unloading.
good,"Its been a great learning experience. Being that i am a people person i love helping the customer and offering professional, courteous service and seeing the customers walk away satisfied at end of the day."
good,Fun place to work with a somewhat supportive management team. Job and life balance was average. I really enjoyed being helpful and friendly with customers.
good,"This is an ok place to work. I put in my time. Was glad to leave though. They do pay well, just need help with management. I didn't hate it."
good,"I have never been as appreciated by an employer as much as i am at lowes, but a lot of the upper managers don't seem to have a clue as to what it takes to get the most out of their employees."
good,"•	Garden Maintenance"
good,Lowes is a very good company to work for if you don't have a family at home. They are very customer orientated and believe in good customer service. They are willing to work with you if want to advance. They want there employees to work as a team but sometimes with so many employees and is hard to do. I work with a lot of good people and have a good time there.
good,"I had figured with my vast experience within the plumbing industry that I would move up to a managerial position, but I was quickly corrected and found that this company is a future road block."
good,Friendly place to work. Not a life time job. Fast pace and good atmosphere. Wish the benefits were better. Still a good place to work.
good,Not much to say other then I am thankful for having this job. It is sad that they tell you that you have all the talent and skills to be a great department manager then tell you that they are going to place some else in the position for various other reason. To move ahead in this job you have to be either good friends with the management team or walk around and do nothing.
good,"Work day consisted of greeting customers and stocking shelves with merchandise.  Handled inbound freight and operated store equipment such as forklift, pallet jacks and paint mixing computer."
good,"Lowes has a strong dedication to it's customers.  I was empowered as a sales specialist to take care of my customers the best I could, every time."
good,Every day is different at Lowe's.  I would have an agenda everyday that I could accomplish and would also have many other things added as the day progressed.  Fast passed sales job dealing with many different types of clients.
good,"Though I enjoy working here considering everyone is quiet friendly and enjoyable to be around, the hours are quiet unstable and range anywhere from 15 to 39 depending on how they see fit."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of entering the receiving area , communicating with the current staff and reviewing daily shipment documents , preparing receiving for daily shipment unload witch consists of clearing floor . setting up pallets , and assemble conveyor roller system . communicate with the rest of the unload team about the quantities of the load.communicate with management if there are any issues or discrepancies .  The hardest part of the job is actually getting in the trailer and filling the conveyor to be unloaded , this is the most dangerous part of the job . the enjoyable part is being able to look back at the end of the day and realize everything was accomplished safely and accurately .."
good,"The pay is great, but too little help and you are constantly over worked. Long hours. Great people to work with. No communication with the management (one manager tells u to do one thing, then the next minute another manager tells u to change it back)"
good,"Busy"" Learned to appreciate customers problems. Co-workers and management were friendly and helpful. I thoroughly enjoyed dealing with customers."
good,The longer I have worked for Lowe's the less I enjoy my job.  You can move up quickly if you can work a flexible schedule.  They offer excellent benefits and retirement.  I feel recent management changes have not been the best for our store.  Younger department managers are not leading by example. There is no accountability for errors and not proper training.
good,I really enjoyed working here and was really good at what I did. Management was really great to work with. Health insurance was not the best but it was insurance. The absences policy could use some revising.
good,"My experience with lowes revolved around being independent and self motivated. It was unique due to being a distribution center mechanic /building maintenance and the general manager being my supervisor and manager with operations separate from maintenance. A typical day started with an hour or more of network asset management program entering the previous days time , parts and costs. I set my work schedule as i seen fit, safety related repairs first, required preventative maintenance due, and power equipment repairs. My schedule was extremely full in order to follow all corporate maintenance requests involving how to do your job and the network wide preventative maintenance schedules with everything from water fountains, building columns, concrete floors requiring routine inspections, to frequent equipment breakdowns, building system break downs, requirements with safety committee, first responder obligations, to clerical duties, and janitorial type jobs with little outside contractor funds available and not other maintenance staff. Any helpers were always pulled back to operations. Management was great because he left me to be independent and self motivated. Lack of understanding with maintenance in general lead to not understanding the importance of equipment upkeep and deterioration, need for contractor assistance as a lone person in a 188,000 sq ft. distribution building doing all maintenance related tasks and much more. Co workers were frustrated with management, lack of following through with area's that needed attention, or issues, supervisor professionalism and ability"
good,Well for me a typical day at work was working in my assigned area and doing assignments your supervisor assigned to you. Best part about the day was when you were able to clock out.
good,"Most of the time we get lots of product to overstock that we have to create space accordingly."
good,"facility service  associate primary does janitorial work. above that is also responsible for ALL machinery of the store, that is every light, display, electrical socket, computer inside and outside the store and grounds. way too much for an 8 hour day.  FSA is also responsible for watching people who come in and repair machines, make sure nothing shady is going on."
good,"Management by walking around (MBWA) and associate observation and coaching is a daily responsibility. Very heavy into selling skills and goal attainment. Daily morning and evening associate huddles keeps everyone informed and on path."
good,Its a great company I love working there but I dont get the hours maybe 15 at the most which they were up front about I just need more hours and more of a set schedule.
good,Great place to fill in if your unemployed. the pay is more than you would think.
good,"Not a bad place for a student or retiree, but forget making a career of it. It does not pay a living wage, there is basically no upward mobility, and even if you eventually get full-time, you do not get a regular shift or regular days off. Your shift and days off vary week to week, you cannot plan anything in advance. Also, aside from Sales and Safety, there is very little technical training for your dept. For instance, I was assigned to plumbing, something I knew zero about, and told to take some online classes which weren't much beyond ""red means hot and blue means cold."" You learn on the job, which is not good for the customer, who is coming to you asking technical questions."
good,es tranquilo. se trabaja bien. los compañeros son respetuosos. lo q mas me gusta de la empresa es el contacto permanente con clientes en ventas
good,Assisted customers at all times and people were polite and respectful
good,"a day at work was hectic and demanding. I learned how to run a deprt and interact with customers and associates. management was rarely seen and offered little help or assistance. my coworkers were good to work with. hardest part was getting the demanding tasks that were laid upon me. the best part was connecting with customers, many would come in and look for me if only to say hi"
good,Very fast paced. Must always be on your toes. fellow employees were fun and outgoing
good,"Organized positional responsibilities but cross training a must. "
good,"Working at Lowes is a very challenging. You work so hard and don't get appreciated by the management team, instead they hold your potential in growing with the company. They don't understand your personal life and its a very stressful atmosphere to work in."
good,"When I was working as a Head Cashier, I told the manager about"
good,"I've worked at Lowe's for 11 years now, it's been a good secure job, but the pay and benefits could be better.  I transferred here from the Carbondale Illinois store."
good,Retail merchandising with team members. Also managed Paint Department and Seasonal Department. Great co-workers.
good,Plan to get a second job from september to april if you need money.
good,"Commercial sales is one of the funnest departments to work in at Lowe's. Training is slow and steady which makes it easy to learn and not overwhelming. Also, being able to create the type of relationships with customers that you can in this job is rare. Although the customers are wonderful and the atmosphere is positive, there isn't much to be said of management from my experience. The managers in my department were either not around or constantly new, so unfortunately I was unable to work with any of them long enough to give a good-hearted opinion. The co-workers, on the other hand, are irreplaceable. They give a new meaning to the phrase ""working as a team"". Going in to work everyday is like a family reunion."
good,"A typical day at work involves keeping shelves stocked, keeping the department clean, and most importantly tending to customers.  I have actually learned a vast amount about plumbing.  When I was given the position I knew next to nothing about the specifics, but I did know the basics.  Now I know an incredible amount.  If I gain nothing else from Lowe's at least I obtained this knowledge.  Management fits on a scale.  Some are great and others not so much.  However for the most part the managers are all competent and nice.  The hardest part of the job is being trapped inside a store all day and the monotony.  I do however enjoy assisting customers, with special orders, and meeting fun people.  The best part of the job is the customers and co-workers.  However customers are also one of the worst parts of the job."
good,.I enjoyed helping customer make informed decisions about their purchase
good,"A typical day starts out with doing a safety walk which involves looking around and making sure everything is safe and secure.  Down stocking any product that is needed on the shelves and taking care of the customers at the same time.  I have learned how to manage many different departments such as flooring, electrical, and outside lawn and garden where I reside at right now.  Management will always help you learn and be there to support you it is just difficult to progress with the company when you have so many people who want the same job.  My co-workers are great and we all get along amazingly.  We joke and poke fun at each other but when work is needed to be done we get right to it and get it done fast.  The hardest part of my job is the amount of product I lift day to day and the heat outside of all that it is not too bad.  The most enjoyable part of my days are helping the customers out and making sure they leave with a smile on their face."
good,the job i had was fine but i felt that a lot of the management team was lacking in coordination and understanding of employees
good,"A day at lowe's can be either good or bad. There are days where there is a lot of employees working and the day goes smoothly and there are other days where it feels like the world is crashing down on you. Being in customer service there is a lot of responsibilities I have and a lot of tasks I have to do. I answer phones, do returns, customer service, help with problems, customer and employee related all at the same time. Some times it gets stressful but if you take it all one thing at a time you can usually get through everything and time flies by. Its not a bad place to work but it sure could be better."
good,Lowes is a good place to work for. They just treat their seasonal employees different from the permanent ones. They don't offer benefits to seasonal employees. The management and co-workers are all super helpful and friendly.
good,"	I have been working with the company for eleven yrs; I have obtained job positions in verse parts of the company as followed: Head Cashier, Price Coordinator, Team Leader- paint, electrical, OSLG and flooring. My current position for the last five years is Department Manager in Tool’s. A typical day at work changes from day to day, some days can go smoothly and some days can get crazy. I have learned a lot about the company and the operational end of thing and my pay scale not too bad. The hardest part of my job is trying to keep upper management happy. Lastly would be helping people whether it is the customers or the people I’ve work with."
good,Pay is okay until you reach cap. No room for advancement especially if you possess a degree. Great people but work/life balance is completely inappropriate for a business professional.
good,"I learned management skills and important sales skills."
good,The co-workers are the best. They know how to brighten up your day. The hardest thing about the job is the lack of help around the store.
good,"It's a very busy store, Assisting customer is very enjoyable part of the job. Co-workers are helpful & friendly. Management is okay, But could really improve the advancement of employees who want to move up in the company to better themselves."
good,"Check payroll, work on area's that need additional help. "
good,"Lowe's is not a bad place to work if you are looking to get into retail or management.  The people that work there are pretty fun and diverse, and depending on the department you work in, there is a good chance you will be doing something different all of the time.  However, once you start ascending the ladder, the promotions become more about groveling and dog-and-pony shows, and not the work you actually do."
good,They are a good company.Safety is the most important. good benefits the only problem with them is they do not pay enough
good,"Interfaced by actively greeting 100 customers per shift, operated cash registers with sales totaling $10,000 during shift.  Duties include supporting call center by receiving and transferring calls to departments and managing the return station. Responsibilities included processing credit card application for personal and business purposes."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed good stability and personal interactions with my co-managers and associates.  "
good,"Handled in coming calls from customers with problems placing orders getting deliveries etc"
good,"A typical day at work is pulling my orders for delievery"
good,"It is a decent job that keeps you on your feet. I worked receiving in the back and th only issue that came up was that we were treated poorly compared to the people working on the sales floor, as if our job wasn't as important."
good,"Added accounts for clients, received mail and delivered to departments, ran a postage machine for out going mail, ran a envelope stuffing machine, received payments and enter to clients accounts. Learned out to run the machines and input information for clients. Management and coworkers where easy to work with. Making sure the correct information is entered into the computer in a required amount of time. Being in a good working environment."
good,"I started out working in the parking lot pushing in the shopping karts and was moved to unloading the trucks when the unload team quit with no warning. The people hired to work with me are immature and unprofessional and i simply can't stand to work with them anymore. Shortly I started working in unloading, the belt we used to roll the boxes out of the truck broke and we were only able to use half of it which drastically hindered our speed and efficiency. Management told us that a new belt was ordered but it wasn't until we got a new manager several months later that we learned we were lied to and no belt was ordered."
good,Part time hours get cut to nearly nothing. Poor morale among employees.
good,"lowes is a exciting place to work,you can grow with the company as long as your full time,great benefits and bonuses."
good,"Lowe's is not the worst place or best place to work at. Like every job it has its positive aspects and its negative aspects. The stores are a great resource for entry level jobs or anyone looking to advance in the retail sector. I have seen many employees climb the ranks successfully."
good,The turn over rate when I was there made it difficult to establish a good work foce
good,"I primarily worked on the receiving dock. This is where the merchandise would be loaded and unloaded from trucks. I would stock needed products and stow the reserve. I would deliver and set up appliances to residential homes. When not on the dock, I worked in the hardware department. I stocked and cleaned department as well as assisted customers."
good,Kept things balanced between here and home. Had a management team that cared and appreciate their staff. Enjoyed working here and would not mind going back.
good,"Lowe's is not a bad company to work for but as with all jobs I think if people steer clear of work drama and focus on being good employees, they'll be in a great position. I definitely learned a lot by working for this company."
good,Everyday was a good friendly work day learned how to use the computer .My  co-workers was very friendly. There was nothing hard about been a cashier .Just working in a nice envirement.jjust no hours.
good,I went to work and we had safety meetings everyday for startup and then I would start yard driving throughout the whole day. Lowe's is a very easy workplace to get fired from.
good,"enjoyed working with all the employees"
good,You can work your way up at this company but you will need to be there years upon years to earn a decent living.
good,"customer service ."
good,This is a great company to work for.  They stand by their employees and really listen to them.  Like most retail jobs their are fast paced days and slow.  I learned time management and to better my people skills.  I really enjoyed being able to help people but sometimes it was difficult when you had to tell a customer that the product they were looking for simply wasnt' available anymore and they just didn't want anything else.
good,"good people to work with, have a lot of fun, always learning, understand your needs for the most part"
good,I enjoyed working at Lowe's.  I just did not like selling extended warranties.  I don't believe in them.
good,I would go to my office print worklist and find product to begin to see what I need to get call and get credit on.  I had some co-works who did there job I had other co-workers who always want me to do there job for them. The hardest part of my job is not having people to follow policy. I enjoyed working with customers and making them feeling great about shopping at Lowe's.
good,At Lowe's you will be busy from the time you start to the time you are finished. At Lowe's you will learn how to work with and deal with different people. Management can be improved through training. Co-workers are the best thing about Lowe's.  You will build great friendships at Lowe's. The hardest part of the job is being understaffed but still held to high expectations. The most enjoyable part is working with people you enjoy.
good,Not a family oreinted place. work over 55-60 hours a week as upper management. The cooporate schedule does not offer a work life Balance. The schedule does not allow you to have much of a life outside of the work place.
good,"Receiving Dept has busy hours and deliveries or pick ups are every day what keep the business in each store, always working as a TEAM your co-workers are the best help you can find, the hardest part of the job is when we have to unload a truck most of unload items have to be done by hand."
good,"was hired to be a cashier for brand new store being built, was asked to be asst training coordinator and promised 6mth training that was required to do the job. However management never did keep their word and got mad when didnt know how to do the job."
good,"Ok place to work but could be alot better. Some of the upper management was great, others were a bit lacking."
good,"A typical night is unloading the truck,separating product ,distributing product through out the store and opening and putting product on the shelves. The job is good and I like the hours. For the most part, I enjoy working here."
good,Working in a warehouse environment can be challenging and filled with many interruptions. I've learned a great deal of things from working there. Management is not always optimal but they are open to input. Co-workers have been pretty nice and rewarding to work around. Hardest part of my job is focusing while assisting customers. The most enjoyable part of my job were definitely the benefits. 
good,"Lowe's isn't a bad company to work for in general, and the atmosphere along with the management tends to be amicable. The company offers a decent payrate and benefit package for the type of tasks they want you perform. The company is a quality place to work in maintenance for they're willing to work with you, train you and allow you to develope your skill level with time. I can only vouch for the distribution center, so if you're working storeside I'm not sure if what I've posted above would apply for there."
good,"I would review customer orders and assemble them according to date  . I learned how to follow directions by the manafactor  to assemble lot's of  grills,cabinets ,tractors ,ect . Management was very fair , they let me do my work and were very pleased . I worked with just a few people in the work area but they were all great . Hardest part of the job was when orders would come in that were already due ,because of associates not placing them correctly . Most enjoyable part was working with my hands and seeing my work after I assembled it ."
good,Lowe's is a great place to advance within the company. My situation was trying to attend school at the same time of my employment. If Lowe's is a primary concern it is a great oppurtunity.  
good,"This was an okay job. Fun at times, but when things get serious, ppl tend to walk around with a stick up their butt. Management overplays higher ups coming. They want everything PERFECT when the higher ups really just want to come interact with the employees. But overall, not a bad place to work"
good,"	Provided great customer services"
good,"A typical day at Lowes is non stop. You are constantly making an impact on the customer experience in every way.  You have a great team of co workers that are more like family.  The hardest part of the job is not being appreciated, but you meet and get to help great people everyday."
good,I learned how to work the customer service desk and all about working in the retail business.
good,I enjoyed working with this company because they provide many opportunities for advancement. My one complaint about this company is that they promote a work ethic that many of the managers do not practice. 
good,"Lowe's overall is good place to work, they are very flexible with timing and scheduling and it is a place where you can learn many things about home improvement"
good,"I loved my first 8 months. I offered to work 40 hours during my first summer 4 weeks in a row. (Part time, 25-30 hrs) In Oct, 2011 a new manager was hired. Lets just say, I lacked a lot of respect for him. A lot of favoritism at the store I worked at. When I needed time off I was given the third degree. I loved what I did, and I enjoyed working with some of the people. Very few were helpful and successful in providing EXCELLENT customer service. I loved being part of a team that I could rely on! I was a cashier, often worked at customer service. Easy to learn but a lot of multitasking, especially on busy and hectic days. I would have stayed if the management could have stepped up their game, shown respect or been replaced with people who actually have a heart and knew what they were doing. NOT every store will be the same. BUT keep an eye out. Ask current employees about management etc. Also being a cashier you will be supervised by head cashiers. Some are hard working, and polite while others will treat you like a number. Good luck!"
good,"Lowe's is currently undergoing change on how, what and what they do. This makes some days tough, but it's for good reasons."
good,i dont feel comfortable putting my personal opinions about my workplace on here!
good,"Great company to work for unless you try to go to school for any major that doesn't apply to their company. They will intemidate you either by asking you how long you ""plan"" on working there since your major doesn't apply to business or they won't ever promote you."
good,"i go in at 6am and see what truck i am that day. most of the time i drive a 24' flatbed with a moffitt on back.i check my route and check and see if my stops were pulled.if not i then go pull them and get them ready,load my truck and print my tickets.i then get checked out by manager and away i go.i am learning a lot on computer,all power equipment and safety procedures.all my co drivers are awesome and we get along great.i enjoy challenges on site with forklift and meeting new people everyday."
good,This job teaches you people skills and how to assist someone. my job was physical and mental. it was a ok environment to work in co-workers were fairly friendly and the management a bit unprofessional in some cases.
good,"Great managers who are always willing to help out. Fast paced day that is everchanging, no boredom here. Great coworkers. Sometimes work conditons are tough due to heat, cold, and rain. Helping customers create new landscapes is my favorite part of the day."
good,"Very busy location, Independent work environment, advancement opportunities constant."
good,"No complaints, the hardest part was to be on my feet all day. The people were great!"
good,Lowes is a good place to work. had a good relationship with management and its employees. alot of room for advancement.
good,Lowes is a good company that pays better than most of the competitors. The company is very heavy on customer service and team work. Sometimes it was hard lifting heavy items but for the most part there was always help.
good,Fun easy job. The employees were great. Would be an ideal part time job for a student
good,Lowe's recently restructured and downsizing; resulting in corporate compensation package change and a career path that is no longer in line with my goals.
good,"Worked three 14 hour days, fri, sat and sun. Very tired by sun evening."
good,"A typical day involved customer service, cashiering, working lumber and the garden center."
good,I work at Lowe's from 930pm to 600am. I really learned how to a business really works. I definately got an idea of how the recieving and shipping system works. Management seemed to fluxuate often which I didnt mind. I did mind the fact they would change many policies very frequently. My co- worker was were very fun to work with we all knew how to work and laugh at the same time. The hardest part about was the elements. The building had very poor ventilation making it easy for me to burn out but I was able to bare it.The enjoyable part was at the end of the week when got paid
good,"After 11 years of service with Lowe's, I can say I've learned a great deal regarding a retail environment. There is a tremendous amount of knowledge within Lowe's and the company seems to be on a great track in the future."
good,Work flow was always busy and time went by rapidly. I learned the value of great customer service and treating those as how I wanted to be treated when shopping anywhere.
good,Strives for customer focus. promotes excellent customer service. Cares about the community
good,"Good place to work if your into the home decor or home improvement aspect of the world. Busy at times and management was never really helpful in most departments. If they needed to cut employees because of the company budget they would try and find a reason to let an employee go. Co-workers were amazing and always willing to help. Good benefits and stock plan + 401k plan is a big thing. Not very high paying job, even if you have been there for many years."
good,"Freight is usually staged when i clock in, so i start working asap. I do the heavy freight first,then i work on the palletized freight. Management is ok. Co-workers are good. The most enjoyable part was that i got paid fairly well."
good,"Help customers with their individual needs with our products. Learned communication skills working with different customers. Management was great always there to help if needed. Co-workers were helpful, good team work. I really enjoyed helping every customer that came in."
good,"The company itself is a great company with great values, but the one that i work for is alright too. On a typical work day i unload trucks with a great team. We get along well together as well as a few others in the store, but management is kind of pushy at times. I wouldn't make it my career buts its OK for now ."
good,I enjoyed working there. Sometimes the shedules would change without notice
good,Prepared medical office for patient-intake
good,"Dependent upon the day, Lowe's can be a wonderful place to work. The people are fun and entertaining and can be great assets. Other days however, and these are far more common, it can be a tedious job and it can be just completely ridiculous. Management is good, except that the managers that actually stick up for their employees are leaving. So all we have now are the ones that just go through the motions and pick out particular employees to make their lives miserable for childish and petty reasons."
good,"Everything was fine, you just never knew if you were doing unsatifactory work until the last minute, because management was not communicating effectively."
good,"I like this job to a point, I am looking for something with a set schedule and maybe a little less of unnecessary stress that occurs in retail. Lowes does offer good 401k and health benefits. Along with great products, promotions, and customer service. But the key employees that brings in business they dont pay very well."
good,"Environment that takes pride in providing exceptional customer service to different types of customers (contractors, DIY homeowners, etc.)."
good,Good hours and good pay! They forgot to give me my benefits even after I reminded them multiple times. HR was not on there game but rest of management was great!
good,"Lowe's is a standard when it comes to Retail, so Customer Service is focused on. Keeping the store clean and filled outside of helping the Customer is your way of life."
good,"Learned more about home improvements, and home design then i ever thought i would. learned skills that i can use anytime in the future."
good,"Nice benefits, good place to work, salaried managers have to work alot of hours, lots of stress"
good,"good place work, I just felt underpaid for the work i did for the company"
good,There can be a little less focus on customer service and more focus could be put on the employees.
good,"The Lowe's store that I work at is a good place to work, however the senior management staff is not where they need to be. What I mean by that is they pass off responsibilities to the next person, and they don't have your back when it's most needed. I love what I do, but I don't feel that I am compensated for what I do. I enjoy helping people come up with ideas for their home improvement projects, and learning new things. The hardest part about my job is when I have irate customers that call me stupid, among other things; after all I am human too. My days at work are typically really busy, consisting of a lot of walking and talking. I have some amazing co-workers and even better customers that frequent."
good,"Great company however the environment is very demanding and if you're not customer friendly or able to take a lot of abuse, its not for you."
good,"At the Lincoln, NE store, it's enticed mixed feelings. For retail, the pay is very fair. The hours tend to suck week to week though. Clopeners (closing shift followed immediately by an opening one) happen a few times a week. They also tend to give multiple minishifts (such as 4hrs or less) to part time employees, but make them come in 6x's a week instead of giving them a few real shifts. Management at this store is unwavering and the HR manager is overly strict. Also, as of late, they've been firing without real reason or cause, so walking on eggshells is a must for skills if you are to work here."
good,"Fun place to work, fast paced, some problems with priorities with managment but overall good place to work."
good,It was a pretty relaxed atmosphere for me. Management is pretty open about everything that goes on. They have regular reviews and raises.
good,Lowe's is a wonderful place to work. I worked there for 10 1/2 years ebfore being wrongly terminated due to budget cuts. Never did I have a problem until the current store manager came to that store then all heck broke loose there.
good,"lowes offers security and great benefits."
good,The people you work with make the job tolerable on the daily basis. Corporate is a joke and doesn't care for employees. The CEO is a bigger joke who has made a habit of driving companies into the ground. Its a job and it pays. Nothing more.
good,"When I first started working at this company, it felt like I was being welcomed into a giant family. Customer service was our mantra, however recent changes from higher-ups have made it feel like stock holders are more important than the customers. Be careful applying for a management position: they might do away with your position and give your responsibilities to an already overworked co-worker."
good,Was employed at this location for almost 3 years. I truly enjoyed working there and was disappointed to find out we were getting laid off. The program had many flaws but I think it could've been salvaged.
good,Just don't feel as if I am appreciated.Not getting paid for the abilities that I have think that they should have more one on one with the employees ..........................................
good,"If you perform at a high level you are well compensated for your effort. Management is all about the numbers, making sure they achieve all of their metrics, perhaps at the detriment of their associates."
good,"Good company that you can grow with if you work hard.  Very high expectations for anyone in a management position.  Excellent benefits. It's retail so be prepared to work weekends, nights, and long hours especially if in a management position."
good,The new manager is heartless and terminated employees (one of them who opened the store and was a WWII vet and in his 90's) if he felt they made too much.
good,Not too bad if you don't work there for a long time. Major burn out over time. Co workers are friendly for the most part. Worst part was the customers who were extremely misogynistic.
good,Good money if you hit all the inbetween steps but terrible work life balance for managers. Normal associates may not make as much but have more consistant scheaduled hours. Days off are random for associates.
good,The job itself isn’t bad at all you get to work at your pace within the time frame you’re given. The store management is where the company is lacking in my opinion. The managers hardly communicate efficiently to one another and that leaves the associates confused and misinformed.
good,"I enjoy working with leadership, team members and management. The work atmosphere is pleasant and I have thoroughly enjoyed most of my years here. There are a lot opportunities for career advancement here."
good,You pretty much are thrown in a position to learn how to do things yourself . Lowe’s is like every other retail store . I’m blessed to have the hours that I have
good,"I believe that the store was chronically understaffed. Management was lacking in on the floor experience,  more time being giving for the training in duties expected. Management was often unable to achieve their duties due to lack of reliable staffing."
good,We need HR managers back the regular ones can’t do everything and can’t keep up they don’t stay in touch with you it’s a mess overall without HRs. It sucked sorry to say Lowes period needs help over all since always dealing with less coverage. Nobody can’t manage had horrible supervisors. We were not a team there while I was there. That can be worked on everywhere.
good,very organized and productive job. management and work environment was very friendly and professional. good training and great opportunities to move up in the company.
good,I enjoy working at Lowe’s but being as young as I am I need more of a challenge and production. The people are friendly at times but not perfect. That’s just the job world.
good,Lowe's RDC strives to be a safe work place and has safety involved in every job. From 6S for a cleaner and safer work environment to safety team and safety blitzes.
good,"Corporate rotation of the schedule is the main problem I have with this company. Overall not a bad job, great team of co-workers. It depends on the department your in as far as over time."
good,I was one of the first employees to start working at the Call Center upon its arrival to the city.  I was completely loyal to the company but was overlooked for a promotion on more that one occasion.  I decided to seek other employment. I felt that I was being used to train new comers to the department.
good,"everyday was fun dealing with customers"
good,"Used to be a lot better in my opinion. With the change in CEO and the entire overhaul going on at the moment, there are a lot of issues. Now everyone has rough spots when change occurs but I feel that this is leading to an unrecoverable situation. It doesn't feel as if Lowe's is focused on a personal customer experience level anymore and tends to cater to the Pro/Contractor side of it all, which is understandable. This change, however, has left many of my faithful customers almost feel unwelcome in the ""home"" they used to have with us."
good,The coworkers are like a second family. They are very understanding when it comes to your family. Your children come first and they know that. Pretty flexible
good,"I loved working at lowes when I started, and I continued to love it for about a year and a half. Coworkers and associates in the store are friendly and willing to help out when you ask. Due to policy changes and shifting management, the quality of work started to degrade over this last summer and it became very stressful when hours were cut during the busiest time of year. Overall very nice place to work!"
good,when I work at Lowes they a humble welcome and a great presentation of whats required of your position. There training course that you take that help understand your position. Management is very helpful to direct you to fulfill your assignments. The hardest part of the job is to suit customers needs. Enjoyable part of the job is that mostly everybody is laid back.
good,Lowes was once a great place to work. they have made changes at the corporate level and these changes have not benifitted the hourly employee in their stores.
good,Good place to work if you don't mind having your hours cut during off season periods.  Management does make it a priority that you do take your breaks regardless of how busy the store is.
good,I had a set schedule with weekends off. Rules were always changing because managers were always changing. Instead of replacing managers from in store they brung them from other stores. A lot of items don’t ring up so we had to  constantly get a price check. Employees got 10% discounts but so did every customer that complained about prices. Managers constantly adjusted prices for customers to shut them up
good,The most stressful part was when a lot of cars would need to be loaded at once and there were only two loaders working at the time. The hardest part about the job was the constant heat. I learned how to drive a forklift and that was also the most enjoyable part about working at Lowe's.
good,Work environment is good. Need to improve on technology front which is currently happening. High level management are sometimes very ambitious witg timeline that is directly affecting the quality of products.
good,I hate the 11-8 hours!! They don’t do shift bids!! Seniority doesn’t matter. They don’t respect minorities. They need more diversity classes. It is room for growth if you know someone.
good,Lowes is a good place to start a career plenty of room to advance in the company and overall good people to work with.. Benefits are good they work with you..
good,"It is a good place to work and generally is a consistent work environment. But the company is going through a lot of stressful situations and is putting a lot of pressure on their management team. The pressure is starting to trickle to every employee and you can feel it. So overall good with hours and pay, but a but stressful right now."
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for but it doesn't pay the salary that I need. I learned a lot from working at Lowe's. Unfortunately you cannot work overtime. I'm looking for a job paying a better salary.
good,"Working at lowes is not for the faint hearted. You walk on concrete, sitting, standing, bending, lifting. Hardest part of the job is probably lifting. You have teammates to help you lift. Management can vary from store to store. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendships you gain with your coworkers."
good,"are responsible for making sure all assigned areas of the hotel are cleans, neat and tidy."
good,"I liked my job and helping customers attain their dream flooring. However, this organization is poor. Trying to sell product but having to be a stocker also and run in an out of other departments helping. I was paid about 5 dollars a hour more than a customer support role but still had to spend 50% of my time doing that instead of focusing on sales and customer service. They have 3 different computer programs that you have to do for one installed sale and have to make notes in 2 of them every week. Product comes in for customer orders and if it is a stock item their name is not one it so you may miss it because there is so much merchandise and customers trying to keep track, very much time wasted."
good,"Just finished my 1 year anniversary.  Excellent company to work for."
good,My local Lowes was not too bad. My manager were kind and helpful. I just wasn't  found of the job. I like to move and keep busy. This job was uninvolved and monotonous. Great job to start with not good for a career.
good,Fun place to work. Every one is pretty chill. If your looking for a full time job I would recommend this but as a part time like myself the job doesn’t fit my life I need benefits and better pay
good,Too many managers that each have an idea of how they want things ran. Bad communication between managers the rotating schedule changes which manager you will see on any certain day. That makes it hard for the managers to get on the same page with the departments.
good,"3 years with the company.  My sector of the business evolves around installed services.  The challenge is we are the only company in the USA that runs installed services from a retail store perspective."
good,"Fast paced, lots of physical labor. Competitive pay. Company takes an active interest in both their employees and community. Paid time off to volunteer in the community."
good,"Hrs where up and down,as in weekend work for full and part time. Good friends to work with and managers sometime were understanding in special situations."
good,"its a worker ant mentality"
good,"the short amount of time i worked there, i didn’t favor it much. the pay was excellent, but you’re required to stand in one spot for a very long period of time and the “flow” was very slow."
good,I love to help people with things cashier is one of them meeting dofferent people for different things that need to be done talking to people listen just being a team member
good,"For the most part working at Lowe's was a decent job to have. There were a couple issues, mainly related to the lack of staffing. Also there is a lack communication during training. Its more like them throwing you into the fire without all the correct training and only assisting when there is a customer complaint. The pay is a definite bonus, it is a bi-weekly pay schedule and they hire off of experience. Basically if you have a lost of customer service experience the higher you hourly payment is."
good,"Lowes was my first real job, they taught me a lot of responsibility although they were inconsistent with their hours and there was noticable favoritism within the work environment"
good,"On your feet all day, no breathing time.  Customer oriented and driven.  Satisfy the customer at all costs.  Worked in a strong team environment.  Management worked well together."
good,The employees are friendly and willing to help if your struggling. Easy to get along with and know. Will check in on you to see if your okay after prolonged absence. Customers can be a hassle and can sometimes be very stressful especially around the holidays or during a huge sale. Willing to work with you and are willing to give you extra time training if you truly need it.
good,"Lowe's was a decent place to work. It allowed me to work with customers face to face. It also gave me further experience in retail/sales. Most of all, it allowed me to really focus on and see materials and their applications in building."
good,I work there for five years the company is run mostly by upper management and has less say on the company itself. Working for the company has taught me that drastic changes in corporate is never a good thing
good,It was my first job and i appreciate working there but somethings would never change since they come up wity things thatll benefit the store but only to make it harder for us.
good,It was a great place to work employees and customers. It could be stressful at times especially when it was busy. Learned a lot that I didn’t know. Management was nice and understanding.
good,Working at Lowe's had its moments. There were good and bad days. The environment was slow paced mostly but around people getting off work was when things got fast paced. Learning new skills to grow on at a register and learning how to enhance my customer service skills was a good asset to myself. Bonding with coworkers and working together as a team was the most enjoyable part.
good,"good work environment, great employees, team work. Sometimes work with your schedule, find help in every corner, get ready to deal with a lot of different customers. so control yourself. hahaha"
good,"great workplace if you plan on staying with the company"
good,"Management is poorly structured, to many Managers giving orders to certain people only, not willing to help out, they ignore to many serious issues that results in most of the best employees to look for job's elsewhere. They cut hours way to much, leaving one or two people to run fived to six departments and all this accomplishes is a stressful work environment and angry customers."
good,"I very much enjoyed my time at Lowes"
good,I first started everyone was great but as I was going into months I was seeing true colors.  All of my department is gone we are just down to 4 ppl.  2 shifts maybe 3 if we are lucky. No one comes for code 3s when we need them.  Managers some are OK.  Hr we don't see him hardly. And way under staff in all departments. Now I see why. 1️⃣ department has to run 2-3 department on top of theirs cause no staffing. By the time you know it is going to be a ghost town.
good,Do not want to comment on Lowes. They have filled a work life for me. Lowes is a good place to work part time. They have opening for part time if you want to work there.
good,"Great place to work, plus job security is great. Lowes is always looking for workers that can help make the business flow in the right direction. Just be willing to work."
good,The job should defiantly pay more than it does. The hard work and labor you put it should start at a $12.00 hr rate I say up to $15.00 hr. It's a lot of drama in the plant and their over time rules are unfair.
good,A typical day at work was relative low stress because it was the same thing every day simple tasks that needed to be done within a specific time frame. I learned that if you wanted something to get done you needed to learn how to communicate with others well for the job to be done successfully. Management left a lot to be desired schedules were always a mess and it was incredibly disorganized. The workplace was very cutthroat it was better to keep to yourself and just do your job. The lack of support from management was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the regular customers who were all around great.
good,"I good place to work overall.  After years my schedule is inconsistent. Expect to work weekends and all holidays except Christmas.The pay is fair. Co-workers friendly. A good amount of employee turn over but I guess that is also with a lot of other big box stores. Managers mostly helpful. If you want addition training in your field Lowe's is good. One can learn a lot about products, etc. And as always, some customers are great, others not so much."
good,"It was a great place to learn about how the company works, very helpful people for when you have a question about what you don't understand. I would go back again without question."
good,"Lowes is a large cooperation that treats their customers with respect and please their needs. A typical day at Lowes is clocking in, and walking to my proper cashier area and checking customers out and getting them, and to have a nice day. I learned that they are prioritize customers. The management is rude and unorganized as well, they do not give you notice for when they switch your shifts. The workplace is the same, most of the employees speak negatively about other employees and that is not a good work environment. The hardest part of the job was having time with school to take days off with a month notice and getting refused those days. The most enjoyable part of the working at Lowes was probably getting to know the customers that came in."
good,Lowe's is stressful on a daily basis. Sitting for 8 plus hours a day takes a toll on your body I did not expect. The temperature in the building is freezing cold meanwhile nothing can be done about it except wearing jackets and covering up with a blanket all day. The job itself isn't hard and I don't mind doing the work. I am not the type of person to be stuck in an office all day long as I worked 13 years at CVS prior to this.
good,Lowes is a wonderful environment to work in the supervisors are nice and the staff as a whole is wonderful however the processes and programs lowes uses are terrible and never work consistently.
good,"Loved the people i worked with, the people i worked with made this work environment tolerable. I was laid off after the seasonal period ended, yet tried to plan for it by seeking new employment within and outside of Lowes."
good,Lowe's over all is a good company. It's dose lack the time to full train those on the floor but if you can pick up quickly you will succeed if you want to.
good,"Lowe's is one of the better retail companies to work for because of competitive pay and career opportunities, but recent changes have me looking elsewhere."
good,"Working at Lowes was both competitive and fulfilling. I would like to highlight that the team at the Lowes I was working at was highly collaborative and helpful as coworkers and associates, regardless of whether or not I was currently in the midst of a shift or not. "
good,"The best thing about working for Lowes is the benefits. They off stock at a 15% discount for employees, 401K, they match 100% up to the first 3%, 50% match up to 5% and 25% at 6%. They also offer dental, vision, and medical as well as many others."
good,Every lowes hires people for part time but when work slows down they cut all the part timers hours to 10 hours a week if you get lucky enough you might get 12 or 14 hours max.
good,The days spent working at lowes moved incredibly slow. It was a challenge to complete all tasks assigned to you because of the respoonsibility to assist customers. Some customers can be very polite and respectful while others can be very rude and disrespectful.
good,"Restructuring made many employees leave.  Poor management is reported to me by people I know who still work there.  Poor scheduling, poor training, clopening often required."
good,"Everyone is very nice and friendly, works as a team. Like helping out all the customers. Dogs come in all day long, get to pet them all. Management is very flexible with your schedule"
good,"I love everything about Lowe’s except scheduling. Your availability has to be 5 am- 11 pm everyday. Lots of closing and opening at the next day, you won’t get enough rest. One day work as opening the next mid or closing. Once an while you get weekend off."
good,I worked as an unloader at Lowe's which you take all the merchandise inside of trucks and put them on pallets and take them to their respective isles. On days we did not have trucks we would stock the selves with product that other coworkers could not get to in time.
good,It started out great when i first started working there. But then i got moved to a different department and the management wasn’t very good. The workers weren’t very good either i was pretty much one of the bosses there because i had to tell other employees what to do.
good,"The job was difficult because you had to work with old computer software which was difficult to understand. Standing around for long hours hurt my legs most of the time I worked my shift. Other than that, management was fair and some of my co workers were fun to be around. There could of been more associates in every department to support customers. Overall, it was not the worst job in the world."
good,"Local store is a great place to work, Managers are respectful and good mentors. Corporate seems a little messed up with inventory scheduling issues  (Too much of something arrives all at once, can't get restocked in timely fashion on items that are selling ""Hot"".)"
good,"The company was nice, but was prone to change as they struggle to stay cutting edge. Wages were nice for a starting job but moving the your pay up could be really difficult."
good,Lowe's was good i loved working there helping customers. Just overtime it just feel off. I really don't have much to say because it's the past and i don't loathe in it
good,"My day would consist of sales, I would greet customers and answer any question they may have on products that we sold. the hardest part of my job was loading appliances into customers vehicles as they were very heavy. I enjoyed meeting new people and getting know them."
good,"Unfortunately, Lowes isn't what it use to be. Work loads have increased considerably and staff has been cut in half. The chances for promotion are very slim, even for employees with a long work history"
good,My management team was very understanding and worked around my school schedule and activities. Work was somewhat fast-paced depending on the employees that day.
good,"Lowes was a good company to work for overall, however, the long term vision of the company seemed to change constantly witch made for a confusing environment for the employees.  How they wanted to run the day to day operations, train the employees or interact with the customers never seemed to be clear as they reacted to circumstances more than planned for the future."
good,"With helpful management, a rather relaxed work environment, and an emphasis on cooperation. If only the customers were more understanding and the store easier to run."
good,"Would be a great place to work for if they had more employees working and it was not so inventory based company"
good,Lowe’s became a place that wanted to cut out good people that had been there for years to replace us with part time people! Not fair! Watched them just say good bye to a lot of great managers that really cared about Lowe’s to replace them with part time people
good,"LOTS of men shop at Lowe's. If you're a woman wanting to work here, just watch for harassment. I get asked out and asked for my phone number too much here."
good,Have to take care of the customers first. Customers demand you know about certain items. Your constantly trying to make the customer happy. Our goal was to help people love where they live.
good,Enjoyed coming to work and working with team. Learned about the different departments I was assigned. LOWE'S is a diverse environment of hard working people which makes it enjoyable to work with. The hardest part about my job is learning different departments witch is a challege.
good,"A very friendly and welcoming place to work. It didn't matter if it was a bad or stressful day at work because at the end of the day, your friends were your co-workers and it was enjoyable being there."
good,"The management doesn’t attend to the problems that goes on outside the garden center."
good,"I worked in shipping and receiving unloading trucks and putting stock on the pallets accordingly , though I wasn't there long enough they eventually teach you to drive the fork lift"
good,"The hardest part of the job was watching managers take credit for your hard work, and avoiding teaching new employees. Injury compensation is abysmal, they will fight giving it to you every step of the way.Managers are infamous for not sending in compliments an employee receives to the company, or even informing the employee. The best part was helping customers love where they lived, and help improve it."
good,enjoyed working there they treated the employees with different awards like holiday meals and bonus the hardest part of this job is dealing with the sometime fickle customer service other than that it's great.
good,I have been working at Lowes for 2 year and I have been promoted two times. They were very through in their training process and they were very good learning experiences.
good,Help contractor and customers in sales relating to their goals and needs in construction and home improvement needs.  I learned how to be a better salesmen and a better employee overall.  Opportunity for management is the best at Lowe's than I've had than any other job.  Workplace is a bit cut throat but not to where it is completely unenjoyable.  Hardest part of the job was having enough time or getting the customer everything they needed.  Most enjoyable part of the job was giving the customer a great experience and helping them have a better day.
good,"We worked steady without layoffs.  Opportunies for learning and advancement were readily available.  After five years, three weeks of vacation time was available.  Good retirement plan."
good,"The pay was average, cold be better. Not much room for advancement unless a full-time employee. Otherwise, more hours could be offered to part-time employees."
good,"Great job for someone who likes consistency, teamwork, and opportunity. Flexible scheduling is also nice. Great place to learn retail, customer relationships, and corporate culture!"
good,"Was able to learn a lot - those who like to work and do it well are often rewarded. Management seems to not have clear sales plan or is unable to clue all employees into said plan. Customers were often taken care of and there were defiantly ways to appeal to them. Culture is so-so, some make it a permanent career while others come and go. Benefits were decent to good; hard to fin these days."
good,"Great company for over 10 years, seems they want to get rid of people that have been working there for double digits years. No loyalty anymore. Never felt secure anymore"
good,Company is good as a whole but there's a lot to be desired. Need to have more people on the floor to help the customers and to help each other  this would be a gReat place to work if they would have more help care about the customer experience
good,"Came in as the place opened from day one, met some good people and worked with them awhile, all are gone now. They will be missed. Do not know of current state of Lowes, been gone 14 years."
good,Nice place to work to gain warehouse experience as well as customer service skills.  And you become knowledgeable about products sold here. I recommend to anyone.
good,"Nice place to work if you have no creative spirit. Not great if you have a family due to ever changing schedule and odd ball hours. You can work at 5:30 am one day and 11 to 10 pm the next. Two day off weekends are only every three weeks, making a life outside of work hard."
good,"good place to work , and i would recommend my friends to work there. the place can be relaxed but they also work as a team. i really working with my manager."
good,"Working at Lowe's is amazing at first but after a while they start showing true colors. Personally Lowe's main concern is their sales, they make that a main priority, but pay is good."
good,Full-time employees have to be available for every shift ~5am-~11pm. Not very practical with small children at home. Overnight shifts for floor reset.
good,"You are on your feet your whole day, and the hours drag by. The management needed improvement, but the pay is great and there are definitely opportunities for advancement. I was not in a good place when I worked here so my experience with it was not great. Take this review with a grain of salt."
good,"Great company, amazing ethics standards. Would go back in a instant, if I were offered a chance. My last postion with the company taught me a lot that I used outside the work place."
good,"Can be a fun place to work if there are enough people hired. It can become very stressful when one person has to do 3 people's job. "
good,Lowes was a good place to work. Management was not that great but the job overall was pretty awesome. I would definitely recommend to any one in need of job.
good,"I enjoyed my responsibilities at Lowes, but if you need a job with better advancement possibilities this as most jobs like this are not the right place to be."
good,"When working for Lowes Improvement, the first thing you notice is diversity. Lowes offers an equal opportunity, helps people to learn the many departments it offers to the public and you they teach home improvement duties that can be helpful when owning a home."
good,"Since many associates worked at the same location for a long time.The ones who were promoted to supervisors,would play favoritism to their ""clicks"" as far as time off and making the schedule"
good,I have enjoyed my time at this company.  I would like to find a different challenge.  The company is changing and I have lost some belief in the overall direction the company is going
good,"You had to work on weekends unless you were a manager's favorite, you had plenty of opportunities to work overtime which was a good thing at times. Your schedule varies"
good,Lowes was a great place to work. The only issue I had working at Lowes was the fact that I drove a nice distance to work there so I wasn't really making any money and the chance for advancement is extremely low.
good,"This job is for the detail oriented. Changes daily as you move on to the next department."
good,"Some days are busier than others for a cashier. Either you will be constantly at work, scanning items and interacting with customers, or you will be standing at your station, waiting for customers to check out through your line. While you're waiting for customers, you patiently stand with a smile on your face, and you may tidy up your work space by rotating products or organizing them. What makes this job enjoyable is the customer interaction. Some customers are more talkative than others and tell you interesting stories about themselves."
good,"Working at Lowe's has been a very rewarding experience. I have learned a lot about assisting customers over the phone, and working with them and the stores to get delivers out in an efficient manor."
good,Overall Lowe's is a good place to work in you are going to work in the Retail Sector.  As a manager there I have the authority to run my part of the business as I think it should be with input from the store manager.  Each and everyday is exciting as you have to opportunity to interact with my different types of customers and associates.  The only downside to working for Lowe's can be expected in many other retail companies.  The working hours can be long and involves nights and weekends which can have a negative impact of work life balance.
good,"Overwhelming at time. Lack of staff, a lot of changing within the company. It need to be more organize. I love my job but throughout the years 'it fell off. I love my customers and some staff, I build years of relationship."
good,"Management was my biggest issue, over where I worked a specific department manager was an issue, talking and gossiping behind employees backs. A good lowe's store depends very much on the management that works there."
good,Not a bad place to work. Everyday is not the same and if you like to troubleshoot things for customers this is a good place. Only bad things are late evening and weekends but you get used to it
good,Highly dedicated and responsible Lowe’s Sales Specialist with a strong history of good customer service and company loyalty. Adept at functioning well independently with little to no supervision or as part of the Lowe’s sales team. Flexible scheduling availability to include evening and weekend work as required.
good,Depending on what store you worked at and the management team at the store dictated the work place environment. I worked at stores with both great and okay management team's
good,Filled with knowledgeable employees who are on the most part confident enough to relax in their positions. Management varies from store to store and may or may not depend upon the store General Manager.
good,the hardest part of the job is having a different personality for each employee you are over. I personally am a very direct person and know what I want done and what needs done and am not very good a sugar coating it. Im nice about it but direct and in the way Lowes runs their business you have to sugarcoat everything so nobody takes you wrong or gets their feelings hurt
good,"order management, keeping your zone clean to make it easier for the customer to shop, sales.sales,sales,sales. The workplace culture is good lowe's hires a lot of great people."
good,just started so far so good I notice tht there is a fast paced but fast way to get hired on to the company for higher wages with in a year you can get hired
good,"Excellent atmosphere with ability to move up in right circumstance. You learn a lot about the items in the store. Fast paced, physical, and fun. If you go to work with the right attitude then you will be fine."
good,The Lowe's environment provides a safe and family like setting. The work was simple but there were many safety regulations that requires one to follow. The 992 Lowe's Distribution Center provides a great environment.
good,Lowe's IT laid off hundreds of employees and are replacing them off-shore. This is killing the culture and all the good employees are jumping ship. The culture was great but it's hard to know what the future holds.
good,i worked in the back unloading the trailers by hand some days it took long some days it didnt take long at all and we stocked products in the place it goes
good,"It was a great place to work but had problems with them scheduling, I was going to school full time and they were working me 40 hrs a week. I loved the people I worked."
good,"go to work, clock in, work, go to lunch, come back, clock back in, work some  more, clock out , go home.. pretty straight foward. i was only a seasonal employee but it showed how much management cared about us no matter what they always tried to help."
good,"It's only good if you have a great management team. You'll love the environment, and the benefits of the job. Ever since January of 2017 cut full time employees, and rumors of more job cuts happening in the 3rd quarter, Lowe's image has been poorly portrayed. I hope they know what they're doing."
good,Lowes is a good place to work with excellent benefits the knowledge that you recieve can help you advance into future careers.the different positions that you work in is extremely helpful
good,"Working for Lowe's was a eye opener. They help me become a better person as a worker for the time of me being there. The hardest part of my job title was learning new codes as a cashier for the computers. Everything else was a breeze for me, and another normal day at work."
good,this place is great if you wanna give up on life. Think 2 steps above Wal Mart but you're still in misery. This is where dreams go to die in the trash can.
good,"A lot of standing as a cashier, always moving registers to outside or to the front registers. i learned to always have your head on a swivel for theft."
good,Good temporary or seasonal job for my skills set.  If you are sales driven or great at a particular craft you can do better than I did.  HR was always accessible and very helpful.  Shift management depended on the person.
good,The company is great overall. The store I worked in was okay. The core values are good and honest. The benefits are great. Most of the management was o.k.
good,"Not impressed with management. Otherwise, a good place to work. Mostly nice employees, But no real structure. Also, Pay not great for the cost of living."
good,"I greeted customers, handled sales and service. Always handled monies accurately. I enjoyed learning about home improvement and garden ideas. The hardest part of the job was having to lift heavy items."
good,The amount of skills and product knowledge you can learn here is amazing. It can be very productive depending on who works in your department. The workplace culture is heavily influenced by management since you work side by side with them on the floor
good,"I would have to say my experience working at lowes was very fun."
good,"Cashiers also double as loss prevention and security. Though limited in what you can actually do to prevent theft, we were encouraged to at least get dates/times/descriptions. There was also a reward system in place for finding mistakes at the register area, such as tag swapping and hidden items. The Customer Service Desk was horribly understaffed for the 100 days of mayhem in the summer - our store needed a MINIMUM of 2 people up there at all times, but preferably 3 just to have one person dedicated to the phone ringing off the hook. For the pay, the cashier duties overall were worth it. I made only a dollar more to be a manager in other retail jobs."
good,Lowes is a great place to start you job search they do offer advancement and competitive pay. If you consider a cashier position you will lack hours in the winter.
good,"Let me start by saying this- I love my Lowe's family. The atmosphere that my coworkers created is warm, friendly, and makes me enjoy going into work. The job itself also is great: flexible hours, decent time for breaks, most things in the store can be learned quickly, etc. Management has always been kind of iffy; however, it has gotten terrible in the past few months. The store is constantly understaffed, and the new employees that they hire are basically being paid to do nothing. There is also blatant favoritism shown by the managers to certain employees."
good,"This position involves all departments of the store. Working close with specialist to ""help people love where they live"". Sales goals are weekly based and can be very hard to reach. Management is supportive in assisting with reaching goals. This position involves a lot of time and project management."
good,"There is always something new to learn,  huge amount of people who nicely help you to grow up and feel comfortable, you must be able at any time of the day to work there."
good,"Work at Lowe's has many benefits.  If you work in the call center, you will find yourself working 3 different shifts.  You will also work 1 weekend out of the month.  It is very fast paced, and if you can't handle working on the computer all day and answering calls all day, than this job is not for you.  You will often have unhappy customers on the phone.  Most of the time though, you will be assisting them with problems and helping them resolve them.  The training on the computers could be much better.  Management is often hard to get in touch with if you need assistance.  The company tries to make the job more fun and less mundane by having games and potlucks.  The benefits are good.  Vacation time is good.  Nice cafe and food court on on the premises, as well as walking trails.  There is also a nurse there on site.  The pay could be better, considering the size of the company."
good,"I have learned how to operate a register, communicate with customers directly, how to organize product and different gardening equipment/tools. Also keeping ails in presentable conditions at all time."
good,I worked for Lowes for over 12 years and was a job that when I got up in the morning I enjoyed go to everyday.  I was in a management position so there were long hours but there were many opportunity's for advancement.  It was a work place were u could work your way up to what ever position you wanted to reach for.   I enjoyed the staff and working with other people who also wanted to be at their job (not there to just collect a pay check).   The company continues evolve and I prefer to shop at Lowes as to the other competitors who provide same product at almost the same prices but Lowes provides better atmosphere and knowledgeable happy associates.....though with the last restructure the seems to be less visibility of them on the sales floor.
good,"Cool place to work but management is lame, nobody cares about doing the right thing all they care about is kissing butt to move up the latter and that's how it goes at Lowes."
good,I started off as a part-time unloader and quickly became full-time. I got so familiar with each department and stock items that I eventually became the stores floater (position doesn't exist)
good,"nice people to work with. good opportunities to move up in management. mediocre insurance. great work schedule. terrible upper management. management on the main floor is inconsistent."
good,"Good job for kids or elderly ppl, I actually loved this job for a long time. I eventually left because of a head boss that had his head up his a hole. Too stressful and intimidating environment for $11.00 an hour"
good,Management could be a whole lot better. They can appreciate their associates more. They also dont pay their associates what they deserve to be paid for their hard work.
good,Logistically inefficient company.  Redundant handling of freight wasting time/man-hours….no one seems to care in upper-management.  Submit ideas for process-improvement….nobody cares.  It's all about the sales figures.
good,Great place to start but retail life is not for family folk. Its no place for family that plays together and wants to stay together. Its just a demanding schedule to be a part of.  Had some of the best cranky co workers to work with. We laughed and cried together. I really enjoyed working one-one one with customers and that is why I branched out on my own and into Handyman service. The hours changed and I got my family back. All jobs at the top take a lot of understanding from you family members and if you can have the balls to take and not feel a thing then retails the life.
good,"Overall its a great place to work, if you're a hard worker and dependable you will get noticed. Definitely opportunity for advancement. Customer service is a top priority."
good,"Busy customer service and good education on products "
good,"I like lowes in itself and everything they stand for, My management isn't all that great due to a lack of communication between my dp and asm. The pay is pretty well for what your doing, although I find myself board from time to time as not in I don't have anything to do but my department in general which is paint besides down stocking because boring after not having very many customers when its the winter season."
good,I love my customers and interacting with people. learned early on to do my job well and keep my nose out of others business. also learned that a retail business like lowes goes through a lot of management but that's corporate doing. loved going in a beginning of morn and waiting on contractors to get there lumber and heading to the job for the day. got along with all my coworkers and they all liked me. hardest part of job was settleing people down if they thought price was wrong but always got them to laugh at end.
good,"Long history of profit, currently feeling competitive pressures in a changing marketplace. Strong professional workforce. Recent management changes have been announced as earnings have missed expectations in recent earnings releases."
good,"My working days were never boring, I always had something to do, and it was always productive for the company. Everything that needs to be done is written on a list and you are expected to get everything done on time. The management was pretty flexible, but sometimes I wish they could've been a little more understanding at times. My co-workers were friendly to be around and helped me with things if time was running out. The hardest part of the job was Finding certain products on account of the store being so big. The most enjoyable part of the job was a satisfactory feeling after helping a customer."
good,This is a place that if you show heart it will give it back in full. I was lucky to have some strong backboned managment over the weaker ones. I have found even the worst of jobs can be great with the right management supporting you and I had a few that did. The work is non stop as in always something to do or someone to help which helps the hours go by. The job is truly what you make it as long as you have the right people supporting you.
good,Very busy place to work but fun to work at an I learned a lot working their  I would go back an work for Lowe's at a different location
good,I enjoy working with my co-worker they help me get the task in hand done plus it helps to have a good relationship with the people you work with I think
good,"A typical day can be upbeat and fun, usually though it is slow. There is a lot of lifting, moving around and helping people find things. You do learn a lot on the job and everyone is super friendly and nice. Management is quick to resolve issues or concerns. Hardest part about this job is all the lifting. It does give you a nice work out and I enjoyed it. Other than that my only other cons were the hours. Sometimes you be closing the stores than opening it right back up. That got a little rough."
good,Pretty good place to work. Lowes benefits are great. Seasonal employment gave a lot of chances for overtime. Hard to get in a permanent position after seasonal though.
good,I had nothing but good luck with Lowe's as a whole they were very understanding of what you as an employee needs such as time off or sickness comes up or family emergency they early say no if you need time off and are very friendly as bosses and or supervisor I would recommend Lowe's to anyone who wants to move up based on their work ethic and professionalism.
good,"Management doesn't support the workers when a customer challenges policy but those not in management are amazing people. The store manager does just that, manage. He puts in no work to better his relationship with the associates"
good,"A typical work day varies on the position. Admins are busier than most. There are more details for them to pay attention to. I have learned a lot about myself and my abilities to multitask. My management style has changed, but for the better. I am a stronger leader and can work with any personality. My co-workers are great and supportive. This is not always true at every location.The hardest part of my job is the time management of 60 hour work weeks and sometimes seeing the vision the company has for itself. The most enjoyable part if my job is the admin role I have and the amount or wonder people I have met along the way. My brain works really well with the admin responsibilities. The past six years I have developed great friendships across the country."
good,"Over all I can not complain about my time with Lowe's. It truly is a great company to work for. I spent 11 years with Lowe's and made some life long friends along with moving cross country. I have nothing bad to say about Lowe's, I worked hard and was greatly awarded for my hard work. Now that I have a family, it's a bit harder to work the long hours as an Assistant Store Manger."
good,Great place to work but  managers come and go because the company's views constantly change the company is big on evolving the stores connect like family but the vision constantly changes
good,"Manager let's you do as you please,picks favorites. No paid lunches only managers get benefits no room for advancement"
good,Working at Lowe's wasn't such of a hard job I've been the type of person to be fast paste. Doing everything that's listed and achieving my goals also helping others with theirs.
good,"Great place to work if you want to move up the ladder quickly."
good,Lowes offers quite a lot and depending on how good your management is you can advance to many other things. A lot of times the work load can be stressful or if they are short handed you will have to deal with all the excess work.
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for with lots of opportunities to learn new skills and attributes.  There are a variety of opportunities that the company offers if an individual is looking to move up to management or to learn a new department.  The people within the company are great, and the management is solid too.  The hardest part of the job is the inconsistency of the days and hours the company requires each employee to work.  Twice a month the company requires 6 consecutive days of work with only one day off and only one weekend off a month.  As a student and a young adult I still value having the consistent free time to work on school and network with friends, family, and colleagues. Overall the company is a great company to work for, being in a more relaxed atmosphere helping customers love where they live makes the job interesting at times which helps me proactively learn to solve new issues on a daily basis."
good,"Lowes is Lowes, it's retail, you deal with rude and arrogant customers often. But it can be fun when surrounded by fun coworkers"
good,"Good working conditions, excellent team at all job levels. Had great relationship with manager and received constant encouragement."
good,"I really like and enjoy my job, my co-workers are all really nice and cool. (compared to my last job way way too much negative energy you never wanted to be there).  Sometimes I get excited to go to work."
good,"Supportive Management, fun place to work,  Personal growth "
good,Very busy with with short staff. A lot of multitasking is needed. The pay is fair and there are a lot of employee incentives
good,My schedule was worked around my busy life. Friendly co-workers and it was easy to work the register. It was hard working outside in the heat by they had fans to cool us down. I loved working with the customers.
good,Lowe's has excellent benefits and pays very well. there is room to move up with the company. Customers are allowed to walk all over you.
good,"I will start by saying the schedule will be something you might want to know about before you apply for any job at Lowes .Personally I didn't have any problems with my co-workers very easy to get along with and always tried to work as a team. The management was good for the most part, the guy who ran my department was great can't say anything bad about the guy, store management different story went from a great store manger to a lousy one. It's a very physically demanding job but I liked who I worked with which made everyday seem to fly by. It was hard for me to leave because of the people I loved working with."
good,Typical day at Lowes was at least a 11 hour day with the daily learning. Enjoyed being able to teach what I was able to learn on a daily basis.
good,Working for Lowes was a great environment and productive company. I enjoyed working with my co-workers because they were all team players as well as myself. I learned a lot working for the company enough to challenge myself and do greater thing in the future for myself in hopes to one day own my own business.
good,"as a csa your main objective is freight and providing solutions for customers. YOu will have to learn how to operate different power equipment, and how to use the impact model."
good,"Staff get along very well, and the benefits are great. Ability to move around and improve on skills through out the company."
good,"My job as a appliance specialist not only included sales of the merchandise, but also in some cases ordering the merchandise from the manufacture.I had to be certain that the product fit the customers requirements,such as size of the product, or that it would fit in certain in a certain space. Being that I was the first contact for the customer it made sense that I would be the last. If their was a problem with the product as far as damage , price discrepancy, or even a refund I was the person to contact. If we did carry the merchandise, I would also recommend another source to purchase merchandise."
good,"Lowe's has helped me alot in the long run, especially when my dad became sick and passed. I love my schedule. i get to spend my weekends with my son. I like to do all the necessary paperwork, I like to be organized."
good,The company as a whole is wonderful. They offer great benefits and incentives. The technology of the company has definitely improved over the 10 years of being with this company.
good,"Good company to learn management and home building process"
good,this was a great place to work. lots of cool and fun people to be around.totally fun managers to work for.lots of departments to work in. whatever you have a interest in you can make it here
good,"Great Health care, and they give back to the community through there hero's project. Has great customer that come in on a daily basis."
good,A typical day at Lowe's was come into work check LRT gun and equipment assigned to you out. My job right off the bat was to check for any kind of damage or faulty equipment to potentionally prevent a future accident. Next i would need to see what job i had been assigned to for that day and allot of times i did multiple jobs in a day due to all my expirence and good work ethics. I would than go right to work only stopping for the occasional bathroom breaks. i worked from 6 am to 4:30 pm four days a week and lowe's has a strict no quit or park equipment tell 20 after. My most enjoyable part of working at lowe's would have to be all the manual labor i really enjoy to be moving and staying active all day.
good,The hardest part of the job is getting the other associates to cooperate with you. Other than that its not bad and the pay is good for retail.
good,"The hardest part is working customer service, but its so fast pace that it makes the day go by faster. It gives you something to do all the time because you are constantly multi tasking."
good,"Cashiering"
good,"I loved this job because I learned so much, working in just about every department store wide. Customer service was my main focus. The only downfall to this job was the cutting back of set hours."
good,"The managers can't seem to get breaks out at the right times, you would always have to stay extra time over because they can't get you out on time."
good,"I enjoyed working here. I liked Management as well as my colleagues. Unfortunately I wasn't getting the hours I needed to support myself and my son, so therefore had to look for a better opportunity."
good,"A typical day would be assisting customers with checkouts, as well as loading items, helping customers find things, and making them feel welcome within the store. "
good,"I love my job in the first 9 months or so. Management was great, flexible and honest. Once our management changed the culture of the store changed for the worse."
good,"Daily work varied depending on assignments. "
good,"fast pace, fun, busy, lots of hands on work. you can learn alot of stuff in a short amount of time with help from others"
good,As a head cashier you have a lot of duties from dealing with costumer complaints to helping out other departments I worked at lowes in elizabethton when it first opened and I am sure things have changed but it wasn't that busy in the store and the management didn;t understand that when your child is in the hospital you will miss work to be with them that is why I left
good,carry a very hectic work schedule duties intended for a least two people. training is not productive with lack of direct employees support. Store level employees are great to work around positive attitudes and great customer service.
good,"My days are mostly boring.  I get to work and take care of payroll.  After that I spend most of my day wondering what I'll do.  Some times I have interviews, but mostly it's taking care of little things that only take a few minutes like filing, processing status changes through PeopleSoft, or positing newly open positions."
good,i liked working with the people but the managment and myself did not work out together
good,I learned a lot working for Lowe's. I progressed from a seasonal cashier to department manager fairly quickly. I would have stayed with the company had they not needed to downsize the management at the store level.
good,estimating and selling of building materials.  I learned it depends on who you are.  Certain people can get away with things that others can not.  Most co-workers were great to work with.  but others took all the glory even for what you did.  dealing with unhappy people. the most enjoyable part was helping people bring their dreams to light.
good,"Lowe's is a great company.  Very ""relationship"" driven. I met some great people that are truly interested in my success."
good,"The hardest part and the most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the general public. Most customers are friendly and glad that you are there to help them. However, some customers are easily angered and difficult to handle. "
good,A great place to work. 10 hour work days. Work discounts. Management is all was there to help. Games to play on brake. Work is strait forward.
good,"On opening shifts the first thing that needs to be done is to place all the return transaction receipts in order and note the receipts that are missing so that they can be reprinted. Our loading tickets from the previous day need to be placed in order as well and noted what information is missing (ie. customer signature or employee initials). When that is turned in, I have to be the Customer service desk associate as well as the phone operator. Most of the time I am scheduled a full 8 hour shift alone so I have to be the return desk associate as well. "
good,Managers were great. Just was shocked to know that I was going to be laid off.
good,"The most important thing I learned was how to sell, but It is time to move into the finance/business field."
good,Lowes was great to work for as they worked with my availability (this was a second job).  I worked as a weekend returns merchandise clerk or a cashier (depending on where they needed me).
good,I go to work and help my associates with freight then I assist customers. As a manager I give my associates sales goes and help them with any tasks that I give them. I do counts daily to check inventory quantity.
good,"Adequate culture, solid leadership, perhaps slightly below market-value pay structure."
good,"Overall, Lowe's is a good company to work for.  They provide excellent benefits to their employees and have various locations all over the United States."
good,"Its a good company, the management can make it tough at times."
good,The hardest part was dealing with fellow employees and managers who didnt know how to communicate in a proper manner
good,"not enough training for the managers. But, over all it was a great customer service builder."
good,Assist customer with color selection. Work at customer service. Process credit apps. Fill internet orders. Telephone operator. Process returns. Rent out carpet cleaners. Process sales at the cash register.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's in home decor department is cutting blinds, helping customers with any and every questions, and putting in orders such as estimates, installations and special orders."
good,"Most work shifts would require 8 hours, and sometimes require you to work in a department your not familiar with due to the fact the company does not want to pay for extra employees working in the departments, which then makes customers complain that their is no associates around to help with them. Work atmosphere is fantastic."
good,Enjoyed helping people find what they where looking for . Always went above and beyond to help out companys.
good,"While at Lowe's, I learned to assist a wide variety of customers needing assistance in many different areas of the store. The store offered a great opportunity to learn many different skills and products, as well as enhancing customer service abilities. Typical days had me assisting customers, ordering product, training/assisting other associates, and checking products counts, among other things. The job provided new and exciting challenges as I progressed up the ladder, with the only real obstacles being associates who were unwilling to learn more to assist in the store and a lack of communication amongst managers to be more efficient in getting the job done."
good,"I only was there for a short time, but I had a great time. I learned more about sales.   the management team and the other people I worked with were a lot of fun, and the only thing  about working there that I wasnt crazy about was working late"
good,customer service. I learned all departments so when a customer came up to me i could answer the question. mangement changed over alot. Hardest part was realizing the pay wasnt that good. I love to put on my A game at all times because when the employees would come in morning shift and see what was done from the nightshift the reward was when i seen the appreciation in there eyes
good,"Ok, it very busy time usually goes by fast. Some workers work and other dont of they dont do they work they ususlaly dont get in trouble and the managers really dont cares beacuse no one gets fired only of they are stealing."
good,I love working there. Every body is great to work with. management  has their moments most of the time the are very friendly.   the hardest part of the job is dealing with some of the customers.
good,"Good Working Environment, friendly associates, management was fair in all aspects."
good,I really enjoyed working at Lowe's.  The interactions with customers and co-workers were the most enjoyable part of the job.  I learned to make sales add-on sales.
good,"Lowe's home improvement is a great place to work for, management is very flexible and laid back, and the people you work with make it all that much more worth the while."
good,A typical day at Lowes is good or great. The co workers are knowledgable and fun to be with. There is always something new to learn and lots of physical lifting
good,"Over all I loved my job. The customers were great, and some of the other associates were great to. The job is flexible, and the money is good, it could have been managed better though."
good,"A lot of customer service. Decent pay, just got to hard to work that many hours and finish school work."
good, 
good,"Be the first one their to fill the tills with money."
good,The rorating schedule is hard on family life. Frequently work a closing shift until 11 PM and come back to open at 6 AM. No matter how much vacation you have accrued you can only take nine days at a time.
good,"very hard to work with school schedule, not flexible with scheduling."
good,"A typical day at work is running a cash register and loading various heavy items such as mulch, or patio stones into customers cars."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the customers. Management was fair.
good,"Again, typical retail. These people aren't college scholars or anything, but they're still good people. The work space is as clean as you want it to be. It's a male dominated corp so beware of that. Yes, your intelligence suffers quite a bit."
good,"I would show customers where products were regardless of the department the items were. I also operated a forklift to grab products for customers from shelves on racks. The management there was pretty awesome. My co-workers were aweomse as well. The hardest part about this job was trying to get enough hours to pay bills, as I was only part time. The most enjoyable part about this job was the friendly environment."
good,"Commercial Sales, managing and cultivating corperate accounts and establishing credit for such accounts"
good,"In the mornings there is nothing to do and time seems to stand still. Plenty of work to be done during a shift. Learned not to express intelligent concerns about daily operations because it is their way or the highway. Management, some were very nice and understanding, others its like pulling teeth."
good,"Typical days at work included helping customers find what kind of lawnmower or BBQ grill they would like. The management was very inconsistent, except one manager with whom I respected very much, and with whom i loved to work. I kept to myself a good bit and only spoke to a handful of my coworkers, they were nice enough, but I didn't know them too well. The most enjoyable part of the job was the 15 minute breaks we were allotted."
good,"Fantastic crew, hard working men and women. Management changed very often, no consistency. Poor management, lacked knowledge, lead with blind eyes. No room for advancement, only based off favoritism, hard workers lost out on many advancement opportunities."
good,co-workers are great people but I would like a more professional experience
good,Work was easy to assemble projects and learned various parts and sku #.
good,"Lowe's is an enjoyable place to work for persons willing to accept the changing challenges of day-to-day activities. Lowe's is attempting at present to establish a divide between it competitors by implementing new technology, such as, the MyLowes Card with the hopes of creating more reasons for its customers to return to shop again."
good,"A typical day at work i arrived at work greeted with two other co workers working on the same shift, the work shift varied from 8-4, 12-8 with the a lunch break i got along with all of my co workers i learned many new things about the pharmacy and all the prescription drugs i developed good relationship with regular customers the hardest part of the job was sometimes during the busy times within the day there was not enough staff on a shift"
good,Lowe's is a very good company to work with. Many of the employees are very nice and they have very good benefits for full time employees.
good,train employees on OHSA safety saving company money. report writing hazmat compliance. review closed cirect TV. for any issues.
good,"A typical day as a Project Coordinator for Kitchen Prjoects varys every day. Everytime the phone rings you encounter new and different issues to resolve. However, once you complete a project with the customer you have a feeling of satisfaction and take ownership in the work that you have done to assist the customer in their remodel."
good,While working at Lowes there was always a chance to learn about products in every division. The management made sure that their employees got the chance for any advancement in the company. The staff in the location I worked in were like family and we all got along great. There really were no hard parts of the job to speak of.
good,"lowes is just like any other sales job but they do pay well and the benefits are good, there is plenty of room for advancement."
good,unload trucks of inventory stocking material 3rd shift night receiving
good,"You will always find something to do whether its answer a phone call, clean the store, stock shelves, replace price tags, help customers on the floor."
good,"Great when it comes to advancement, they compensate well based on experience, but management does not hold people accountable. Typical retail mentality of ""protect our bonus, then take care of the customer""."
good,"8 hour shifts to include customer service, assisting employees with work issues/benefit issues/payroll, and handling conflict with customers. I learned how to become a manager and learned what your employees expect from their management team. I learned fairness and responsibilty. The hardest part of my job would probably have to be handling upset customers in a way that followed company policy but also satified the customer. Our management team could benefit from consistency and better communication. I enjoy my job because of my co-workers and the teamwork that we share."
good,"This company was enjoyable to work for because they believed the customer is important. We approached each and every person in our area asking what we can do for them. If a customer is looking for a specific item, we researched and found the item or one to their satisfaction. The company believed in cross training, so no matter what time of day or evening, someone is knowledgeable enough to assist the customer. Not only did I receive training for my department, but, I trained to cover the front-end of the store. The hardest part for me would be having to use some of the equipment that functioned in the air."
good,I learned a lot about home projects and do it yourself projects and I learned how to deal with many different kinds of personalities.
good,This job requires heavy lifting on a daily basis. I have learned alot about people since I work with the public. My co workers are hard reliable workers and good to work with. The hardest part of this job is lifting appliances into the truck and delivering them to customers and then unloading the appliances and placing them into the customers homes.
good,"To enjoy working for Lowe's really depends on the store you work in. If I were rating my previous Lowe's store, I would give everything five stars. Management and Staff was very friendly and encouraging. People loved each other as family, mostly because when you work at Lowe's full-time, you are there all the time and associates become more than just associates. At my old store, Management gave you opportunities to grow with the company and move up."
good,Great place if you like working with people. Great customer service. Company offers good benefits. Schedule is always flexible.
good,"Lowes has a definite home feeling to it, the pay is exceptional for retail, and they have excellent HR."
good,"This company was quite interesting to work for, I met some interesting customers in this job and I loved them. Most of the managers weren't too bad to work with, but the head Manager at my store was very understanding. But if you work P/T your hours go up and down like a yo yo. If your on the Front End make sure you always attend your meetings other wise you get wrote up for it. Than finally make sure before you leave the company make sure your boss received your notice."
good,"A typical workday at lowes would be opening and taking care of opening duties, making sure all the customers needs are met. The hardest part of the job is finding something to do for hours. The most enjoyable was interacting with customers. the culture of the job i didn't really understand at first but then i understood that the customers and safety was the best part of the job."
good,Over all experience there was a great 1. I learned about a subject that I really had no knowledge of from someone who's an expert. The customers and employees are really nice for the most part. I did not however feel support from my management team When I needed it the most. It took one person to tell vicious lies about me and I was out of a job. Crushed  My self esteem . It gave me an opportunity to go to a something horrible without completely giving up. On the road to recovery
good,"Everyone at Lowes was amazing and nice, however the hours were harsh and unchanging. Stocking was unpredictable and sometimes there would be no freight and therefore, no work."
good,Lowes pays very well. The job can get a bit stressful. But it has a lot of opportunities. Working here has taught me to be very patience and more understanding towards the customers.
good,Working at was lowes was real good meeting new people everyday was diffrent with deliverys meeting time frames talking to customers making sure deliverys were delivered safe and the drive time was cool from driving out of town to in city deliverys
good,I work the night shift. Managers always on your neck won’t let you breathe it’s a horrible experience. The job is an easy thing to do but the mission is staying.
good,Working at Lowes is a fun and entertaining experience.  The company truly cares for their workers and their well- being. The management at me particular store are very understanding when unforeseen circumstances come up.
good,"They are flexible to work for. They will work to accommodate you with any specific needs you may have from time to time.A typical day includes catering to customers needs, stocking, answer technical questions in person and on the phone.The hardest part of the job is the schedule."
good,"It was a good seasonal job and I learned a lot with home improvement while working there. They have great benefits, and the management care about there employees."
good,Great job for guys who want to go to the construction business the job helps you learn about the construction side of stuff and you meet people who have experience on the construction side
good,"Overall nice place to work. People are nice. Management is mostly good, competent. We have a few terrible managers but there's enough good to outweigh the bad for now. Be a hard-working, responsible person if you want to succeed. There's lot's to do but not enough resources."
good,Lowe's is a company focused on growing with many good people working for it.  Job security is not good causing many employees to constantly worry about their future with nonstop reorgs. This was once a great company that is more focused on achieving financial goals than employee and customer goals.  There is a new group of leaders there now that I can only hope change the path and put employees and customers first.
good,Every day is a challege and there has been alot of changes. Advancements rarely happen to those who been with lowes for a long time. You always keep store clean even if buzy.
good,Good place to work in the summer until it's time for the kids to go back to school  and then that's when your hours get cut may it be part-time or full-time. If management doesn't like you then your stay is short.
good,This was my first time to work for a large corporation. It was a change for me due to my previous jobs. I had several very helpful coworkers and department managers that were fantastic at helping me learn the processes and procedures. I am grateful to have had the experiences that I had in that unfamiliar environment.
good,"Ok place to work, except that top out pay is less than 18 dollars and your management team doesnt address the issues. Computer technology is ancient, system is convoluted and hard to understand. Almost no chance to improve or move up."
good,I actually really like lowes. They treat me well. Staffing is really bad though. I work at a desk and there is never any coverage. I do really like management for the most part.
good,Lowes fosters an environment of learning and productivity. They are great at rewarding safety and proper working practices. They also have great program for advancement.
good,Good company to work for. Definetly has its pros and cons like any other job but overall a good work enviorement. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful.
good,"Its good for a temp job, but you are on your feet the whole shift. They allow you an hour lunch, but its not paid. Management for the most part does not help with customer service but expects you to go out of your way to stretch yourself thin to do all that they require you to do."
good,It is a fun place to work despite the fact that they dont hire enough people to fill crucial positions and they divide the task among employees rather than fill the positions
good,great people to work with. management always breathing down your neck and your co-workers are quick to throw you under the bus. deal with a lot of people. great benefits. even if you're in your own position and have your own work to do they want you to do everyone else work too
good,"This job is more for the hard working employee, dedicated to helping every customer. Respect is key as a employee and coworker in a hectic environment. Everyone rely's on the departments to get the job done, and make the day go by faster."
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for as far as pay. Be prepared to do work that is outside of your department and daily job duties. "
good,"Freight comes in, on delivery trucks, at varied times of the day,. Same supplier / vendors, so rapport is good for work relationships. Management is supportive of my actions, decisions, and customer service and help skills. the personal culture and relationship between associates is very friendly, and management seeks to kindle better than boss and employee relationships, everyone acts as family members"
good,Work day required by completing  a multitude of task that need to be done by end of shift.I learned to multi task and learn to validate. Tasks and assignments that were assigned. Work place culture is of a family atmosphere. Hardest part of job is getting everything done in one way. Most enjoyable is working with customers and taking care of employees.
good,Loved the coworkers couldn't deal with the inconsistency of the schedule. Hardest part of the job is the evening rush and not having enough employees on the sales floor and on the front end.
good,I loved until I moved to mt. Veiew store... Poeple hated me because I made them work and they couldnt stand around like other managers let them do in the past
good,"Working at Lowe's can definitely be work environment to learn about all kind of things, being that there are many departments (plumbing, electrical, building materials etc. )"
good,"While working there it was fun, but it had a lot of times when a manager was making me do things I wasn't qualified to do. Overall one manager was bad the rest was easy going and fun."
good,you should move heavy things and stock down product. they have rotate  schedule which is not suitable for me.good manager and training . it is not good for student because of rotating
good,Overall the job is pretty cool. It’s not a 2-3 man job. It can suck when managers complain with very little to no experience of what your day actually consist of. As long as you have workers you’re going to be fine.
good,"This has been a learning lesson for me. I much prefer a warehouse. You break your back for low pay and overtime is a crime. The people are great, but the pay for the work isn't worth it."
good,"Working outside was a great experience, I learned a lot about certain plants, garden soil and dirt.  Received my counterbalanced forklift license, order picker license, reach truck license."
good,"I used to be a CSA Cashier, there is not much room to grow they rather prefer give a position to someone outside than someone inside the company, saw lots of managers that because of their positions there friends and family took the positions available and when you asked they only tell you there is no availability, hope they have fix that issue, you can get old working for the companyband will be possibly in same position. Working in a retail store is common been busy special in holidays and change of seasons. I used to love my job but move on looking for better job opportunities. Missed my days at Lowes knew lot of people and learned a lot."
good,Working for Lowes it's very demanding and stressful. But helping customers is a fun way to keep you out of stress and a good way to learn different products in the store
good,"Good company to be a part of, if I had to mention a weakness it would be management and staffing. Staffing seems to be a constant struggle, we are a high volume store and it would be nice to have more help available to please our customers."
good,Moving all around at Lowe’s is great learning so much about working and life things! It’s a great place for benefits and job stabilization. Moving up is always the goal for me!
good,Lowe's is a good place to work.  I worked there for 14 years.  I've been in Loss prevention for 24 years.  I enjoyed working for Lowe's.  Good benefits
good,I was a college student while working with Lowe's and I would work on the weekend team to make some extra cash while going to BBCC for System Administration. If you want something not too difficult with plenty of advancement opportunity and easy to please customers this job is great for you!
good,"good place, not enough employees for the work required. I have worked there for 2 years and the environment as well as culture are great. Personally I do not believe it is a high enough pay for a career."
good,if you are looking for a first time job this is the a good place to work they offer good pay and for the most part everyone there is friendly and helpful.
good,Really high pace work Environment. Fun but could be stressful at times. I really enjoy working with people and getting to know each other. My work experience at lowes was really positive.  I feel I have out grown my position that lows.
good,"the employees are very helpful when needed and the managers are as well. their training programs a little too long but helpful for those who have never had a job before. they have great benefits and and loads of opportunities at your disposal even for seasonal hires. Everyone is treated equally, or at least they make you feel that your worth something, that your important and its refreshing to feel good about going to work on a Monday with a smile or any day. Overall I feel that Lowes is a great environment to have a stable job at and a wonderful place to start."
good,didn't spend enough time at Lowes to call it a career it was rewarding and the pay was fair at the time I really enjoyed the people I worked with at the time
good,You are treat with respect at all time fellow employer was great to work with everything was a team work even the customer was great..................
good,no more commission jobs. all jobs at lowes are hourly no incentive to sell more product. but management works very hard sets a great example for the store.
good,Never enough help to do what needs to be done. It just roles over to the next day. Or you dread your days off because it's going to be there when you come back just worse.
good,"I was hired at Loews on condition of an approved background check.  I was a star csr. After a month and a half of working there,  I was terminated for my background. It didn't matter that my performance was over the top,  without any warning,  I was just terminated."
good,"Sometimes it was a great place to work, when you had great co workers that kept up with the work and also were responsible  and reliable. The best was the scheduling. It was flexiable and I was able to work just the hours that my kids were in school."
good,"Lowe's is by far a great place, I was laid off but enjoyed all my time there with my coworkers and all the people you meet and create professional bond with"
good,"Working at lowe's has it's ups and downs but lowe's does tries to show you that you matter. There are times when you have cut throat people always trying to take your spot, so you have to stand fast and be strong to achieve everything/anything you want."
good,Under payed for lots of hard work if they paid receiving and unload  better people whould stay longer. Grate work environment and very friendly people and management!
good,Lowe's went ok very laid back and easy going for me. Although i did not know much about the different departments but it was easy. I hated working there tho they collect  a lot of dust so be on the look out for that. It cause your skin to itch really bad.
good,I worked at Lowes for six years and in all that time I could only talk to one of the many managers. After getting injured on the job the managers worked real hard to make me want to quit.
good,Overall a great company to work for. Other associates were great and maintained good attitudes. But they are understaffed and will always promise you help but they will not deliver on that promise. Will miss the associates.
good,"This wasn't a place i'd want to stay for a long time, but for a short term job Lowe's was perfect. Management and co-workers were great. It's a easy job and there is always something to do."
good,Not a Bad place to work. Labor intensive Hot in the summer 
good,"The season determines your workload, during the summer, lawn & garden and home improvements are very busy. During the winter plumbing and applaince are busy."
good,"Lowes is a good place to work, Lowes has a great benefits and a 401K package."
good,"Great location (2 miles from home); assistant managers were fair, though some were lazy; the store manager was one-sided and unbalanced; coworkers were okay for the most part."
good,"So the work is fast-paced and the people you work with are genuinely nice. As with any retail job, the day to day grind of giving a good customer experience while taking care of your other responsibilities can be a chore. But, usually it was a pleasant experience. "
good,"Company was great for the first 20 years, after that the value of  the employees was questionable, it seemed. The corporate office was spectacular and to be part of a large company was fantastic."
good,"Enjoyed this job for the most part. the house i was scheduled were very inconsistent, for example they would have me close one night and open the very next day, which would get tiring. the environment was great and I loved my staff."
good,"From a cashier's perspective, it was exciting to meet so many people every day. I learned that I enjoy working with people and helping them with something they may struggle with but I am good at, such as how to build a chain-link fence, or what materials are needed to build DIY projects like a bunk bed."
good,"While the work is easy, the people are friendly and it is a moderately safe place to work, the ""coaches"" tend to just sit around with their thumbs in the darkness.  These same coaches then come and complain about numbers not being met and people not doing their jobs...yet, what do they do?  Continue to hide behind their desk, playing on a computer and talking their shift away."
good,"You don't stop all day, but have a sense of accomplishment when you leave. Willing to promote within before posting jobs, culture is competitive and you have to deal w/ the public, which can be frustrating."
good,"It only takes one bad manager to mess up everything!!!! They do not get rid of bad employees, you have to put up with them even if they get promoted and want to make a name for them self."
good,"Working at lowes is great, the people are amazing, they care about your well being, and we have work celebrations for safety, but the fairfax location unfortunately cut down so 50% of the managers we laid off. It was a big hit and I feel like the people who got to stay were the ones sucking up to the higher up managers. And because of the cut down, a lot of those people were poorly trained and they were making wrong decisions. But you can pick your health care, and  all other stuff. get  1 hour lunch depends on how much you work. and we help the community a lot too."
good,"Lowes is a great company to work for. There is always a chance for promotion and its very pet friendly. Lowes works as a team and always help Lowes employees with any problem they may have weither its a car problem or a family problem they always try to help "
good,Daily routine of job duties was consistent and directions were clear. Great and friendly co workers. Management was always very helpful. Work and personal life balance was great.
good,"Good place to work if you like being cashier, not my place dontnkike standing around for hours. Other then that people who work there are so cool. The head cashiers are so nice"
good,A lot of change nay happen due to the constant change of the retail market trying to keep up with competitors. It's a retail job in a warehouse setting.
good,Great place to work but is slightly biased when it comes to advancing as a women in a mans workplace. The work culture is very rich with amazing co workers but management can be very touchy.
good,"Management is ok, no overly friendly.  People love to gossip.  I do not enjoy going to work because you don't know what kind of mood your supervisor will be in."
good,"Great people work here, the management is tough sometimes but nothing to crazy. Great working a 4 day work week with 3 days off. Good health coverage."
good,"I love my job, it is such satisfying work. I have learned so much in such a short amount of time. But the management team leaves a lot to be desired. There is no communication and no accountability for their actions. The hardest part of my job is basically having so much responsibility for just being a regular associate. The best part of my job is definitely my hours."
good,"●	Friendly and Speedy Customer Service"
good,"great working at the store with other employees, but management wanted u to do three jobs. no help with customers when needed. heavy work loads, not fun to work atmostphere"
good,"I enjoy my job at Lowe's but my position was eliminated. I love the family environment, and the customers. I would loved to have retired from Lowe's but that doesn't seem like an option as they are getting rid of full time positions to replace them with part time."
good,Being in a $56mill store it is always fast pace.  The company has slowed the pace of stores opening but really done a nice job of updating is tech.
good,it is good place to work. I loved it but I am looking for better place to make more money. Also I want to get experience on different field and find a job toward my education.
good,good company but dealing with troubled times making positions very insecure at this time!!! Still very fair to associates and very fair pay.
good,It was a fun place to work. Management was friendly and competent. The pay was garbage though and benefits were a joke. Very anti-union as well. Good employee discount.
good,"Average, I have worked for both Lowes Home Improvement and Home Depot. I think is a better company to work for on a whole. I believe that Lowes and do a better job providing for their employees and more importantly their community,"
good,"I worked in the bakery department as a closer. So I took care of customers by my self, got bake goods ready to be baked in the morning, and clean the bakery. It was hard doing this job by my self. I think I work better as a team member then working by my self. The management was great and they really worked with my college schedule."
good,"Able to teach the associates merchandising."
good,"Lowe's is a fast paced environment. The managers are generally nice and caring. I enjoy the assisting of the customers, helping them make their house their home."
good,"A typical day at work is always different. Some days involve inventory, while other days I move boxes. It is really hot in the summer time and really cold in the winter inside the center. Co-workers are great, make the job worthwhile. Management is always changing it up. Have to be able to change with the rules. Hardest part of the job is the actual physical labor."
good,This is a nice job.. I enjoyed working on projects.   The job require you to work a lot of holidays because the store is always open.. I also can receive quarterly bonus if the store performs well every quarter.
good,"Lowe's is a good place to be employed.  The work is extremely physically demanding, but the environment is very friendly and both the management and employees are very proud of the work they do there.  They take pride in their safety, efficiency, and service.  Lowe's has a wonderful open door policy that makes it very comfortable for any employee to approach anyone at any level up to and including the Operations manager.  It is a great place to get experience in a wide variety of job functions from the operation of industrial equipment to being trained in hazardous materials."
good,"The hardest part of my job is that you're working with the general public and anyone that works with general public knows what I'm talking about. But honestly, I work with some of the kindest most giving people and I have learned a in the short time that I have been there."
good,"A typical day at work is sorting and stocking merchandise for retail."
good,Great company to work for but advancement opportunities were in the hands of coaches. Which did not allow me to advance as I would have liked to.
good,Lowe's is an excellent company to work because of the family atmosphere. They need new equipment for the employees such as pallet jacks and personal protection equipment.
good,"worked for 20yrs, lot of employees were there for a long period we worked well together, great benefits. Bonus when we made numbers, some good managers"
good,Easy work with little reward. Good management. This job taught me patience. Young co-workers. Job comes with rude customers and poor hours. 'young/fun place to work.
good,This is a great place to work. Most employees are easy to get along with and very helpful. Decent benefits and yearly raises.
good,"Pay is good depending on your experience for the position applied for. Good benefits, medical, profit sharing, 401k."
good,"my colleagues was the most enjoyable part of my job.as the third year came by,there was a lot of variety in what I did each day. ranging from monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting."
good,Overall good company and going thru a lot of transition.  Unclear direction given to managers and what to focus on. The most enjoyable part of job is working with community.
good,Help customer's find what they need in the store.  Estimate the material's needed to build there projects. I also run a register to help the check out process go faster.
good,I enjoy working at Lowes but I am looking for something with more stable hours with career advancement. Traveling would be ideal for me. I enjoy working with my co workers . The best part of my job is knowing that I am able to satisfy customers with their purchases.
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in, hopping on register in the front, garden or lumber area. Depending on shift, lunch break 4-5 hours in, 15 minute break 2-3 hours in. I pretty much refined my cashier and customer service skills. Co-workers were great, management were cool. Hardest part of the job would probably be when a customer brings an item up with no bar code or when your shift is short staffed so you have to service long lines. Not too bad, however. Most enjoyable part of the job is when they feed their employees. They have had a cookout on memorial day, chik fil a catering, water ice/pretzels etc. in the past."
good,"Manu people were customer friendly, yet lacked hard construction experience on a trade school level & general contractor field experience on installation. No formal basic knowledge on how material interact & combine to set the finish project to operational usage for the consumer & builder."
good,It is a decent company to work for as there are tons of positions that you can get into. Hard to learn all of the products though and where everything is. Was a temp and was laid off due to the color of my skin. All other seasonal employees were hired on full time except me which seemed kind of odd.
good,Leading a team to capture forecast goal with a low payroll budget. Review weekly reports to determine opportunities. If you have a good management team you can be successful.
good,"My typical day at work includes making the store look grand-opening ready every day, providing excellent customer service, taking care of customer issues."
good,"Management not always supportive of employees. Management is often trying to get two men work out of one person. Benefits are okay and they have decent 401k. No overtime but that can mean they keep you longer one day then make you cut time at lunch or end of shift another day. There usualy is chance for advancement, but it may feel like more of a burden."
good,"I provide excellence customer service. I learn new things every day. help customers with items they are looking for. work in Returns. "
good,im speaking from flooring i was a specialist and if the help was there then it was a fun department even though everything was heavy it bareable
good,"Great people, unfortunately everything is seasonal, pay is ok for the area, advancement is possible as long as you work hard, great with breaks, always busy/steady, personal time they were great about, vacations, staff is great, my only issue was with the human resource rep because she gave me the wrong info about becoming a permanent employee, they only offer part time even if hired as fulltime seasonal."
good,"Contractor and project oriented sales team focused on opening and growing commercial accounts. Contractor sales representatives are open to build commercial accounts in all product lines within the store, associates can find success in any niche."
good,The job can be both rewarding and challenging which is what I like about it.  Throughout my tenure I have learned different aspects of the retail world and customer service that I know will prove helpful in the future.  My co-workers are great and we have a strong management team.
good,"Expect to work hard or don't apply. Being a Hardware Warehouse you should expect heavy lifting, customer service, and power equipment."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy while having one to three tasks going at once. I have learned that customer service is most important. Management can be improved in regards to training, favoritism and morale. My co-workers are excellent and I enjoy being a part of the garden center. The hardest part of the job is lifting 50 lbs of product and not having support in the department when needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing customer service and being outside."
good,Lowes is great place to work wonderful benefits.  I was a cashier and at my store one of the head cashier degrades and humiliates the cashiers.weeks would go by and we had no breaks after standing on our feet for 7 hours. management has a no care attitude. management allowed customers to call cashiers derogatory names the only good thing about this store is the benefits and my co workers
good,Customer service and working as a cashier. I have learned a great deal in how to interact at customer service. The management is great and very good to get along with.
good,Working for this company requires a person that has lots of patience with customer related issues and at times with unbalance coworkers. The store is constantly short staffed due to hours getting cut back so employees have the responsibility of taking on multiply jobs. The general vibe of the store I work at is calm among the employees and is a pleasure to work with some.
good,"Arrived at work daily, pulled products ,uncrated and inspected for damage .Routed deliveries  and called customers and gave 2 hour window of delivery. Enjoyed dealing with customers daily, learned to appreciate and give back in positive attitude. Respected decisions made by management. Enjoyed working with other drivers. Hardest part of job not knowing what time I would be home at end of day for family time when leaving home. Most enjoyable part of job making customers day by delivering new appliance."
good,You learn a lot. Having to do many task at the same time. Need to be on you toes at all times. never know whats going to happen
good,"unloading and stocking of freight is nonstop, with no extra time to clean up after other employees."
good,great place to grow in as far as people skills and communication. Teaces u growth and responsibility
good,"Normally my manager and I would go in the back of the store and assemble anything the store offered. We assembled grills, picnic tables, lawn mowers, tables, chairs, etc. When we would arrive we had a list of items to be assembled and a due date. We would then figure out which items had due dates that were coming up then we would execute them in order. When we were ahead of scheduele we would assemble things till we got off work. If there was nothing left in the bay we would go on the sales floor and help sell merchandise or we would assemble floor models. I've learned a lot about assembling a variety of different things which helped me when I bought my own things or when someone needed help assembling something of their own. I've learned how to time manage and get things done on my own. My customer service and sale skills have increased also. My management was great. I was close with my first line leader and my department manager was very relaxed about my Army reserve scheduele and would work around that for me. The hardest part of my job was the manual labor for hours at a time. Lifting heavy boxes of grills gets tiring after a while. The most enjoyable part of my job was how relax and on my own it was. I always got the job done and everyone was happy."
good,"Not too bad,but little dissapointed."
good,The most enjoyable part of the day would be watching the customers leave happy and satisfied
good,"Helped customers with getting supplies"
good,"Working with cash, setting up register, closing registers, scheduling lunches for all my cashiers. Helping customers firs before going to any of the management. I learned how to schedule lunches and still have enough coverage on registers for speedy checkouts for customers. Management was a ok team,"
good,"A lot of standing around, im a person who likes to move and work! but you are pretty much required to stay by the doors unless your needed! PAYS GREAT!"
good,good place to work the fellow coworkers are great and ive learned new equipment and safety procedures working here
good,I worked with a third party vendor to organize flowers in the display tables at Lowes
good,"The usual day starts off by me coming in, and greeting a few co-workers. Next I got clock-in and report to the back of receiving which is my department. The 2 other receiving employees and I engage in conversation then I begin with my work list. The hardest part about the job is not getting any help due to the fact I'll be the only person in my department at the time. Most of the supervisors are helpful except for the higher ups they are lazy and don't like to help. The best part of the day is when I come in and about hour before I leave when I associate with others"
good,Its a great place to work. Its a fun environment to be around. The managers are great to be around.
good,"-Clock in, greet customers and employees at a professional manner. Maintaining store quality by offering customer service, working as a team, and keeping the store organized and tidy."
good,I could be in many places at one time. I could be at customer service counter returns lumber front end and garden center. I liked being there. I was a able to do many tasks at one time. We were busy and I liked that a lot.
good,"Good place to work"
good,i love working here at lowes the only problem is. is that i have to change my availibility due to childcare changes
good,I like my job. There is great management and a good chance to move up. The days are easy and go by fast but I feel like I need more of  challenge. The only thing that gets hard on the day is not finding a answer for the customer faster then they needed it.
good,"The work was easy, Picked up valuable skills that can be applied to any warehouse setting. The company was a little bit too micromanaged for my taste and has unrealistic goal and false promises on moving up."
good,"On a typical day I would work at the customer service desk and help customers with transactions, returns, and answer general questions. I learned how to be productive with large amounts of work, and to be punctual. I enjoyed my coworkers and gained many friendships. The hardest part about my job was handling difficult customers however I learned very quickly that a smile goes a long way. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help and be surrounded by all type of people."
good,Really great management where I was.  You get one weekend off per month along with one Sunday guranteed.  And you can also request other weekends off but has to be ok'd by management.  They really like to keep the store straight and fully stocked.  Have to work early and late any day of the week which varies week to week.  Good company.  You have to love it to want a career there but if you get into upper management you won't have the nights and weekends.  Not a bad career for someone without a college degree and if you like home improvement and helping others this could be great for you.
good,"Typical day is fairly repetitive, management is pretty good, co-workers were great, advancement within company wasn't the greatest."
good,help people till the end of the day some of my co workers were a little too childish
good,"Great place to work if you are looking for a opportunity to advance withing a company structure, but working in the retail environments has it side effects."
good,Pulling delivery orders.
good,It is a good place to work
good,"I know some people will just think I'm complaining but this job is horrible, easy, but horrible. The pay was minimum wage, which seemed outrageous when I learned that for all the heavy lifting and cleaning and customer service we do we are payed less then a starting Cashier."
good,It is a nice place to work. Management is very competent. Staff is very loving and professional.
good,"I started at Lowe's as waterer, I was seasonal. I liked the job, my manager, everything was cool. Then I transferred over to delivery, I loved it, being on the road, but my manager was lazy, and would fight with me and my partner if we ran into any difficulties, rather than coach us through them. You are expected to know everything the first day. Training is scarce and laughable. They don't seem to care if you know what you're doing, but if you're a warm body. And if you don't know something, and you make a mistake, they yell at you rather than train you. They pretty much throw you to the wolves. I've seen alot of hard working people and good people getting frustrated and quitting, or getting fired because they refuse to train properly, and the expectations are way too high. I was one of those people. I started as a driver helper in delivery, and then all the sudden, I was the load puller, then, I had to set up recieving for freight, the responsibilities piled on. The final straw was when my boss was dangling a delivery driver position in my face, knew I had a child on the way, and they hired some full time driver off the street, with the same qualifications but no experience like I had, and I had to train him. They will mess with your head. And they don't like confrontation. Another example. I had printed my schedule the beginning of the week, worked Monday, had two days off only to come to work and find out I had been taken off the schedule without notice because the store needed to cut hours. I guess I should be fair, they did give me notice...on my WORK email...Only accessible"
good,"Typical day at work included, working with customers on plumbing needs. I also designed bathroom cabinetry and kitchen/bathroom sinks. My co-workers were VERY helpful, especially when I first started. The hardest part of the job, was being short handed at times and trying to handle 3-4 customers at once. But, overall my customers were awesome and I looked forward to work everyday."
good,"My experience with Lowe's offered the opportunity for me to work both in the distribution division and also in the retail stores. A typical day as a load planner included an environment of independence. It was my responsibility to ensure each tractor trailer (or ""van"") we scheduled to load for outbound delivery was correctly managed to ensure optimum weight requirements, the most efficient order of stops, and to design the most efficient route from the driver. The logistics to accomplish the end goal of product arriving to each store on time, in good condition, and being cost effective with delivery were daily goals. It also was enjoyable to analyze commercial carrier performance as I was the one to hire trucking companies to take routes. I had to choose a carrier who performed well. Management was supportive and the path to advancement was clear when I joined the team in 1994. Lowe's was poised to expand nationally, with the stock splitting several times in the 1990s, the times were good. The hardest decision I had to make was resigning from that position to assist my family after my father suddenly died. The retail stores also presented opportunity for advancement. The bad side was pay was comparable to a typical retail store position, the hours generally not great, and the competition to advance created the unfortunate political landscape most hate. After comparing the two sides of working for Lowe's, my personal preference is to work in the distribution division. However, in the stores, I had the unique experience to understand how the product arrived from distribution and"
good,wrok with dlients all day
good,cashier basic hardware items and make the customer at home. Fun work enviroment with motivation to keep working hard.
good,Wide range of pay scale for for employees doing the same job. Benefits are so-so. 401K is better than most places. Each store is managed differently. Really enjoyed working with some really nice people though. Time to seek better opportunities. The sky is the limit!
good,"Pay is above min wage. Hours are long, but gives extra day(s) off rather then 9-5 5 day week. Job involves heavy lifting, long time on feet. Not for a lazy person."
good,Management will work around your schedule and will help find the best position for you where you can be most productive and enjoy.
good,I enjoyed working by myself and learning about the different departments. I applied to other jobs in the store but moving to a different position is difficult.
good,They are good company to work for pay is great and the coworkers are great. You learn about different trades and grow as a person. You can move up in the company too
good,Had a great experience there working on people home and getting the satisfaction of helping a person with their homes was a great experience and good Holidays
good,It was faced paced and alot of customer service. Which was a major importance in that job. When not at register you still had to speak to customers that you pass. I like that because that is the focus everywhere or should be.
good,productive and fast paced work place. the management team was great and worked around any time i needed off for appointments. all of my coworkers were east to work with and great to be around.
good,"Lowes is a great company to work for, the associates at my store are like a family. We all support one another and work great together. I have been in my position for 6 months and the learning has not stopped, things are constantly changing for the better."
good,"Pay is alright, all stores seem to be understaffed and busy, so be prepared to be all over the place and working multiple departments. Employees are really friendly and if you ask for help, they'll definitely help if they have the time."
good,"Typical work day as an unloaded was fair started by getting a trunk unloaded of the products, sorting product by departments and stock said product into the departments assigned"
good,"I liked working here for almost a year as a front end cashier, but I have to say that I also worked in the lumber dept as a cashier sales associate and the garden area it was fun. But too many hours"
good,"Worked there for 2 years and the biggest complaint that I have is that the management, at least at my store, was infuriating. Things like I'd see schedule conflicts with my availability, breaks are something that can be taken away depending on the competency of schedule composition for that day, managers taking credit for the work of the people beneath them, phones/walky-talkies being completely unusable (and nobody doing anything to fix that despite being notified multiple times), and general difficulty trying to communicate with my direct superviser (I wound up having to leave hand-written letters in his office taped to the computer monitor just to be sure I know he would be notified of nigh anything since emailing him wasn't good enough)"
good,Lowes within the 8 years I have been there has been fun. I have had problems with management which caused me to transfer. But I love the people that work there and they help make the day go by fast
good,Worked hard worked witb different department heads to acquire goals did inventory customer service operated machinery ordered magazines signs did resets and invemtory counts
good,I had initially started this job working in the outside garden area but was moved to cashier after someone quit. So I stayed there and got good hours with a nice and friendly management team. Of course there's things like horrible customers but that's to be expected working in a place like Lowes. I would like to note I was a seasonal employee so I didn't receive any benefits but I do hear that they are good if you do get hired as a permanent staff member.
good,"It was a good place to work at, the benefits, and the hours are fixed. The down falls pertain to individuals and now lowes as a company. I hope people keep their integrity, respect, and professionalism."
good,I loved working at lowes.  but when the hrs werre cut I needednto find a new job   I cant live on 20 hrs a week.  I liked working in diffent areas.  I want to train in other areas
good,Lowe’s can increase there profits by weeding through the effective loses and dedicate their strengths where it’s needed instead of masking the problem
good,The staffing is very kind. You don't get trained in your department though and that gets frustrating when you don't know answers to questions. Customers can be disagreeable.
good,Store manager was awesome and gave us freedom to help customers and make our department better.  Wasn't a big fan of different rules passed down from corporate that didn't have anything to do with us.
good,"I did enjoy working for Lowe's Home Improvement in Shallotte, NC."
good,"Great Work Place! work life balance great benefits- nice people to work for. great management team. Developing skills are great as well, development is key"
good,"Not bad most times.   "
good,Lowes is a good place to work with the right people however upper management is sometimes hard to work with. Theres not much room for advancement unless you have open availability
good,"- I learned a lot about customer service"
good,I liked working here and when it came up for me to get on full time they gave to position to someone who was not seasonal.  So I was laid off.  I knew more and was in my mind a better employee then he was.
good,"It was a fast pace job, very fun job. Once you got the hang of it , it was quite easy. The job had amazing hours. Management took care of there employees."
good,"Lowes offer's fair pay and an inclusive work culture. The hours were pretty flexible and accommodating towards my school schedule. However, hours scheduled per week were inconsistent for part-timers, which made it difficult to make plans with my money ( one week I would work 30 hours and the next 10)"
good,At this job I met a lot of positive people and learn a lot about team work. The energy around people I work with was great. We always finish our job on time.
good,"The money is good for a retail job. There's no advancement opportunities. They say they would rather hire from within the store but rarely does. Management isn't great. Doesn't listen to your needs. Mainly concerned with hitting sales numbers. Benefits are decent not great. Overall it's a retail atmosphere of course, but the company really needs to work on who they hire for ""HR and managers""."
good,I don’t know what you want to do but it was just not really a bad day to go pick it out but I’m going home now I’ll let her go pick it out I don’t will you get what I need it
good,"Typical work day at Lowes. Customer service, Stocking, Down Stocking, pricing. Not a bad job for a starter job as you must take a Seasonal position..."
good,fast pace work environment good management friendly coworkers  hard to meet the time scheduled sometimes with customers stopping you for answers i enjoy talking with the coworker on break
good,"Good workplace with friendly work people very good company that helps there employers. They take real good care of there employees, also they are very easy as a work environment."
good,Working at Lowe's you are always busy and never just standing around doing nothing which makes the time go by fast. Management is always very helpful.
good,"My time at Lowes I felt as though i was very well trained, taken care for and appreciated for the work I did. While being trained it was concise and they kept up with adding new skills as well as offering forklift certification."
good,Ever since they fired 80% of the management staff it all went downhill.  The expectation that Lowe's can do more with less is not is the best interest of the customers not to mention the strain it puts on its sales staff.
good,Excellent place to work for! Strong job security and a good work flow throughout the day. I learned a lot regarding tools and home maintenance. Strongly recommend applying here.
good,"Can sometime be stressful and some easy paced, good management mostly they have large turn around each year,which is kinda hard, great benefit, mostly a good place to work. I love helping customers so they care about customer service as there top priority"
good,"Performance reviews are key to offering helpful feedback to a manager or employee. But not knowing what to say or write can make the process downright painful, especially on a deadline. "
good,"Good co-works that made it a fun place to work. Manual labor that keeps you in shape and helps you stay fit. no downside to the job but being outside in the heat,"
good,it helped me a lot as far as gaining skills in the work force and it also gave me stability as far as holding down a job and working long hours and I am a hardworking employee.
good,"A typical day at work includes answering the phone to schedule incoming freight, making sure the trucks get unloaded in the order they checked in with me.  Helping associates by answering questions about procedures or helping them find specific merchandise for the customers.  The culture in receiving is a fast paced, multi tasking to get the work done.  There is a challenge in multi tasking, but it is sometimes hard to due with the amount of challenges at one time.  The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I help many people find answers and solutions to help them accomplish what they need to do for the customer and the company."
good,"Friendly and passionate managers, great benefits, healthy flexibility, safe and well organized work environment, conveniently placed in the community. Reccomend it!"
good,"Enjoy working with customers helping them love where they live. A typical day at work is answering phones & assisting customers with questions regarding any and all issues. Also calls from stores to get their system updates and figure out what program needed to run through their system to get equipment running smoothly. "
good,"i love the emviroment, and the people i worked with. the only issue that i have faced was were the location that i have worked the management were terrible. we were always understaffed, unfair hours, and favorism was thrown all around."
good,"Es un buen ambiente de trabajo,  solo que un poco de dificultades por ser una empresa nueva en culiacan."
good,"They don't mind if you're a little late, they have a wonderful clock-in system that always makes sure your hours are correct, and wonderful management."
good,When I first started Wal-mart it was the first time I ever work at a grocery store. I worked in frozen and daily department. I stocked the shelfts and help the customers fine what they need when they couldn't fine it. I also help the over grocery departments unload trucks that came in. I got alone fine with my co-works didn't get alone with my department manger she was every hateful all the time.
good,Being a cashier and asking the customers how their day was and start a conversation make them feel comfortable. I learned that when people have a bad day and take it out on you to remain calm and never argue back. I loved my staff and my managers they are great at what they do and always positive energy. Never hard because i love a challenge. Seeing a customer ;eave the store happy and coming back the next day.
good,I truly loved working for Lowe's. To move up with the company was difficult I found it to be. The hardest part was learning a certain area of the business if you never worked in that area before. My most enjoyable was making sure every customer I came into to contact with was happy and that they were going to come back and do more business with us.
good,I really enjoyed working for lowe's. I quit lowe's because I would have weekends off to spend time with my boys. I'm thankful that  the managers for being understanding about my situation
good,My team was the best team of it's district. We were nominated and won the best customer service for our franchise. I've learn so much from this company.
good,I have just as a person realized it is time to move on. I need to find myself a career and I do not feel like that is with Lowe's anymore.
good,- a typical day working at Lowes was challenging but in a good way. I have now learnt to overcome the challenges and goals that I face
good,It's a job. Not the worst but not the greatest. I was only hired as seasonal but got asked to stay as peak. Co workers are all friendly. Communication could be better though.
good,"Centered around exceptional customer service, lowes is a great company that seeks talent from within. Great advancements in customer service associations"
good,"I loved working here with the people I worked with, I just hated how standards were not really a priority in everything. I wanted balance and consistency but there was not much of that in day to day working."
good,"Worked from home for 2 hours a day otherwise I was on the road surveying Home Depots, Wal-Marts and other stores that were in competition with us. Had shops and project which were time sensitive. Responsible for relaying any new promotions within are competitors."
good,Only hard part is getting up for the job which starts at 4:00 AM.
good,"A typical day at work would be being at the customer service desk, register, or on the floor helping customers find what they are looking for. I get along with my co-workers and my manager. Me and my manager laugh together all the time. I like working at Lowe's because there are really some great people that works through those doors."
good,Assist customers & manage associates. Fast pace environment
good,"Was a great place to work! Good environment, the pay was good and the mangers were awesome!"
good,I would go in everyday review sales from the previous day and on a weekly part of my job i would look over reports from the previous week and compare sales from the weeks before
good,i loved working in outside lawn and garden and working around people. i loved my co-workers
good,A job not a Career ive learned to never stop improving thats the moto which is why im seeking a career not just a JOB.
good,I love working at lowes don't mind going the extra mile to meet customers needs and expectations.
good,great employees very active place. meeting new people everyday.
good,"Good for college students. Pays well, great management, and flexible with scheduling."
good,"I had a really hard time being an outsider chosen for such a leadership role. It was a challenge learning the systems including the cash register, the in's & out's of Genesis, customer service, & getting the cashiers & my other coworkers to respect me. I'm very hands on, but learning everything went so fast. If I did something wrong, my direct manager at the time was very hard on me. He wasn't very reasonable & the only time he had for you was to verbally warn you or write you up. Lowe's was great to me as a whole & I loved the company, but being a Head Cashier is very stressful! But it has it's good days, too; like most jobs & companies."
good,"Escalation Manager,"
good,Great Company to work for and I would go back anytime. It was a great company that really cares about their employees
good,"I was a cashier at Lowe's.  This meant working with customers, organizing merchandise, and working with money. The job was dependable, but wasn't what I was interested in."
good,"When I come in to work, I go onto a register and start ringing the customers items up. I Love the people i work with everyone is very helpful. The best part of my ob is having the customers leave the store with a smile on their face."
good,Managers at the store that I worked at were ok it was just the store manager showed a lot of favoritism.
good,It was a good job. Plenty of room for promotion and if you work hard you can easily progress through the system. Hours are the greatest but it is a decent job if you can get a good manager. 
good,"Complete store safety review (DSR), focus list throughout the day. product investigations and research."
good,I made great money at Lowe's. I made a lot of great friendships there. Didnt like the hours I worked too much
good,"i worked for two years as a plant vendor in the garden center. the job was quite relaxed and not difficult at all; i was told to do things, completed the task, and moved on to other tasks. sometimes there was nothing to do so work could get slow. my vendor manager was horrible; showed no sense of respect for any of her employees. the other lowes employees constantly stood around daily so most of the work was put on the vendors' shoulders. other than poor management and organization, the work was overall satisfactory."
good,Younger management is the downfall of this company to be more profitable and growth for the future. Inexperience to make tough decisions and the service level overall is down and needs more open minded individuals at the decision making positions.
good,"-typical work day: routing delivery trucks, and taking care of customers orders, making sure deliveries arrive on time, solving customers issue and concerns, maintaining commercial trucks maintenance, keeping up with DOT laws, keeping the communication between the customers, drivers, and sales associates, etc"
good,I used to work at Lowes for 3 years. The only reason I left was because they never advanced me. I was part time the full 3 years. But Lowes is a good place to work and very easy to get attached to your co workers. I have nothing bad to say about it but the exceptions of lack of promotion opportunities.
good,not much to say about them really really not too much to say about this employer. Been with them for 3 years .
good,"Pay is very competitive, although work conditions can be very strenuous. Overall not a bad company to work for."
good,great job. good benefits good hours good pay. nice place to work for
good,Went from night sticker to managing in less than a year. Would recommend employment. Management structure is excellent and very compery wages . Would recommend application.
good,Lowes is an okay place to work. No one says good job or anything. There is so many people that are favorited over others. I was never appreciated while working there.
good,"As a past Assembler(position terminated)/ cashier, I can say it was a good experience especially the strong work ethic and customer service. The main thing was job security. I would’ve appreciated a 2 week notice to find another job but the compensation was greatly appreciated. Management was alright. Environment was good."
good,I really loved it and it was a nice learning experience. I just wish I was mature enough to care about my job and appreciate what I had. The management was great and they have lots of great opportunities for you to move up. They have constant events going on and they do blood drives.
good,Great pay but lack of great management. Lowes is a great place to work depending on your upper management team. Just like any other business when there is a lack or management there is a lack of organization.
good,I had wonderful customers that made my job enjoyable.  Being able to help people was a great experience.  I wish I was given more hours and was able to stay in one department.
good,"When you work here it is a great place to work at Lowe’s, when I first started here all of the employees welcomed me with opening arms and was so nice and made me feel like I was meant to be there and that was the best thing!"
good,It was a great company overall. Some things Lowe’s needs to work on. Management was over worked and stressed out all the time. Co workers would help only if it met there time.
good,"Working here is very difficult when the store is so understaffed. Stress is a common feeling you will experience while on the clock, but I do like the people I work with a lot"
good,"Started off as an awesome place to work .Over time the job became just that, a job. Like most companies lowe's is very competitive with a huge turn around. You have to be a people person and willing to sell your soul a little. there were many times i took a bullet for the company.Unfortunately in the end the kill shot came from friendly fire."
good,"i learn to be in this job u gotta be ready to work and on your a game so that u want get behind, the hardest part of the job is probably getting the hang \of the forklift, the most enjoyable part of this job s that when u get paid lol and that your work is done for today"
good,Working with the general public and with such amazing and outgoing people made this job worth it. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers with any difficulties they had
good,"Best part of my job was helping customers, I learned so much working here. Management was really good to their employees and the workplace environment was good."
good,unless you play their politics you don't have a chance to move around to other places on the floor or advancement for that matter.  Went seasonal after working as a cashier for a year and after the seasonal stint was over they were going to put me back as a cashier--told them that I wouldn't last 6 months so opted to be laid off with the rest of the seasonal people--don't have a problem with a job where I can move around but standing in one spot isn't good for my back.
good,"Routine was mostly the same on a day to day basis. The management was very nice and helpful, as well as coworkers. They paid well for the work that you did."
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers love where they live. Helping them fulfill their project needs. I learned that customers are only satisfied if you help them get what they need in the best timely manner. Management tries their best to help the customers get what they came for without any issues. Everyone in the workplace, no matter the race, we all help each other to get the job done. Hardest part is trying to satisfy a customer who wants more of a discount than their already getting. We can't push the limit too far for them. We kindly apologize and say we can't do much here in this situation. The best part of the job is seeing smiling faces on customers that walk in and are ready to start their shopping for the projects they are working on. Me being a cashier, they are happy to see me because I am friendly and I am interested in their projects because I tell them to take pictures and bring it in to show me what they have accomplished. I make the customers eager to always come back to Lowe's for their shopping needs."
good,"Lowe's is a fast paced demanding job. I recommend that you be in good health, don't mind lifting 50 lbs or more. It is a physical job. Cashier included if lifting heavy bags or other products. It is a rewarding place to work if you enjoy people. Customer service is a must! Lowe's is a great place to get started in a customer service environment.."
good,"Pay is good. Insurance premiums are fair for the market. The store hours can get old after a while. I would recommend this job for those with minimum work history,"
good,"Load and Unload trailers."
good,"Fairly easy going from day to day"
good,Good company to work for. Benefit wise. Meet a lot of interesting people. Get to transfer to other lowes if you ever need to relocate to another state.
good,this is just your local hardware store. i learned the differences between perinals and annuals. Worked in the floral department. and assembled  wheel barrels.
good,"Loved this job , hated to leave it . Enjoyed going everyday , the people were awesome . Loved the challenge everyday. Management would always work with u and listened to anything u have to say."
good,"was very busy and was always something to do plus the pay was great, easy to move to other departments to learn more skills/advancements also appreciation of hard work"
good,"No hay mucho para contar, me agradan las flores y mas interactuar con el público."
good,"Working part time - if you are scheduled for 5 1/2 hours - 1/2 hr unpaid lunch break, scheduled for 5 hrs - 15 minute paid break."
good,I like the work place the employee were great. But I felt like I was worth more then just a cashier. I also wanted a full time position with better benefits.
good,"The work.I liked seeing pets that came in the store  with their owners and  I liked working with my co-workers. The most hardest part of my job is that I was too slow at working in what I was doing. I learned a great deal at what I was doing when I worked at other departments. What I disliked about one of my job was watering the plants. It was discouraging,"
good,I get to work and make sure everything is down-stocked. I help customers out. Talk to costumers about the item they are looking at. Help other co-workers if there area is busy.
good,company has many opportunities. There are over 15 depts. and many positions .The hours are long but the staff are ususally good.
good,Fun place to work with supportive management. I enjoyed working for this company because the other employees made me feel welcomed.
good,I worked for the distribution center and somedays you would work 14 to 16 hours. It would be great if i had a family to support.
good,I Learned How To Teach other Worker How To work as A Team Working with this company was a good experience to me we worked with customers a lot I have learned how to do returns  and exchanging
good,I was about 145 pounds and I was a loader. My back became very hunched when I worked there. It became so much of an issue that I could not look up properly.
good,"Dusty and dry environment however very fun people to work with, almost enthusiastic i came to work with a smile very frequently"
good,"This is a good company to work for. Lots of room for advancement and very quickly, if you show them you can handle it and know what you're doing."
good,Working at Lowe's has been a great experience for me. There is a wide variety of job opportunities and there is room for job advancement. My managers have been very understanding with my availability in transition periods in my life. I have obtained a large amount of experience in customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to constantly multi-task. The most difficult part of my job is communication due to the large amount of employees.
good,awesome very challenging would love to work here again. only in another position or job description.
good,"Customer service repeat customers and new very rewarding. Product knowledge, home improvement. Managers are well liked. Nothing is hard as long as you are able to multitask. Learning how solve problems for customers."
good,Could have been better if given the opportunity. I was given total autonomy and freedom to complete my task at work. Plus the salary/benefits package were a plus. Would have enjoyed working that into a career.
good,"Easy job, Come in on time,Do what they ask of you. Great for retired people that just want to stay busy"
good,I love working at Lowe's but am not presented with any opportunities to advance in mine or any other department. It seems as if only the male workers are advancing at this time and I'm beginning to become fed up!
good,Helping customers with thier equipment questions and issues. Great overall atmosphere and pleasent enviroment
good,"I enjoyed working here, but very little overtime was authorized. At times, it was hard to even get a full 40 hours during the work week due to over staffing. The crew was friendly. The training program was very good and included a history lesson about the company that was interactive."
good,"I did so much enjoy this job. All the opportunities to learn so many ways to improve the home improvement shopping experience. I had the ability to do check out, returns stocking the shelves with the returns at the end of the day and was certified in ALL areas of machine operations."
good,I would recommend working for Lowes. The managers that I worked for were great in helping you out. I enjoyed my time there very much.
good,"I loved this job, but i had to take care of my family so I couldn't stay. I loves working with the different departments. I was always on my toes. I loved the fact they sent me for training to inspect installs."
good,A typical day at work would be me processing overseeing employees behind registers and customer service area. Co-workers are friendly and always willing to help. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people when in need.
good,"Working at Lowe's taught me how to work on different equipment and how to take criticism, i had some workers that were fun to work with and then some who wasn't so nice to work with, hardest part of the job is working 2different departments without notice the most fun i had at Lowe's is driving the stand up forklift"
good,"Good place, great hours, but they have low pay scales. Worked with great people at Lowe's, but living off of 8.44/hr is not enough to live on now days,"
good,I really enjoy my job there is room for advancement. They have a lot of modules in place to help you learn and advance.
good,over all good place to work experience. As an over high stocker first we unload the truck then we are put in to separate and we stock merchandise.departments
good,Always do what the ask me to do and always on time there's a few things I can quistion about Lowes but over all it's a good place to work. It's good for a beginner for heavy machinery and can learn alot about retail.
good,"Plenty to do, little down time. Can be stressful but there is plenty of support from management when asked"
good,Working at Lowe's was very enjoying had a great time working at  nice co workers we went out and ate often got along with co workers laugh joke often.
good,"Management needs much more training, Pay Rate is fair for our market, Friendly Working Envirorment. Company was very nice to me when I had to take a leave of absense to care for my Mother, they also paid 1/2 of the Funeral Cost when my Mother passed."
good,9 years and I learned a lot.  Especially lumber and contractor building. Prices changes and audits. Met lots of great people  along the way. And learned about loss prevention and how that effects the bottom line
good,"Working at Lowes very steamless experience and learning workplace providing full support, quality training and competitive compensation.   The entrepreneur share tips for organizing, celebrates arrival of hangers and steamers at stores across the U.S. great work for the community giveback."
good,"The customer bring life too the store, you have some nice and some mean but I knew how to handle everything I keep my cool. I always did my job no matter what , I work untill it time for me to clock out."
good,"It was a good place to work at. It was both fast paced and slow, depends on the day and time. I learned quite a bit from working there. I knew almost nothing before working there and I feel I know alot about the paint industry, products and what is best to use when and where. I have to say the job wasn't really hard. I didn't find that job to be really hard, just sometimes stressful. Being stressful such as, being called while busy with other customers. I enjoyed being there, I liked my fellow associates, I liked my job itself and everything."
good,i had a good time working for them my typical day at work was from 6 to 3 everyday i have learned to use a forklift and the management was ok the hardest part was not having anyone help me out when it got busey
good,"A normal day of work consists of unloading products from delivery trunk, so that by the end of the day we may stock them on display selves. Our deadlines were usually met."
good,"•	Accountable for safe, accurate and efficient unloading and dispersement of RDC freight"
good,was a good place to learn and improve on your people skills. the employees and management are good people and hard workers
good,Everyone was always super nice and friendly. I loved coming to work every day. All the managers were professional but also fun at the same time. The training was very long and most of it unecesary for my position. Hardest part of the job was rotating cash registers. It would happen up to 5 times a day sometimes. Doing that was confusing and frustrating. Easiest part of the job was re stocking pop machines. I love the company itself but the location of the store I worked in had extremely high crime so I decided to look for something safer.
good,its an ok job to work at especially if you're in school. manager isnt the best. everyone i work with is great though
good,the most enjoyable part of than I saw the customer statisfaction.THAT AWSOME Feeling
good,its nice to have4 days and work full time. lowes is flexible with schedules.  people there are always looking out for each other and everyone is willing  to help out.
good,"Sad to see the company shut down and move to Canada, i enjoyed my time there and was able to meet and bond with so many people i still talk to today. Hardest part of the job was working with human errors in our catalogs and explaining to customers what happened on our end."
good,A tropical day at Lowe's .We work hard to get the job done . I learn all my Department and part number. Measurement is there to help. We work hard to keep the work place clean. The hardest part of my job is to get the truck unloaded fast the most enjoyable part of the job is we work as a team.
good,"Fast pace company, always busy. Unload freight trucks and move product to the floor. Assist customers in sales in all departments."
good,I learned so much about rebuilding homes and managing a strong team.
good,"I did enjoy this job except it was at a more slow place - we would have a lot of down time and couldn't really clean for our downtime. I enjoy more of fast pace, stressful environment it really gets me motivated and pushes me to be the best I can be in any position."
good,its a good job its a job thats good for someone whoes in school and looking for good pay as a college student.
good,mostly a starter job in retail for those looking for their first job.
good,Working at Lowe’s was a great experience for me skill wise & opportunity wise as far as The people you meet there. Also gives great chances to learn more bout home improvement
good,The workplace culture was good the service was great the customers were good certain times problems with the service and the prices of the items or clearance items returns exchanges
good,worked there for 2 months. was hired on for seasonal and they kept hiring and hiring and hiring and then they laid me off because they hired too many people for the season. :( wanted to work there longer. great place to meet all kinds of people.
good,"Great managers there,departments just very unorganized! Employee are always helping one another. Only bad thing is customers had to wait for loaders and cashier backup. Other than these small things,great company and store to work for!"
good,great place to work the people was great and the customers were great. i lo ved my job and helping people. i enjoyed working with the public and helping with home purches.
good,"excellent workmate. much security for the employee and a good salary payment "
good,"Nice place to work with good management and great co-workers. Typical day included receiving store stock, and shipping back any returned merchandise."
good,When I worked there management pulled me into the office and yelled at me when I did something wrong instead of talking to me. Better for temp job....
good,"I can  not say ,I don't judge  places,the people where nice  and very busy  places to work for .I consider this place not  for everyone. Can be stressful and I have  seen large numbers of people leaving."
good,Very fast paced environment. Management only watch out for themselves. They don't try to work with anyones schedules. They overwork certain employees.
good,Loved the company hated the store. Lowes was a great place to work. My store (1979) was just very poorly managed. After corporate reconstructed the management roles it became impossible to manage stores properly.
good,"Certain days are slower than others, however Lowes is a place for retired people to work. IT's only part time and it's very slow. I'm in customer service and it gets very boring just standing around waiting for customers."
good,Walk the store of which you intend to apply to. To get the feel of the people you will be working with. Pretend to be a customer for a day and observe others.
good,"It was always like my second family when it came to my co workers. Management, well i wish i could say the same, A bunch of know it all, very sarcastic. I worked for the lumber department in Staten Island, it felt like we were working for a car dealership, everything had to be blue lined, front faced. Work consists of down stocking, loading off loading, and assisting customers. Sometime the store might be a little short staffed so you will find yourself overwhelmed at times. Other then that i really can't complain because the pay is not to bad."
good,Lowes does not cater to older people. If you want to advanvce and are young great company. Lowes likes young people so they can mold them into the Lowes way of thinking.
good,"Department managers were great, but there is a lot of turmoil at Lowe's. The assistant managers do not care about employees or there health. Hardest part is the managers and getting them to work with you. The most enjoyable part were the other employees."
good,Another job to help me pay for college. This was the one that I would keep if I didn't move on. This is a very good place to work and the people are even greater. 
good,"Open availability required, little chance for advancement and retirement plan good but other benefits not so good. Plan to work all holidays."
good,I liked the job but the customers was rude nasty and racist. I went to a customers house they saw that we were black and lied about damage to their wood floor in the kitchen i was asked and said it was no damage done to the floor. lowes replaced a 5000.00 dollar floor for nothing i was hurt about it. but what can you do about it. Delivering for customers please take pictures cover your but at all times and you be fine.
good,The hours were ridiculous at times but that's the way it is with retail jobs. Not a bad place to work for if you don't have kids. If you have kids it makes it hard to see them at times. You are either working evening or until closing so they are in bed when you get home and and at school during the day. Makes for some missed family time.
good,Lowe's hired me as a CSR but as a seasonal employee they placed me as a cashier and I had zero experience as a cashier.  I was so good at my job that I won Cashier of the month!
good,"A lot of favoritism from managers, a lot of rumors, a lot of disrespect from managers and other associates. It can be fun if you can make friends, but there's so much ""he said she said' drama that goes on. If you're wanting to work at Lowe's, i recommend sticking to yourself, don't bring your personal like to work, take care of your customers, and do your job. Go to work, not to gossip!"
good,"I was let go from my job without any notice after an email was sent out that seasonal associates would be given a 2 weeks notice. Our store manager decided to go on vacation during this time,"
good,"The management is miserable, everyone is replaceable, not many opportunities to advance. I miss the way Lowe’s used to work. It’s no longer a fun environment"
good,it was a half way descent place to work at. A lot of the other employs where good to work with.  But a lot of them could of been spoken to. Overall if I wanted to go back or was asked to go back I would.
good,Night shift that accommodated my family when I needed to work nights so my wife could work days and we were not out childcare. It was a small crew and the work was quick paced in the start of shift but slowed towards the end as long as you knew your department and could stock properly.
good,Store don't have qualified employees making the ones that do know a lot helping in all areas. Plus the store don't hire people making the ones that are working spend long days
good,"It depends who is the store manager, I had a great manager that was really good to the associates, But when you have a bad store manager its the worst place to work for because they always support the store manager and don't believe what the associates are saying"
good,I really enjoyed working for the company. I didn't like the hours with it being graveyard shift. I'm more of a day time person than I am a nighttime person.
good,I liked working there i was a okay job but they wouldn't give me any hours.
good,Learned alot when working there. I really enjoyed my co-workers. I liked working in lawn and garden.
good,"I really like helping people solve problems so I like this job. Unfortunately if you don't start working here in highschool, advancement is slow and the pay isn't much. For a kid straight out of school or working while in college this is a great place to work. Their health and dental benefits are average and with the amount of learning you have at your finger tips, a great first or second place to work."
good,"Lowe's is a decent company to work for, I just couldn't make it a career. However, I think they can do better with pay for some jobs. Upper level position should have more respect for the lower positions."
good,You must be flexible with your schedule. Always on time. Must be a team player. Can do heavy lifting. Must be able to multi task. Must be a people person. Have computer skills is a must!
good,To much micro managing.  Need to have more life work balance.  Pay needs to be more what the market is.  Work on advancing in market instead of going out of the company.
good,"its a fast paced environment with a lot of demanding customers wanting specific things, so knowing customer service and knowing how to deal with these type of people is a big must. It has its ups and downs like any job would, but overall is a great job to have if you want to work in the customer service field and/or the retail field."
good,There is no communication throughout managers and I never see my actual manager unless they’re coming to me to tell me something negative that isn’t true that they have heard through other associates who don’t even work the same hours as me.
good,"Management not adequate when employees being harassed for physical disabilities. If you are in the ""click,"" you can do no wrong. Not satisfied with disciplinary procedures when rules are violated."
good,If lowes has a completely reliable management team then it would run even smoother. Some associates really don’t do a whole lot and I’m the flooring department there are a lot of problems with the Specialist part not doing their job all the way through
good,"Fairly good working conditions, reasonable pay. They need to care more about the employees as far as being able to have a life outside of work."
good,"its a good temporary job, not something to do for years due to managers attitude. I wouldn't go back if they paid me $30 ahour. horrible communication skills."
good,"When i started working at the lowes in catskill NY it was great people, great store manager.Now all the good people were forced out and nobody wants to work. Dont know why they forced all the great workers out."
good,"Great place to work but being part time. Hours are awful. Great job if you are retired, as I am. The management has a lot to be desired. would continue working, but all the strange hours are killing me."
good,My employment at Lowes was temporary while I was attending school.  So I only worked part time and for 6 months.  I worked evenings as a stocker which was not stressful and atmosphere was relaxed.
good,Lowes was not very forthcoming.  They hired me on at part time and  worked me like full time with overtime for 14 years and never gave me any benefits.  They treated me unfairly.  I stayed because I had no where else to go and a lot of bills.
good,"was a great job but no concideration for employees family life,just get job done attitude work schedule was ignored daily and changed lots and lots of overtime"
good,"Its a great job for high-school or college students to make extra cash. Just understand that if you apply for the cashier position, you will work outside regardless of how hot or cold it may be."
good,First it was a great job. Over time something changed and I was targeted. My schedule changed to all closings.  If you aren’t in with the manager then your an outsider.
good,"If you are interested in learning what it takes to build, maintain, upgrade and augment any homestead or business then Lowe's is the place for you. "
good,"Good company whose local store poorly represented the corporation in terms of providing responsible/consistent customer service and demonstrating integrity to the staff."
good,"Fast paced environment that keeps you always on your toes, so you will never be bored. advancement comes down to your qualifications. HR does their best to boost morale and help make it a fun, friendly and clean environment. Great people to work with."
good,"Difficult time getting along"
good,"Soon as you clock in you get you box of money, we count every bill and coin. We needed to make sure the amount given to us was correct before heading to our assign register. Some day would be fast pace other really slow."
good,"Being a loader at lowe's means you get carts, lift heavy stuff, get stuff from the back of the store and then do other peoples jobs when they are being slow. Its decent pay for when its a slow day but it becomes less worth it when the store gets influxes of customers. if you want money and a decent work out its good for a first job."
good,"Enjoyed working from home, the metrics they set, initially,seemed intimidating but after a few weeks things came more easily attainable, .I enjoyed talking to the customers and their various needs. The satisfaction I got fro helping them and hearing them go away happy was a good feeling also. The hardest part of the job was when there was a language barrier. There were monthly meetings, which were informative, that kept us up on what was coming as far as promotions and such,"
good,Always able to learn something new and become more product aware. Giving the change to build customer personal relation and focus on what the desires of the customers wants and needs are.
good,"Cashier for almost 5 years, hard to advance off the front end, you are not appreciated. Applied 5 times for open positions, I did not get an interview."
good,very small cramp room to work from. no windows. team was great. management really under appreciate the work and value of the team members. not much room too grow.
good,"I was with Lowe's for almost 10 years.  The biggest thing that I learned while with them was that it really depends on your store manager to dictate your experience.  I worked for several different managers in my time with Lowe's.  Most were open and willing to help, even the district managers were usually willing to help.  Unfortunately the last store manager  that I worked for was more interested in playing favorites and unwilling to help people on the floor that were asking for it."
good,"Lowes is a great company to work for, with great benefits!"
good,I enjoyed my time there with the fellow co-workers and wonderful shoppers i got to meet. I had issues in the end while trying to relocate to my new home and was unable to transfer to a new store.
good,working for this company was a great learning experience but i had to take off to go care for my child at the time being. working in the outside lawn and garden area you meet alot of new coustmers in that line of work. be prepared to get dirty and to lift heavy things outside for coustmers
good,"This company is a great place to start, but after being there for more than a few years you can tell it's not what it used to be. Every year there is more expected, and less incentive. When I first started there were sales incentives (commissioned sales), obviously a lot of the seasoned salesmen dropped out almost immediately, and it just been a domino effect from there. While the company had great intentions for advancement its only for individuals that want to move towards management, nothing of the others. You can't run a business with all chiefs and no indians."
good,"No review "
good,"This was a physically often exhausting job with varying management feedback. Some managers were very supportive and pitched in on occasion while others were often condescending and belittling of employees, which lowered employee morale and encouraged resentment towards certain managers and an uncaring attitude among many employees about their job and the company. Many employees therefore did the bare minimum in completing their duties."
good,"service the customers and handle day to day chores. In the process I learned money management and handling skills for safety, scheduling and anti theft devices and how to prevent this from occurring. most co workers of the same age group were on task and did day to day tasks. Some were lacking the guidance. Management did not always adhere to company policy when offering promotions. They chose whom they wanted and not always the best canididate for the job. The most enjoyable time of the day was interacting with the customers."
good,"After 2008 the company began to change.  Bonuses were cut out, Commissions were taken away.  Management stopped caring about the employees and began to be micro-managers."
good,The job is physically demanding. Management is most concerned with the corporate mandated charts and graphs regarding size of truck and times to unload. The most rewarding part of the job is the camaraderie with my coworkers.
good,"Its an okay job but work you hard at times, I just been there to long cut hours you have to be in good with management to move up in the company"
good,If you are a people person you will enjoy working for Lowes. Most days it was hard to find your co workers. It seemed like they would disappear for hours at a time.
good,"I like lowe's. Now , I have the experience  of most of the construction  products  and know  how  to do a lot of repair myself. I still  go to Lowe's for all my construction needs."
good,It’s an ok place to work but it has its issues. They tend to hire unreliable people which can be stressful for those who actually care and will often leave departments without coverage.
good,"My experience could of and should been better however do not work at West Philly. The management team is rude, the culture is horrible and the area is worst. Management doesn’t care how you are spoken to. There is corporate walks every week. The area and culture of this store is seriously unprofessional. The store manager is the coldest person ever. She will yell and embarrass you even in front your employees and the customers"
good,Great people and fun job but terribly under paid! Horrible schedule unless you're a specialist. Management was fantastic except for 1 Assistant Store manager. Super clean store and quite busy!
good,I worked for the grocery store named lowes There are two different lowes which are lowes home inporovement and the grocery store....Vey help full took time to help find what u were looking for and had things ready to go if u order on line
good,Better if you only stay temporarily. Good coworkers. Work is stressful and fast paced during the summer and slow during the winter. High responsibility for low pay.
good,report to work at 6am on light duty so i am at self check. dont feel like there is job security with all the changes. I learned I do like working with the public
good,I really enjoyed working here and found the work easy and customer service fun. the store also had really good management and it was easy to get along with fellow workers.
good,"Good benefits decent but not great pay. Don't keep up with cost of living increases. Management sucks. Few know how to communicate, with each other or employees."
good,Lowes is a great co. They have good benefits but you work all kinds of hours and almost every weekend. There expectations of what can be done in an 8 hour shift is unrealistic. Management has a lot to do with that. Managers do not help you at all they say they don't want to here excuses (busy with customers is not an excuse its a reason) Not all Lowes are that way. I would not deter anyone from working for Lowes but be ready to here no excuses.
good,"I work over nights so it's hard to find time for sleep work and family life. Over all not too hard of work, but can definitely be challenging for people with families and children."
good,Work/home life balance is non-existent for most positions including managers. The only jobs worth having are in Pro Services and the merchandising crew. Those jobs are Monday through Friday.
good,"When I was with the company there was an inverted pyramid in management, way to many managers to run the building.They did a management restructure and fixed it. They took care of the managers that were let go."
good,very clickish so had to get in good with the managers.  some people don’t do anything at all while the responsibility lies on a few good souls.  be expected to work many departments
good,"Managers aren’t always the best, and co workers are often not there to help. However i did enjoy working in the lumber department, the management wasn’t very cooperative and respective of time requested off."
good,Ups and downs as retail is competitive market is not f and internet that they could not sustain  changing so fave that they are leaving good people behind
good,"Lowe's originally was a good company. The longer I was there the worse it got. CEO at time didn't visit stores, therefore didn't fully understand or grasp what the business needed."
good,"Lowe's at times can be a great place to work, if you are single and do not have kids. The schedule is not conducive to any kind of lifestyle. One day you will close and the next you will open.or be a mid. Its very hard on your body to get into a routine."
good,"Certain members of management have had to take on more roles and oversee several extra departments. Departments that are now under staffed! Upper level management is either only concerned with numbers that they don't pay attention to how it effects the people on the floor. Oh, and the guys making the deliveries are so overwhelmed by the fact that their coworkers are so concerned about the sales, that they often work 10-12 hours a day. Often, being so overbooked that they become fatigued & injured. But, the company is saving money, right?"
good,They hire temporary help and kept your hours below full time when I was there 2 years ago. Unsure of management there now.  I see a few people who were there when I was there but they have been there for over 20 years.
good,If you want a schedule that is always changing and the management is not very accommodating than you should work here. Lowes as a whole is a great company but the store in Leesburg is not well run.
good,"I worked in a number of areas.  Started out bringing carts in from the outside.  Was moved to a garden associate.  Helped customers find their items and loaded them into their cars.  Worked in Electrical, cashier and helped clean and close the store."
good,In the beginning I was ecstatic to work at such a family and employee culture but the last year and a half the company culture had changed dramatically . The management were no longer engaged  and became a cold environment .
good,"The coworkers are great and the hours are flexible. The pay is decent for someone in school, but if you're looking to make good money you'll have to be management."
good,"Great atmosphere, great people, management ify, customer interaction some times positive some times negative. alot of heavy lifting and stressful days."
good,"This is my first experience to work in Canadian Company, its a totally different field that I worked before, but I learned a lot, with customers/ "
good,Haven't been there long enough to understand management's decisions but long enough to understand I'm merely a number in their system.Some managers are better than others in providing a helping hand but any learned skills come from working with other associates.
good,this place is an ok place to work. the management tho is not the best at time. they punish those who work hard and promote those who do not. just do your job and stay clear of trouble. easily said them done. and some times there is free cake
good,"on a day to day bases. its not to bad to work there.Uhave to kisses there butt if u want to move up. pay is close to min wage.health insurance I fair,but u pay a lot for it"
good,"I enjoyed everything about this job, but the retail hours. They also did not hire me as a full time employee after a year. I went in as seasonal and was moved to permanent part time."
good,I got severely sick while working with Lowes which required multiple trips to doctors offices and many days that I had to call out ill. The management did not handle that well and started cutting down my hours with excuses. Overheard stating they needed me to quit.
good,"When I first started with Lowe's there were a lot more incentive programs for associates.  Over the years, those programs have either disappeared or the thresholds have increased to an unattainable goal.  There are elaborate celebrations when milestones have been reached, and they do the best they can to keep the associates motivated while slowly taking away monetary incentives."
good,It was nice to have a little flexibility because of school. it was decent pay and most of the time had friendly co workers.  Typical corporate environment.
good,"Lowes is a great company,  they pay very well, not a hard job, but the upper management , regional management has no direction, no care , no leadership, they are not leaders, they are about numbers, and will work you , overwhelm you, stress you, exhaust you, they do not motivate their staff, very low moral, they will do underhanded things to cover their own mess ups. Im not saying every store is like this but the one in Hammond la is. Scheduling sucks, cant have a personal life if your full time. Not a job for family oriented person."
good,Lowes was a fun place to work for the graveyard shift. the hours were long and the pay was nothing but the co workers helped you make it through the day. I think they eliminated the overnight teams so I don't think this particular position is open anymore.
good,Is a good company to work for if you are young or like retail I have been there for almost a year and it's fine it does pay better than Home Depot I will say
good,"Loved the interaction with my customers, learning from some and passing it on to help others with their projects. I learned to be a better listener so as to assist somewhat novice beginners. Was allowed the freedom of working mostly without any ""interference"" from management. Most co-workers were pleasant and helpful at times, some better than others. By that I mean that some really didn't go out of their way to be team players.The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to do more of the work I wanted to  do. Maximum hours on some weeks were like twenty hours. For me , these days I would like 25/30 hrs. Having repeat customers come in  with pictures of their finished projects that I helped them prepare to do."
good,"the people are friendly and caring. the hours are always being cut at no advance notice. the management has to many favorites.    When you tell the personal/hiring person something, it is all over the store."
good,the worst part of the job is management they thank they know every thing and when our manager is off work or on vacation they have trouble finding sum one to go in with us that night.
good,"An enjoyable place to work."
good,"Typical Management Issues...Stores Understaffed for the Tasks Completion Required. Advancement was non-existent once you attained Store Managment Position."
good,Great experience with these guys just to much term oil and family member working in the same office.
good,To much work for the amount of Pay. OK management but they only see what is in front of them.
good,"A typical day at Lowes is first level troubleshooting for printers, pos terminals, and dummy terminals.  For technical computer problems that need hands on, I  dispatch venders to that store. I am a contractor for CITP.  I have 2 years of IT support desk help.  I have learned about networking, unix, and pc troubleshooting.  I enjoy my co workers the most on my job. We all have a way of working together to get the job done.  I am looking for a job where I can earn some more benefits.  I am only a contractor."
good,"I learned a lot, and found out that they only think of there selves (management)  I loved the costumers and i loved my job but i couldn't move up.and i never had a set schedule or at least 30 hours"
good,"Night-stocking is a fast-paced and productive job."
good,"assembling devices"
good,Great place to work if you enjoy helping people figure out the best way to fix a problem or upgrade something in their home. Not much affirmation other than customers.
good,Overall I loved working there because of the customers and co-workers. Management seemed like they were always out to get someone and not too friendly. Very shady. Not really a comfortable work place at times. Most of the time it was not all about the customer according to the way management handled certain situations. Alot of various childish gossip amongst one another and also VERY racist. Not everyone but most.
good,"this was a temp part time job,stayed busy,was not expected to stay only in your area needed to know more about the rest of store to help customers"
good,"This was a pretty fun place to work, all the associates were pretty nice, just make sure that the store manager likes you. or he will take you down- Work for any Lowe's, except for the on the Flower Mound!!!"
good,"Lowe's is like any large corporate America company . . . it has its ups and downs and will do anything to move ahead of the competition. The benefits do not compare to other companies - they need improvement. Lots of contractors and with the new IT office being built in Charlotte, lots of people expected to make the drive to Charlotte without increase in pay or benefits. No parking benefits."
good,"management never utilized the employees they had, they hired new employees and spread the hours thin. its great for a part time, a little extra money type job but not for living off of and thats one of the main reason i quit. i specified that i would need more hours because i need to be able to support myself and they cut my hours.i went from working 4-5 times a week ti working maybe twice a week, at most."
good,Lowe's should hire the proper amount of employees to cover customer needs. The employees work twice the normal work load and then get written up for not being faster. There are people that have to cover multiple departments and this does not allow for the best customer service. This also contributed to low employee moral.
good,"Lowe’s is a solid company going in the right direction. They are currently investing monies in selling systems, operating systems, and  logistics which are the most painful business operations at the moment."
good,"The management was pretty good, the hard thing is being a team and working on unloading a truck together. It's nice when all 4 people can get along and do the job, horrible is someone is grumpy. Hours started great, then jump off a cliff."
good,Can't believe anything management tells you about rolling over. Customers were nice. Loved working with the public. Hard work but customers made it fun. Some of the employees did also.
good,They are transitioning the company and don't seem to be doing it in an organized fashion. In addition some of the changes they are making make it hard to have a work and life balance.
good,The company policy is so vague that no one knows what the rules really are. worst communication I have ever seen. They brag about how much your store makes but still turn and cut hours. Promotions are who you blow not who you know. If you can deal with these people more power to you and welcome to the dysfunctional environment
good,"Was hired pt and these slave drivers would work you 40+ hrs one week then 20 hrs the next. Then they had me doin 40 hrs for weeks on end then all of a sudden drops to 18 hrs. Come to find out, by law if they work you 40 hrs or more for 13+ weeks they have to give you fulltime status & give you ft benifits. So they'd work me 40+ hrs 12 weeks & 18 the next just so the wouldnt have to change me to FT. Part timers get benifits too but obviously the fulltime benifits are better. All in all, its a great company to work for, they pay higher than most & p/t gets benifits. They got mad at me cause i broke my neck their & once they seen fit to terminate me....they jumped on it. But i sued them & won....just cant ever work for them again.....usually after 20 yrs tho that gets forgotten."
good,I am white and felt like I was the wrong color to work here. I quit after working at the Southeast Houston location for 4 years. The management is awful and corporate lets the manager run his store. No help from them.
good,Too much favorites with management to keep people with the proper skills  from advancing.   Fast paced customer driven work place with not enough people working to cover customer demand
good,"pros good bonuses music during work hours good team members that helped each other and worked together "
good,They are a typical regional distribution center they offer all the same benefits as any other but you better make friends with the bosses or you wont last long. The upper management does not want to hear about how poor the supervisors are out on the floor.
good,"I applied for full time employment and was hired as ""seasonal/ temporary"" with an supposed assessment after 90 days.  I'm not sure what the point of classifying people who want full time employment this way other than it excludes them from benefits.  As well I am being scheduled closing hours to at least 10:30 when I originally requested on the preferred hours sheet 6 am to 6 pm.  Other than these two things, which are major issues, I really like working at Lowe's.  Everyone is friendly and the customers are enjoyable.  It's a shame the overall satisfaction couldn't be complete by giving me the status and hours I applied for."
good,Manager is not the best hours are not consistent and schedule changes constantly (will change your schedule within a day without notification)  not allowing you to plan for appointments or events pay is good scheduled pay raise is on time annually
good,People are choosing for jobs & pay based on who they know and/or in relationship with. Pay is the same way too many unorganized managers. You have a few good managers who actually care about the well being of their employees. And then you have the managers who don't understand the value & life.
good,"Lowe's has great benefits but poor management at my last location. The mandatory inconsistent work shifts are a definite downside and the pay for head cashier rrole should be more,"
good,"I loved working at Lowe's, but the assistant manager I worked with was terrible. I think he's now the head manager at the location. "
good,"I love working for Lowes.  Love the people and the environment.  Unfortunately my position is being eliminated, therefore I will have to seek employment elsewhere."
good,"There was long hours standing behind the register. That was probably my least favorite part of the job. The mgmt. was very professional and they tried to make it fun. I learned how to differentiate certain types of wood and paneling, as well as take payments for the lowes credit card. Lowes had a diverse group of customers from vets to young families just starting out. I would recommend Lowes for anyone that may need a temp job through the holidays."
good,"I enjoy working at Lowes overall.  They do start you at a fair wage. The worst part about it is the inconsistent hours. They prefer to hire part timers, and it is difficult to land a full time position. The benefits are available, but mediocre at best."
good,"Each store has its own culture, that makes each store a different experience to work in. Most days are pretty routine, take care of the customers, keep the shelves stocked, keep the store tidy. There are days when co-workers can add strain to the workday and other days that you're glad to work with the people you do. Overall it's worth the experience you get from working with such a diverse group of individuals. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the customers that are so upset that they take out their frustrations on you, as if you personally are responsible for every wrong thing that's happened to them. On the other hand, there are some customers that come in and make your day. They either tell you a funny story or they're so appreciative of the level of help you were able to give them, those are the people that make it worth coming in every day."
good,"lots of constant major change every aspect right now, culture Is being turned upside down"
good,Married into the position. Young not very smart. Hires friends. Employees are robbing this store blind. Employees are damaging items to sell at a cheaper price. He hires young people with no work interests and lets go older people who actually show up and do the job. I wish them luck they need it.
good,"Loved working here, employees feel like family. Cashiers tend to dramatize the work life but the floor sales associates are great, management was alright some who were new to their position tend to be snappy and load tons of work on you but the higher up management was relatable and helpful. Store manager never got personal and seemed unaware of things going on at the workplace like repositioning employees and underlying issues."
good,"I love the job, the customers that I work with and my co workers, but sometimes the management is a bit lax. I would prefer if all rules applied to all employees."
good,the store has taught me to do my best no matter who is around you. you can not just sit and wait for things help out when ever you can and stay focus on the job
good,"Have to get in good with management though. If the managers didn’t like you work was terrible. Also night shift has to do almost everything for store 2555, day shift would leave freight everywhere and except nights to deal with it. Overall would recommend but only if you are good with the managers. Our night shift manager was one of the only good managers in the store."
good,"the only thing i had against Lowe's was it was hard to stand in place all day. If there were no customers you couldn't leave your register more than 10 feet away."
good,"The environment changed in the past year. I was hired to cover the Electrical dept. and if able to assist in the Hardware area."
good,"Typical retail environment. Associates run themselves ragged while managers sit in the office. It’s not what you know it’s who you know so all the wrong people get promoted. Departments are so short staffed, that they turn against each other and refuse to help one another. And of course it’s the typical high school drama and rumor mill. Good temporary job, wouldn’t recommend it long term."
good,"Great pay.  No real direction from management,  One person tells you to do one thing and the next tells you another. No longer room for advancement as they cut all department managers."
good,"as a cashier there, we need over rides often. all of the mods were either to busy or didnt feel like doing it. which left us cashiers with longer lines and angry customers. they dont have enough head cashiers. they would rather hap someone standing at the door than on a register so all the customers have to go to self check out. theres only one cashier at self check out. they dont treat there cashiers very well."
good,"Employees are encouraged to help out in other departments, which is fine, except that it results in a lot of neglect in your own area. That's not im9to then, what's important is is that you're seen in other departments."
good,"Learned how to use their register systems."
good,"Training/learning is offered, but very little time to train"
good,"Person in charge of head cashiers is very unfriendly...to the point of making you feel uncomfortable, generally no full time positions. Job is hard on the feet and back. Sometimes breaks and lunches are delayed or forgotten."
good,The store didn't care about their employees they only cared about the customer and money. Managment will bully you around. Tried to get problems solved and manages were not listening to what you were saying. Was labled as a complainer.
good,"This was a contract job, I didn't know how to properly merchandise product. Everyone I worked with were on a contract as well. Everyone was generally happy and able to help me find where products went."
good,Some of the young ASM's gave me the feeling that they were trying to get me out of my job...not as helpful as they should have been.  Sales associates were very helpful.
good,"Wonderful manager who works with you on everything from help in your department, to scheduling. Helpful employees and friendly environment! Customers can be rude at times, and forget that as a worker you are a person too and not a robot."
good,The management at Lowes is horrible especially the front end managers. They have no compassion for the employees they never take a second to understand their employees.
good,"not a healthy work/life balance, company struggling to adapt to the new retail online marketplace and employees suffering because of it."
good,I liked my time at Lowes and left that part time job to secure a steady work schedule with more hours and ultimately (who knows) better pay in the long run.
good,All the employees were very friendly. Very customer focused. The management put the customer above associates. The company is under staffed. This puts extra work on full time associates.
good,"Poor communication from higher up's. Department managers weren't really informed on what was happening with the people in their department from the higher up level. the department managers we're great, however the higher up's were distant and didn't really treat you as a person unless you'd been working there for years. Office politics pretty much dictate what happens with you, if a manager decides they don't like you they're trash talk you till you're gone."
good,"Flex Hours need to go, work same hours every day, be able to bid on other positions first. "
good,"The hours vary too much to have  good Job Work/Life Balance.  The health coverage is minimal, as are the other benefits.  There is no extra pay to work holidays,  The management leaves much to be desired."
good,"Morning shifts, mid-day shifts, closing shifts different every week.  No telling who you would be working with each week or day for that matter.  Weekends were mandatory."
good,"The lack of training cause issues across the board.  From top to bottom, issue needs to be address.  You are thrown to the wolves no matter your level in the company, then they blame you if you haven't figured it out."
good,"I worked third shift so, it wasn't that great for having a personal life. You sleep all day and work all night but, that being said that is what I picked. When I and the other night stockers got to work we usually had to go help the unloaders unload the truck because, they wanted to leave before the job was done and we needed the items off of the truck to be able to stock them which put us behind. When we got done unloading we got our pallets and took them to our department and stocked until our shift was over. Since we were cutting into OUR work time to do the unloaders job we weren't always able to get our stocking job done which resulted in us getting fussed at and having to work longer hours. Most of the time though everyone left instead of doing their job except for me and another person. Aside from that you do get an hour break and a set schedule with weekends off. I did learn how to run a Reach-Lift, Order-picker, and Forklift which hopefully will be a plus if I get another job that requires that experience."
good,"You deal with customers on a daily basis.  However management tends to be a problem with normal day work.  Most Management is ok, but some of the management wants to micromanage your jobs."
good,"Overall a decent place to work, lacking in benefits, advancement, and management is a bit rude. Most other associates are good, fair people, and usually fun to work with."
good,Stressful place to work as if you are a hard worker and accomplish your job you will be required to to do other peoples job.  Many tenured employees are expected to take on management type tasks without the pay.  Opportunity to move up if you are good at saying what Lowe's wants to hear in interview.  Experience plays very little into decision on whether you move up or not.  Offers competitive pay and good benefits.
good,lowes was ok but got old the longer you stay here. everything went downhill in an instant. I didnt hate working here but it tends to get difficult to move up unless you move
good,"Shifts are not too long, but the concrete floor and huge warehouse are tiring.  One break per shift, and no sitting while on the floor.  Learned a lot about the department in which i worked, but not much about other departments.  All employees begin at part time, and are promoted from within.  Work can be enjoyable or stressful, depending on co-workers.  Helping customers find what they are looing for in the hundreds of products can be very rewarding."
good,"Lowes as a whole is a great company. They have competitive wages and offer healthcare benefits, as well as, 401k, and paid vacation and holiday time. ."
good,I liked all the things in lowe's except they laid of people. They could have tried to place people in different dept. They also can increase the sales for the company with diffrent methodology.
good,"I had to push carts with heavy lumber and other supplies to cars"
good,"I worked at a Lowe's for almost four years. I was a sales specialist, tried to move up the ladder but it never happened. The management team could be a bit condescending because they think they can do your job better than you can do your job. In almost four years I was not super happy about the yearly raises everyone but the last was better than before then all of a sudden it dropped to less than I had ever received before at Lowe's."
good,"This is a good company to work for but, because of the pay structure for management, it leaves way too much at the whim of store manager who will be more concerned with their own position than what is necessarily beneficial to the store and it's employees."
good,"Good place to work with some good associates, was forced to changed my job to a different job than hired which i take as a bad go.  Was hired on as an overnight stocker, that was changed about 4 months after on to day stocking because of sales.  The schedule change didn't work well with family but had to adjust family for job needs.  Overall management was good and direct supervisors were all good with adjusting to new people and change on a constant.  Favorite part of the job was the chance to do different things through the store that i wouldn't normally do on a daily.  Stocking products was primary job responsibility.  Hardest part of job was having to deal with other co-workers that didn't want to do their job  so i had to do their job for them to help customers which isn't apart of my job duties."
good,"high paced, always changing, workers become your seconded family. management is a hit or miss depending on your location, major changes in the company right now. getting to meet new people and help them is the best part of everyday."
good,"The company pays well enough, but has recently restructured the workforce which put many out of work.  There is a change for permanent employment, but full time employment is a challenge to obtain.  The benefit, insurance wise, are overpriced for what you receive."
good,"Breaks would sometimes never be offered. I'm a 8 hour work day you were supposed to recive 3 breaks, 15min break after 2 hours of being there, 1 hour lunch, another 2 hours later, and two hours before you go home another 15min break. "
good,Lowes was a great company as far as it's career opportunities and moving up. Management needed a few changes since favoritism was quick to take over my store. Coworkers were great and the job itself was amazing.
good,I enjoyed the workplace. just long hour work days. The 12-13 hour days were rough. It took as long to walk to the lunch break room then you were aloud to sit and eat
good,"Since I work for myself - this gives me an opportunity to always have my mind refresh.  I work with a lot of Hand Tools, Air Tools. I explain everything to customers, Tile, Electric, Paint, Locks, Lights and some gardening. "
good,I learned a lot at Lowe's. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help every single customer and satisfy them completely.
good,"I met some really nice people here everyone i worked with were very educated and smart. Good people no drama. "
good,"I usually arrive 30 minutes early, relax in break room, clock in, read company emails. Advise assistant head cashier of my presents, find out which register to sign in to.  Interact with customer with their purchases. Hardest part of job is lifting heavy boxes of merchandise to deactivate the security tag. I really like with face to face with customers."
good,"The overall work environment is good, but having to work flex hours is very difficult,"
good,"Lowe's is a great place basically only because I'm surrounded by other miserable happy people. If you want to spend 10 years becoming a manager then its a great job.  Hours are tough. Could close at 12, open at 6. Must work weekends. Very little training. Little or no change when it's a consistent problem. Easy fixes but problem solving is limited due to corporate stronghold.... yup."
good,My day at this job when i had it was that all the co workers there were so racist about the customers or hated them for something little that didn't matter. it was really awful and also there was way to many groupies and people that liked to kiss other peoples booties. i didn't like that at all cause i was the type to go do my job not be a groupie and go home and enjoy my day with my family. the best part of my day was going home and waiting very patintally for my pay day
good,Lowe's is a great transition company. The day to day challenges makes it exciting. Customer interaction is great. On the job training
good,The company is a good company. The problem is that most middle mgmt. or ASM's have detached themselves from the employee culture and do not communicate well on the floor and have forgotten to help the customers.
good,"It's okay, a typical day is just dealing with customers and working to the best of your abilities. As with most jobs the key part is being able to go home and see your family."
good,This was by far one of the most enjoyable jobs i have had. Co workers where amazing. Management on the other hand wasnt. Managment promised me for 4 years advancement but then utalized me for other positions that i was qualified for.
good,"same routine everyday everyone is drained and tired learned how to use heavy machinery management is not the best all look down on co workers hardest part handling call outs and people quitting"
good,Nice place to work. Management was very poor. Pay not that good
good,A typical day at Lowes is difficult at times. You have to go into work knowing that anything can happen. In the morning you come in and schedule the cashiers breaks and lunchs. And then someone calls off and you have to re- do the break schedule. You need to make sure all the drawers are put out and the store is ready to go before the store opens. All day you have to keep your cashiers on task and make sure every customer is receiving adequate service. Also while setting end caps and taking care of any customer issues. At close you need to make sure all drawers are pulled and secured. While making sure all paperwork has been processed and the store is clean and ready for the next business day.
good,"A typical day at work included running around like a chicken with it's head cut off. No other department, whether associate or management, was willing to help or direct others to help you when needed. There are a set of policies and procedures, but scratch that. Management throws that set out the window to ""appease all customers"" because they are too worried to upset a customer so they basically hand the store over to the customer for free. I learned an ancient computer system that required daily phone calls to tech support to get them to work. I also learned if you want to get a task completed, do it yourself because no one will help you. Co-workers was probably the best part of the job. Creating and maintaining friendships made the day pass by as long as you weren't caught chatting with another associate during the day. The hardest part of the job was trying to run a store on a skeleton crew while still completing all the tasks of your job title. The enjoyable part of the job was talking to other associates."
good,All the people there were nice to work with. Customers were interesting to help.
good,"Always kept me on my toes"
good,everything is nice about this place from my point of view but cutting corners to make more money is inevitable and its always at the associate's expense. the other associate's are very team based which is great but the managers only seem to care about themselves. the hardest part of this job is being lied to by management about you being promoted. the most enjoyable part is your team everyone will help you when you need it they are always there to help you with information about things you know little about and can make for a calming work day even if the customers are in herds.
good,"Work only four or three hours a day, scanning empty holes where inventory was. During that time give out sheets of the missing inventory to departments and put in data regarding what was missing. Help customers find what they are looking for and help give them ideas of what else they can do. I have learned how to do a live inventory also how to make and print tags that are missing or need to be changed. The hardest part of the job is the communication with some coworkers who wont listen to me. Also  gong from working 39 hours a week to 15 hours a week. Most enjoyable part is knowing that what I do is importation to the company and knowing that I can help someone."
good,"very under staffed, management do not have there heads on straigate"
good,Rough managemnt
good,"I absolutely love Lowe's. I've wanted to work there since I was really young, and while it's a fun place to work with great employees, there are a lot of promises made that aren't kept. One thing is for sure, if you're hired on the front end, you will never leave. I would love to work on the floor and have applied for positions, but never get the opportunity."
good,"Very mis managed. For last 6 months always worried about being fired for something stupid, and I was."
good,Gained intellegence to succed in my future. Easy and friendly customers on a daily basis. Management never lead me into the right direction. The hardest part was scheduling around school which caused me to take off too many days.
good,"All of the customers enjoy shopping this store due to the knowledgeable employees and cleanliness of the store. The work day goes by quickly, keeping your work area clean and neat is a priority, customers are the top priority. The down side of the job is the company policy of temporary or seasonal jobs with no advancement. Once the ninety days are over they don't tend to keep the good employees, instead they hire new employees and spend three more weeks training. Seems a waste of good manpower."
good,Not much room for advancement being a contractor. Long work hours. Great staff
good,steady workload. always kept busy. felt very much apart of a team.
good,"In the five and a half years of my employment at Lowe's, I found my experience within the company to be satisfying, but yet not really rewarding with a lack of opportunities for advancement."
good,It’s a good job it has some struggles that go along with it you have some nice people some mean people but it has a lot of good quality about it like working outside with the plants
good,I believe that the company is moving in the right direction but it will take some time before it reaches the store level.  Attitudes need to be improved and Management needs to be trained in management skills.  People should be held accountable.  The pay could also be improved.
good,"Lowe's is a good company to work for, If you are going to school or needing a part time job. I did advance from a specialist to a manager in 2.5 years. The associates at my store are fantastic."
good,This is a great place to work however at the present time the company CEO is more concerned with how much he makes and how much the shareholders make and really not concerned at all with the employees and until that culture changes I would not recommend in working for this company
good,"Coworkers were great but there was a bad manager that would ruin your day, the work could be very physically demanding, such as lift multiple 80lb bags on Quikrete or 5-gallon buckets of joint compound. other than that is was a lot of walking."
good,Lowes has gone through some changes in the past two years that has turned the environment sour. The communication between managers and employees is not good.
good,Your experience is based on your location. In one state it was outstanding! Mangers actually paid attention to those who wanted to move up and provided opportunities and proper direction. In another seem to be the opposite but thats just been my experience. This is as a manager as well as specialist. Still like the company as a whole even with the constant changes.great benefits though.
good,At first I was hesitant on taking this job for bad experiences in the past but I was able to have a better experience with this one. They are flexible with my school schedule and I’ve been very great full
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe’sbut I was promised a specialist position once available.. I brought in 96 credit card accounts threw my Property management ties from 3 states .. brought in bid project.. worked as a specialist "
good,They don't take previous experience into account and simply place you where they want you. My resume was never read. Managers were unaware that I had years of previous forklift experience.
good,Not necessarily a hard job but management and sales people cause too many issues as far as customer satisfaction and too many changes on the fly that we have to accommodate.
good,This company provides decent benefits and room to move up or change deoartments. All positions are physically demanding and require a lot of activity.
good,"To begin with it was a great place to work but slowly overtime you just have more and more added to your plate with the expectation that you will remain optimistic and still complete every task at hand. This just creates stress for everyone leading to a toxic environment. However, the people that work there are very friendly and do their very best to help. Its a great place to be if you can stay on your toes and keep up with a lot of changes."
good,Great place to get a lot of experience but little to no room to move up unless you completely pander to the management above you. Overall not worth it as the work-life balance is not good.
good,"Though Lowe's is a great place to work management is horrible, they ask for ideas from employees then give no credit and take the credit, they always hide so when you need them you cant find them, then you have to come up with something even if its not true, just so the customer is not waiting around for hours. The store manager has no regards for anyone or their feelings, just wants what he wants. Customer service desk never answers the phone and when they do they send you to the wrong department. Other than those things Lowe's is not a bad place just usually the people and it can induce high levels of stress."
good,"Lowe's isnt a bad place to work its just very dull. Its a manual labor desk job. Watch for heavy machinery, and trust me wear steel toed shoes no matter what position you work in at one point you're going to move equipment. If your in warehpuse wear a backbrace just in case becaude you will exceed in lifting over 200 lbs at somr point or another because of lack of space."
good,Good company to work for.  I was always treated with respect from management.  Co-workers become family and you stick together.  Need thick skin with customers.
good,Decent pay some of it is hard work. If you have good managers then things go smoothly if not it can be chaos.  They hire you full time for the spring and summer after summer they lay you off or cut your hours so bad that you have to find something else. The store I worked at had horriable managers. Some has been fired since but they had their click.
good,Nice place to work if you need the money. Retail takes a special kind of person to truly make it their career. My experience was very positive customer interactions and management support. This is not always the case though.
good,"When I first started at Lowes it was going okay, it was the usual retail job, the managers dont know how to communicate one manager says A, another manager says B. They have you doing a million and one things. They try to have you do(or help) other people in other departments. They are a mess.."
good,"A typical day at customer service will include completing online orders, reaching out to customers to help them schedule deliveries, I was responsible for keeping our area tidy and assisting customers in a timely fashion. I had to greet every customer as they came in the door and answer the phone within two rings. Memorizing policies and delegating to co-workers was also part of my job"
good,"Flexible, good job for Students, retired people, and to make extra income. Management is not always the Best, but they don't micromanage their emoloyees"
good,"22 years overall with Lowes.  Most of these were great....I learned a great deal and had supportive management truly intent to help you grow and move up within the company if it was your wish.  They say it takes one bad manager to ruin a career.  Unfortunately, I found the bad manager.....pushing constantly, never enough, scheduled to work overtime as the position was salary and could never get enough done.  My health is worth more than a job. The facility manager was awesome.  Unfortunately, he was not my direct manager."
good,"too many young don't want to work. managers don't know anything, rules arbitrarily applied, understaffed and management does not care, you can cover 3 departments and get yelled at because you are not in 3 places at once.  Jerk customers"
good,They/ Lowe's/ the management expected way too much out of their part time employees and full time employees for what they are paying. Once they had to cut the hours of the part-time employees there were many part-time people who left because they were unable to pay their bills with what they were getting paid. This occurrence caused the full-time employees to be very stressed out and thus a couple of them left too.
good,A typical day is customer focused and fast paced.  Currently it is under major corporate changes and this can be a challenge.  However it is a goo experience for anyone who has not had  time in a corporate environment.
good,"I loved working here. The problem was poor leadership. My manager had little knowledge of and product I had to work with and sell, but had me and others change things to his specific wants instead. Now I can understand managers trying to lead and all that, but when customers become regularly upset by the process maybe talk to another person before continuing. After I left I found that my manager had been fired and wanted to return, but that was made impossible before he left."
good,Lowe's was a great part time job that gave me extensive experience while I was in college full time. I would have considered further career opportunities post graduation had the working hours be more flexible.
good,job as management is very hard and alot of hours. always a change in culture because it is a retail environment. room to grow and move.  Can be hard to train there
good,Some days were busy and some were not.  When we didn't have customers as a cashier we cleaned our work area and well as the front end.  Also stocked the front merchandise.  Irate customers were the hardest.  Enjoyed checking out the regular customers.
good,I first started at Lowe's and I enjoyed working there. At that time I wanted to advance in the company so I learned as much as I could. I have applied for several full time jobs there and was never even considered. I felt like I wasn't appreciated so I put my 2 weeks notice and moving to San Antonio to try and look for a full time job while I finish school
good,"my job was to load customers after they would leave the store but i would also have to do other things at work working other departments. i would often do the job of others, people that would claim they where to busy. i am the go to guy when people need something done in the store."
good,"great place to work for, managers were unorganized, very hard to get clear instructions from managers. If the management was more organized, then it would have been the perfect place to work for."
good,"Thankfully, I worked at one of the top-performing stores for the company. We do have problems related to our physical store being smaller than is needed for the amount of sales that we do. Communication can be very spotty. Training is minimal. Hours are shortened for part time and seasonal hours during the holidays and after the spring/summer seasons."
good,Great place to work if you can handle the pressure and hours. Safety is of huge importance. 11 hour days wouldn't be so bad if there was time away to complete tasks that are mandatory.
good,"I liked it for the most part take the wages for example they were pretty good and there was plenty of work to done,but when it came to the training of certain employees they where lacking."
good,I enjoy the work and the customers. I do a lot of home improvement projects so I like to see what people are buying and ask about their project and learn new things.
good,"As an associate for several years, I watched the local Loveland Lowe's deteriorate slowly. The culture changed along with company moral. Among may of my co- workers a common bantering of horrific changes in management, along with poor management decision making led to many disgruntled employees. Many unsatisfied with the changes in management along with a culture change, that focused more on individual efforts than the entirety of the store. High turnover rates remain and management continues to lead poorly."
good,i use to work for home depot loved it i liked lowes a lot it wasn't bad it was a normal job enjoyed it they pay well have great insurances it is a lil stressful depending the volume of customers but nothing major0
good,"It was a good company to work for at times, but management and compensation made it difficult to enjoy the job. Overall, I would recommend Lowe's to a friend, but not the certain store I worked at."
good,While employed at Lowe's any day that I would arrive could be very different depending on the people I was working with as well as what managers were there.
good,If you are wanting to find a company to work for at a young age to get on your feet Lowes offers great hours mainly afternoon and evening shifts. very friendly co workers
good,"Its' not bad if you:"
good,"Training program for product knowledge was very good.  "
good,Rotation shifts- no work life balance - CPO is still growing and has a lot of work to do. The workload can be very overwhelming at times. The quarterly bonuses are great when they were achieved
good,This specific store will keep you at seasonal for as long as they can. They will give you no direct answer as to when you will advance and will avoid said conversation at all cost. The benefits seem to be ok but are only available for part-time and full-time staff.
good,It was ok place for first seven only because people was there in last two years it's went down hill. And knew management I don't it was time go in ways.
good,Lowes provides a safe and efficient workplace environment for the jobs asked of you. They provide you with the necessary licenses and training to ensure you are never at risk.
good,Lowes is a company that used to be a better place to work.  Managers can make the environment a great place to work or a difficult place to work.  There is a lack of accountability for associates who choose to show up late and not carry their fair share of the work.  This is frustrating to those who have a strong work ethic.  Many of us will only stay until we find another job.
good,"A typical day for me would be assisting customer's with their purchases. Backed up cashiers as needed, and maintaining my department. Stocking,cleaning, and all other duties as assigned by management."
good,I started here when I was 19 and its a good first starter job to introduce you to the working field. You learn a lot very quickly and you learn more than you think you will.
good,The actual work was more about keeping inventory in check and clean as well as help with customer if asked to. It was so great having a job where the manager and other coworkers made sure I was getting a break every 2 hrs. How they told me I was not getting a full-time was very subtle and vague. They gave me 2 weeks notice and made me sign something. And I miss my coworkers who I see from time to time and tell me they miss working with me and vice versa. It was also nice having the option to do some volunteer work around the community.
good,your usually watching a few departments at a time. High paced environment.Fast paced. Holding three phones and handling multiple customers.Driving equipment.
good,The work is easy and doesn't require a lot of skills. The managers seem to listen and take value in their workers. There is a lot of room moving up at least at the lowes i worked at.
good,This place was alright to work at for a short period of time or if you are attempting to just get work experience. The opportunity for promotion is non-existent.
good,Just do your job and keep it moving ... management is steady changing and there is a bit of favoritism shown often but other than that its a great place to work for the time being...
good,80% tasking and 20% customer service. Should be flipped.
good,Assist customer with the product and finding information for there product. Bilingual for Spanish and English. Stocked product according to inventory.
good,"Learned a lot about new products. Very much liked the discount."
good,"I worked here for about a year. management wasn't friendly, most of the time, but we got alone. I did my job and a great job. I helped customers in various ways, showing them where products were, to loading up"
good,Only this one has people that act like they are in high school. If you aren't in the click you will be written up and fired for no reason. It is also a hostile work enviroment.
good,Management made it difficult to enjoy my time at work. Felt highly criticized and under trained as a new employee. Work environment was boring and i did not enjoy my time there.
good,"I loved designing, but felt pressured to make sale. There was always down-stocking, up-stocking, and other customers from other depts looking for assistance which made it challenging to complete each design on time. Flex schedule made family time difficult to attain."
good,needs more management not enough communication between employees. not enough pay for the hard work we do. all employees are not on the same level........
good,"Love working for Lowe's to an extent. Just really hard being so young in a crowd that is older. But other than that, I feel respected and it's a great job to have."
good,"This was your standard retail job. "
good,"Review delivery schedule on computer to determine items to build.  Assemble using hand or power tools. Pull items from warehouse with power equipment. Clean up work area, compact cardboard and trash."
good,This is a retail environment.  The company has a lot of struggles financially.  Continues to reduce labor through cut backs and lay-offs.  Has extremely old computer systems for maintaining client and business needs.  Training program is excellent but execution is poor.     Fewer labor in a customer service business increases theft and inventory loss.  Very weak inventory control program.  Inventories only once a year and then can be manipulated by the on hand management.
good,I loved working in the seasonal dept and being on my feet and continue talking to customers and feeling helpful. The job pace was quick and that's what I enjoyed most.
good,the people are nice to work with. some of the bosses where nice some just made it a nightmare to work for telling you I'm going to fire you everyday. the assistant store manager took you to his office and would scream at the top of his lungs at you. couldn't stand it.
good,The most enjoyable part of working for them was the teamwork and family feeling among co-workers.The most difficult part was lack of communications .At times the mood swings of the store was difficult to deal with pertaining to customers.
good,As a delivery driver the hours are ok but the time off is on a stupid rotation and it gets stupid. Promises are made to customers that are constantly counter to policy or just unsafe. You are the focal point of all the negativity and it really feels at times the company is looking for ways to get rid of you over stupid stuff. Corporate think has fully infected Lowes and if you use logic you will not be there long. They do a good job of trying to work around schedule needs but sometimes the long hours and heavy hand deliveries are just too much.
good,"Working for Lowe's has given me the experience and knowledge necessary to seek new, advanced, opportunities with new companies.  The cap on advancement within Lowe's is the main reason I would leave the company."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with shoppers.  The hardest part of working at Lowes was the horrible schedule.  It was never consistent and made it hard to have a normal life outside of lowes.
good,If you are looking for retail experience lows is a great small store to start. Management can be in your face sometimes but it depends on how you handle that if you like it or not..
good,"Some of the management staff was good though others were allowed to be rude and target other staff.  Benefits are good, but hours are horrible.  It breaks up a lot of marriages because you rarely get to see your family."
good,Not a very hard job but can be physically demanding at times. Must have great customer service and being handy is a plus. Just because you work in one department doesn't mean you wont be asked to work in others and perform tasks you have no training in.
good,"Manager do not communicate with each other wich makes it hard for the employees to do what each one of them wants them to do."
good,"A typical day at work, in the delivery department, lasts quite a long time. Six in the morning until about four or five is the average. The company does not permit delivery drivers to leave until all of the day's deliveries are completed. While the work itself is not terrible, and the company as a whole is mostly agreeable; working under these conditions is not for everyone."
good,I loved the customer base at Lowes but the Upper Management made it very hard to work there because they dont care about employees at all. Not allowed to be sick ever... even with medical documentation. inhumane
good,"I worked in the lumber department at Lowes and a typical day is very busy. I think the lumber department is the toughest job at lowes, as you are picking up heavy materials all day long. I learned a lot about the different types of building materials and what is needed to complete certain types of projects. In my experience the management wasn't as good as it could've been. It seemed as though random employees were pushed to management positions without really knowing what they needed to do in those positions. While I enjoyed my time at Lowes because of the other employees in my section, the management was one of the downsides. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know the other guys in my department."
good,"I enjoyed working for this Company; I felt working at Lowes like my second home, that's why I keep hopping to return, again as employee!!  I miss working at Lowes?"
good,"The people I worked with and the customers that I interacted with is what kept me working there as long as I did. Most of the management they had in place made it very apparent that they did not care for the employees as much as they said they did, although there were a few exceptional ones. As far as the day to day work process went, it was very engaging, and even the most routine things seemed to change based on each day and the flow of supply and demand."
good,My position here was a temporary postion so i knew it wasnt gonna last long. I liked working here because i love cashier work and working with others. Lowes stayed busy and I liked that becaue i never had a chance to get bored.
good,"Loved working with the store manager and a lot of the people at Lowes. They wouldn't let people work the shifts that would fit their lifestyle more. Meaning mothers, morning shifts so they could be out with their kids after school. Younger adults that disliked getting up early because they stay up late. They flip/flopped the shifts so you couldn't even get used to it and have a sleep routine which is unhealthy. It's too bad because they are losing their best Customer Service Associates because of it. I would still be there if they would have worked with me."
good,Don't really have a review.. just time to move on. It's very ahrd to advance in this company... To become full time is very hard to do........................................................
good,"its great to do work experience here if you are looking for experience helping customers and general admin duties."
good,Worked in the electrical department helping customers and stocking shelves. Night shift we received trucks and had to unload them and help other departments separate the truck and deliver the items to the correct departments.
good,"The people I worked with were fantastic, but the supervision wasn't the best. Overall, it was a great learning experience for the type of professional career I am looking for long term."
good,"Work schedules are rotating shifts for most full-time associates which is not ideal for family. Learned a lot from my first store. Management is very different from store to store with priorities varying from one manager to another. Favoritism is problematic in some stores. Time management is the hardest part of the job, trying to complete daily tasks and order and follow up on customer's projects. Overall a good company to work for."
good,Most of my day was spent trying to follow up to make sure product was ordered and shipped.  Specialty sales were very undependable and management was so thin they could barely keep up with keeping the store clean on top of the remainder of their duties.
good,"Very fast paced environment. Everyone helps out with situations. Stressful at times because of irate customers. Co workers are great, management is not 100% helpful."
good,A typical day at work would include moving around from inside to outside registers. I covered coworkers breaks and also did carts from time to time. Coworkers were nice but management was very poor.
good,"Company is good to work around personal/family obligations. They provide vacation  time for part time employees at 50% of what full time people earn; however, there is no sick time for part timers. Part timers do have the option to limit availability whereas full time employees must have open availability."
good,I really enjoyed working there I should of never of left.  If I didn't move I would still work there today.  I would recommend this job to anybody GREATNESS!!!
good,Management asks too much of employees for their wrongdoings. Would not recommend this as a workplace for a delivery driver. Long days and the work schedule is very complicated and needs to be fixed. The out going deliveries each day varies so badly and is not managed that somedays are very short and days very long.
good,"A typical day at work, you would come in and have a daily meeting on the progress that is being made. You are to make sure your stations are presentable for customers to shop. You assist customers with any concerns they may have on there home improvement. Suggest what they may be able to utilize to for whatever project they may be working with. Once your done always try to walk the customer up to the register so that they had the full friendly great customer service experience."
good,"Help customers select the right items for their project. Keep the shelve's stocked.  Put away frieght."
good,"In typical day I help customers with: finding a part for a lawn mower, locate an item, stock shelves, call customers for orders, help with internet orders, and basic customer service."
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work. Or used to be. Show up on time, just pick something looks like it needs work and work on it. Connect with a manager and your good. Be ready to change pace and project, on the fly!"
good,"None that I care to share since my experience with this particular store were very unfavorable.  You take your chances when you start with any company; however, I will not take threats and stay with a company."
good,"The work place is such a fun place to be!"
good,My typical day at work consisted of handling the cash register.  I spoke to different customers and suggested different products to conform to their needs.
good,"I liked working here, but to receive a good or fair pay raise was obsolete. Then I got only the evening shift that I didn't care for because at the time I had young children at home."
good,Nice company to work for good benefits.  I enjoyed my position as department manager until it was eliminated.  I am currently working on the sales floor as an associate.
good,Lowes was accommodating to my class schedule while I was in college.  I had opportunity to work in a few different departments and gained experience both career-wise and socially.  Interacting with customers from all walks of life needing assistance with a variety of issues/concerns expanded my communication skills.
good,"physically demanding... not enough time to take  breaks ( not all ). If your capable of doing the mule work, you may never move up.. because it's to hard to replace you with the low wages they are willing to part with."
good,"its a retail workplace good co workers. Learn different things"
good,"I loved working with the customers and helping them out with there needs,i also love working with the employes of the company on training and learning new thing"
good,"hard work, with good pay. very nice people work there and the managers are good. i dont know what else you want me to say. a typical day is waking up and going to work"
good,"Lowes as a company is a one-sided corporation. All the benefits are geared towards the corporate leveled employees. Example: Lowes offered discounts to all of it's working employees for new vehicle purchases, but only through BMW. So the average employee, the ones actually in the store generating the sales that keep the stores going, could not even afford the insurance on the vehicles, only the corporate leveled people (the ones deciding the benefits status) could benefit from it. Not really room for advancement, and hard work and knowledge are not rewarded. You get promoted based off of how good of a brown noser you are."
good,The biggest problem is communication from the top of management to the sells floor but its going to happen when one person hears something and then tells another and the process goes on and on until the facts are lost. But there are a lot of great people at Lowe's to work with and everyone is very understanding. So over all its not a bad place to work. If the management communication would improve just a little bit it would be a great place to work
good,"To many ""flavor of the months"" and horrible training. No building of a bull pen to promote with in . Wasteful and a time wasting company with most of their programs."
good,"There is a great deal of team work where everyone helps everyone else with challenges and hiccups.  It is a great family environment, i.e. special meals -- potlucks-pizza--barbecues. Healthy environment is very important with free annual health screenings."
good,"The people at Lowes are good people. The majority of the management staff at Lowes, I feel, doesn't really care about their people."
good,"Lowe's family is just that a family. Work enviroment is nothing but down to earth.  We work together to make our store inviting to our customers.  Our employees are helpful and will go the extra mile to assist the needs of the customer. "
good,The Management is really poor its the blind leading the blind where I work. Overall it is a great work environment I just really don't like the way they run things. With any situation the store manager usually did the most illogical things to solve issues. Lowes needs to seek out better suited managers to run their stores.
good,"Resolve customer complaints via phone, email, mail, or social media, Use telephones to reach out to customers and verify account information, Greet customers warmly and ascertain problem or reason for calling, Utilize computer technology to handle high call volumes, and Work with customer service manager to ensure proper customer service is being delivered."
good,"The opportunities are there if you apply yourself. It is all on you to complete your training and become who you want to be."
good,"Generally understaffed any given day, due to poor management/lack of employees/denial of overtime, extremely stressful on a regular basis."
good,It was a fairly standard big box retail environment. The only real exception was the management at my location they turned a once great job into something that was worse than a nightmare.
good,"The upper level management leaves much to be desired. The atmosphere was always tense. There were too many Chiefs and not enough Indians. However I was cross-trained is every department. I have gained useful knowledge from my customers. I have dealt with plumbers, electricians, carpenters, landscapers, farmers, contractors, and I always walked away with more knowledge. The front end operations were very hectic and breaks were few and far between. This was a labor intensive job but I did keep in great shape. When training someone new to the floor, I made sure to note what they seemed to enjoy doing and tried to delegate tasks to the right worker. This is a more productive management style that gives workers a sense of accomplishment and self worth."
good,"Great company going in the right direction, fun place o work. Work life balance ok. Pay and benefits good.Great feeling helping customers love where they live."
good,High sales store. Cash control was a very intense operation. You stayed on the run all day which made the day go faster. Was able to use experiences from all my jobs to excel.
good,"Nothing of note. A day here was as expected. Co-workers were friendly and personable, and the ones who had been there longest were knowledgeable of the way things were done. Hardest part of the job was the extended hours, but compensation was fair."
good,We have had very rude customers at times but we learned to still be nice to everyone no matter how rude. I liked that I got to learn different things in the store and about each section.
good,"It's a good place to work with great co-workers and management in place to help you when needed. There are a lot of politics to deal with at times, but it is a big box store so that comes with the territory. It's always a good feeling to be able to help customers with their needs and answering their questions."
good,"Good Company to work for, good benefits, decent incentives, decent  insurance, management, management, management, management, management"
good,"everyday at Lowe's is a learning experience that is what I loved about it. when you are a cashier you think that you know all there is to know about running a register but, that is not true. I have learned so much at Lowe's. the hardest part of the job was getting people to respond to my code 50's and code 1's. It is hard being a cashier when you have an irritated customer that is ready to go home after shopping and they have to wait on us."
good,"Lowes at one point in time was a great company with a clear direction on who their customer was. However the strong desire to chase Home Depot and its commercial base is proving to be more than difficult. Lowes customer is female based, catering to home décor with lumber and heavy construction only occupying 1/4 of the store. Observing Home Depot market share continuing to grow, Lowes is trying to chase a different customer looking to get a portion of the Home Depot business. In doing this Lowes has forgotten what business made them successful in the market place. As a result we see Lowes stores closing and reduction in work force at a store level creating customer service issues, and store stocking issues."
good,"none it served it's purpose , the management need's more work."
good,"nice clean place ,well organized, should pay more to people with experienced in the operation of warehouse equipment.."
good,"When I first started at Lowes, it was a great place for a long time. Good management and coworkers worked as a team. At the end we got new management. Moral went down."
good,Enjoyed working with fellow cashiers/customer service team. management was not fair and did not treat employees well.
good,"ok place to work, great place not enough pay. Management could be better on lower levels."
good,"A typical day at work is solving customer needs and  increasing value to their purchases."
good,i like interacting with the customers but i didnt like the pay and didnt have insurace
good,"Enjoying customer satisfaction."
good,"Terrible place to work, management was bad ,pay was not good"
good,Initially Lowe's was a great company to work for. I was promoted quickly to the department manger role. How ever. the opportunity for further advancement went away with company restructuring and eventually my Lowe's career coming to an end when I was given a severance package that I had to take.
good,"upper management was not very helpful when asked"
good,"Great work environment. I have worked at 4 different Lowes stores and all have been the same as far as organizational culture. The only drawbacks are the retail schedule and having to keep a flexible open availability. Not too many permanent full time positions available, but if you have time to devote to building a career of it then this is a great company to move up within. As a part time worker, benefits are absolutely terrible and not worth investing in. Customers and management are usually pretty cool to work with."
good,"No work life balance. You get to work at 12p store closes at 11p you would not leave before 12a and have to be back at 5am,"
good,"I've always wanted to work for a company that help the community and show people how easy it can be to do projects them self's instead of paying a high priced contractor to do it for you."
good,"Special orders daily"
good,Enjoyed working with the public. Enjoyed helping customers find the materials they needed.
good,".- Typical day would consist of basic Customer interaction on needed products and special orders to apply to their specific needs financially and professionally. "
good,At the end it was different. Ok something different every day. Ok. Co-workers are great. The every day changes from the days before. Coming to work
good,I have enjoyed working for Lowes its been a great environment to learn more about all the different trades and all the tools they use.
good,go into work unload trucks and stock merchandise on shelves
good,A typical day involved loading and driving merchandise to customers home and then installing and setting up product. explain to the customers how the merchandise is used if needed and provide excellent customer service.
good,"As far as Retail Sales go, Lowe's is a great Company to work for. They have good benefits and pay. They're is not much room for advancement and some of the decisions management makes are strange, but if your looking for entry level work, this is a good place to start"
good,"good company to work for , hours are very bounced , benefits are great, pay is average for experienced"
good,"Lowes is a great job for working through college, but i would like a fulltime job. A typical day at work consists of going in to unload a freight truck."
good,"Performs inventory of equipment (large appliances)"
good,Not a bad place to work. Could use better management. Sometimes hard to get hours. Management and employees need to communicate better then do. Management is very up tight on scale 1 to 10 of management understand employees is a 5
good,You have to be willing to take it upon yourself to learn and seek out information. They provide you with enough information to do a basic job. Its only when you encounter a specific problem or customer concern that you will find some of the training to be inadequate. The less you know the less they have to pay you. Departments are run properly and everyone knows what they have to do. Management I found not to be to helpful.
good,Typical day: long hours; learned a lot of home improvement knowledge; Managers were secretive and rarely promoted your personal growth.Co- workers ranged from super to extremely difficult. Hardest was dealing with politics and difficult employees.
good, 
good,Helping customers find what they need and make their experience great. Provide information on how to repair items where to find items and ordering items on the computer. Took phone calls and directed them to the correct places. The hardest part of the job was the concrete floors. 
good,"Management was a different story, not everyone on the same page. "
good,Long hours and will let you go at any moment for just about anytime. 
good,"Lowes had its good times and bad but most were bad. Management had attitudes everyday, plotting against you. You never knew what you were gonna be faced with each and everyday."
good,A typical at work would require you to help each and every customer. You have to make sure they have a
good,I was very excited and proud at first to work there but after a while you realize that the management team is out for themselves and who cares who they step on to get there. I have also realized it is only who you know that makes it possible for you to move up. A person off the street has the same opportunity as someone who has worked there for years.
good,Communication and coaching are next to zero. Questions about issues and/or process is held against you during review time.
good,Mangement was the worst part about this job that bothered me the most .
good,HR is about the company not employees you have to find things out by your self. They will not work around college even if they say education is important it is not.
good,"As with any job you have good people and bad. There isn't anything challenging or exciting to look forward to, Lowes is currently changing and trying to update their systems and culture. Unfortunatly it's beginning to feel like Walmart. Most knowledgable employees are looking to leave due to Lowes removing commission and spiffs."
good,I would go into work not knowing what the day could bring. There were days I would go to the recieving department to start the day looking over the work scheduled to be done making sure the trucks were in the doors ready to be recieved into the building by my team members and I. Then meet my coach and go over the work to be done and where the team members were to be working to start the day and during busy season take and train and place seasonal workers sent to us to help get through the season. I would move trucks in and out as jobs were completed throughout the day and move team members from job to job as well. Sometimes I was in charge of up to 60+ team members. On many occassions I would come into work and be told I would be needed to oversee and take responsibility of a department from scheduling the work to be done to making sure the work was accomplished with my team members. The coaches I have worked with have been very helpful to me and encouraging when the tasks were alot for me to take on without proper training. I feel I was lucky to have had great team members to work with without alot of problems. The hardest part of the job was taking over a department I had never worked in while they searched for a new coach.The coach that I was taking over for had been with this crew for years and was very liked by them. They didn't know me very well and weren't happy about the change so it was a huge challenge to understand the working of the team members and the department at the same time. I have to say it was one of my greatest accomplishments. The best part of the job
good,I would go in and get right to work i was a cashier here. I learned how to ring up all customers as well as take payment. The management was good as well. I got along with everyone and made alot of friends along the way.
good,"Working at Lowe's can be very fun, depending on the store(location) you work at . In my experience most locations had a very light and fun environment."
good,"•a typical day at work start out with punching in at the department desk and cecking for your daily worklist/walknotes made by the department manager.Then you walk the department and check for any abnormalitys u need to fix once this is complete u make sure the department is customer ready.I have learned how to interact well with people and how act in a professional manner.I worked at my current job for the last 5 years and this is the worst management has ever been.The lack of communication and respect is to much to handle. My coworkers are amazing, it really a family environment this is the only thing keeping meeting at this place.The hardest part of my job is feeling like im working for nothing ,every time i apply for a position i dont get they rather bring in people from outside instead of elvating the people u already have.The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers ,it alot of the same people you have been helping for yrs"
good,"My typical day involves making sure all the cashiers are busy, taking extra money out of registers, making sure the parking lot is free of carts and all customers are well taken care of."
good,Would work for company again I enjoyed the experience.
good,"Store specific management has a lot to do with store policies, procedures and employee level of satisfaction.  One store is like a family, the other is dysfunctional at best."
good,"Lowes was a great place to work until the upper management changed, then they cut my pay so I left after 20 years. I would have stayed and retired if it wasn't for that."
good,"A lot of layoffs recently, but they seem to make real attempts to retain people in alternative positions. That being said, being employed here does not give one the feeling that they have real job security."
good,"Can be very stressful. Not much training, basically thrown to the wolves. Management is not held accountable for completing there work.  Most everyone is friendly and easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job is correcting other people’s mistakes that are not held accountable."
good,"Being pro loader I feel like I should be getting paid more due to the fact that I am helping out more in other departments than my own. Also, coworkers have been great."
good,Nice people but it isn't worth the stress or people taking advantage of you. Things are not very organized. Sometimes you are having to struggle alone because there aren't enough people on the schedule.
good,"Management would never take the time to listen for instance we had problems with mice. I would ask management for  help in getting a person in to help with the problem, It never got addressed until a customer had a mouse run up her arm and OSHA became involved."
good,"Hardware store retail is not that fast paced, which is what I was used to. Tons of downtime, but on certain days around 30% will have a lot of stuff to do."
good,"Good place to work if you dont want to make a decent wage. You learn a lot about construction materials and techniques, sometimes people would receive impromptu interviews with contractors."
good,Good place to work. Little bit of good old boy system still going on. But overall a decent place to work. Corporate  is leading it down a road that is not making most employees  happy. So end up losing a lot of good people.
good,"Plan on working most weekends.  They changed things recently by having associates fill out a shift preference form to say whether you want to open, work mid, or close.  However, they changed the shift policy to where you would be on a set rotation with set days off, to now you will usually work your preferred shift but won't have set days off.  Also, you will now only have one weekend off every 8 weeks where before you had one weekend off every 4 weeks."
good,"Micro management at highest level. "
good,Lowe's is a great place to work as long as you keep mainly to yourself. Some days it is extremely busy and the managers are stressed and sometimes tend to snap at you not meaning too.
good,"Lowe's is all about serving the customers, the employees do the best of their ability to ensure customers satisfaction and help in their upcoming projects."
good,enjoyed working for Lowe's. at the time had good people running the company and good management team directing values and expectations on work life balance. not sure what it is like now. but it was a good company to work for.
good,It was a great job nonetheless. Good pay easier work. I was a seasonal employee in my senior year of high school and they seemed to grow frustrated with me calling or scheduling off due to senior things like college visits and ceremonies etc.
good,"Unnecessary for HR to work 48 hours on rotating schedule for the needs of the store."
good,Family like atmosphere.  Company began getting strict. If they don't trust us we shouldn't work there. Let slackers get away with nonsense but firing left and right for stupid stuff.
good,I think that overall the company is slowly moving into the right direction. There is a lot of opportunity to advance up the corporate ladder if that is your goal.
good,Lowes is a good company good pay but at the same time is crazy down there nice people  but like to a different department that's all i have nothing else but i am good to go now
good,"I had a bad experience with my manager they clearly did not like me and made it very evident but other than that, everyone else was very nice and fun to work with. In fact I loved working at Lowe's at least until the new CEO took over my job was easy to balance with my personal life and was actually looking forward to going to work each day until the new CEO changed everything for the worse."
good,Will always be on your feet. They short staff departments in order to save on labor cost at the expense of customer service. Not mush support from upper management.
good,Great open door policy. Fast and friendly work environment. Work responsibilities are very diversified. Management team is a very tight group which makes communication very compatible.
good,A typical day at work was hectic but enjoyable. I knew coming in that customer service was going to be super busy but I knew I could handle it. During the busy times I didn’t worry about the line I made sure every customer I took care of was happy when they left that desk. In between customers I was also having to answer the phone and transfer those customers to the right department. Working this hard was difficult but at the end of the day I was proud of myself!
good,"There were about 3 managers that made everyone talk smack about this place in the break room. I went to upper management to complain and was told I had 3 options"
good,"Every store I have worked in has had a few rude managers. Coworkers are very inconsistent if they are good or not. I have had plenty of great coworkers in my time at lowes, but i have seen lots of issues with the corporate doing things everyone at the store hates."
good,"okay place to work at, the management style needs work but over all my coworkers were wonderful people and friends and I wouldn't have changed a single thing about it either"
good,Working with customers I learned a lot about electronics. Management was good they worked with you. Good place to work. Hardest part people sometimes.
good,"6 am Unload a truck full of pressure treated lumber (1 hr) Forklift work"
good,It's an okay job. Your schedule is all over open mids closing every week. Pay is okay not bad but could be better. Always taking about credit cards...
good,"routed trucks took phone calls, management does not communicate changes within the company untill 3 days before a major change is taken place. Coworkers a friendly"
good,"You will regularly be given five different tasks by one manager and then five more by another 10 minutes later, to be completed in addition to your regular daily duties.  Management has no clue how to work with their associates.  They point fingers and make demands.  They don't understand working with their associates strengths and have poor communication. They play favorites.  It is retail.  You will be dumped on by customers for things you have absolutely no control over.  Too many coworkers in my store are childish-I'm not in high school; I left that place years ago hoping people would be more mature with age.  I thoroughly enjoy what I my job title entails and helping customers, but dealing with the coworkers and disorganization will get to you after a while."
good,Management could be better. Pay is based on experience. Ive noticed a lot of workplace drama and discrimination. But I've meet a lot of kind coworkers.
good,The store has been well taken care of. You will always see a clean work place at Lowes. Great place to work. Mamgers are great. Lot of leaning material.
good,"Management is hard to get along with, they train new people very slowly. Great coworkers but management is frustrating. Only one manager in the bismarck store is considered useful and caring to employees needs"
good,Things have changed competition is always compared to home depot hours are cut when we are short handed it seems to work on a buddy system we lost a lot of good people when big changes came around
good,"Working at Lowe's is challenging but can be rewarding.  While it is impossible to satisfy all the people all the time, it is expected at Lowe's. Managers are often unwilling to commit to a decision which often leaves policy and procedures on the floor in flux."
good,"Managers were possibly the worst part of the job. Coworkers all had a very tight bond. Lots of physical work, accommodations could be better for outside workers during summer months"
good,"Lots of work with heavy lifting. Long hard hours, breaks are not mandatory to be taken. Work canbe stressful at times depending on how large the truck is."
good,"The stores makes well over 120000 a day yet we can not get more hours because they arent making enough money, also they continue to hire new workers at a higher pay then employees that have been there for years"
good,It wasn't the worst but not the best. I would work there again if I had to but not as a cashier. So I could feel more valuable and appreciated with the chance for advancement.
good,Working at Lowes is not bad. The Lowes Life is a real thing. the schedule makes it virtually impossible to have a life outside work. You get burned out in a very short period of time. Management is relentless and does not seem to care. They know they have other applicants to select from.
good,Management and scheduling need to be better. Management needs to take care of their employees more rather than just focusing on the customers; their employees have needs too not just customers.
good,I’m working for SMX which is a temp job and not directly employed by Lowe’s. I have no benefits at all. Lowes is not currently hiring any full time associates.
good,worked in shipping/receiving as an unloader in which there were lots of days you wouldnt actually be working in that department. was tossed into lumber with 0 product knowledge and expected to help customers.
good,Overall great place to work but lacking job security. Management lacks in the ability to provide consistent feedback that will allow you to meet your goals.
good,It is your typical corporate office but with the leadership change there has not been stable job security. Management in the past lacked the ability to provide consistent and meaningful feedback that will allow you to hit your goals.
good,"lowes is a great company to work for, but you have to be in the cliche to advance.it would be better with less drama and managers that actually manage."
good,"Initially, the job is hard. It takes some acclimating, but once you're used to working 12 hours and standing up about 11 of those, it isn't too bad. Fellow coworkers are usually pretty easy to get along with. But management is poor. The supervisors will, most of the time, not treat you with respect, higher management claims they appreciate your work but don't actually prove it. Overall, if management is not hounding you, the job pays well and is a good job."
good,I was so bored if we weren't busy and if we were busy there seemed to be a lack of employees. When I had got hired on they had to let go of the HR person along with all the other stores. It made it even more impersonal after that. Not very much communication going on.
good,"This company is good for second income, or college students.  I don’t feel it’s a career job. Lowe’s has changed a lot and I am not comfortable with where it’s heading"
good,"Store manager is a dishonest, sketchy, inconsiderate person.  The company itself treats you ok and has potential.  Just no accountability or care for employees from management."
good,"The company has been great to me by allowing someone without a college education to promote from within.  I began in an entry level position and was able to promote to a store manager position in a relatively short amount of time. "
good,"I had to clean restrooms, break room and sometimes training office. i have to sweep and mop hallways and clean water fountains. i also have to blow off sidewalks. i also have to run floor scrubber and take recycles.and empty trash. i like working for company but haven't got a full time position yet. management is OK and work culture is not the best to many people call out sick. The hardest part of my job is cleaning men's room and easiest is driving floor scrubber."
good,I was a pricing coordinator for 2 years. The pay was ok and I loved the set hours of 6am-3pm monday thru friday. I hated the management which caused me to seek better options
good,"I'm a pretty humble guy and as my first job, I'd have to say that it was a good experience. Do not expect a set schedule unless it's extremely strict."
good,"Lowes, for me, was a great place to work! It was fun to work with people that wanted to work with you and had the same views as you did. there was a lot of frivolity in the work place as well as comradery."
good,Good place to work. Upper management is ok but the assistant managers or supervisors are all power hungry with chips on there shoulders. Dont get on there bad side or they will make your life miserable.
good,"Lowe's was a great place to work. I met allot of good people. I enjoyed working with the public. I learned allot about home improvements. "
good,"the store manager  i had was a manager  not a Leader! , he made very bad decisions in personnel without developing them, expecting people to be up to speed in weeks"
good,"My experience with lowes is pretty extensive. I've worked with Lowes initially from 2011-currently being employed there. Normally I've found Lowes to care about their employees and provide things like good benefits, employee appreciation events, and incentives like bonuses and opportunities for advancements. I've worked as a weekend team member, I've worked in Home décor, paint, Cabinets and as an Interior Project Specialist. "
good,Was happy at Lowe's while I was there.  I was well compensated but most employees are not....  There is some distress working there at store level due to the pressure....
good,I have enjoyed working for Lowe's for the past 2 years.  With new management at the top end - there are LOTS of changes still to come.  New CEO is making more like Home Depot.
good,Customer service and sales is the focus. Sometimes this does not leave time for physical work and cleaning. Management varies by the zone so it just depends on who you get. Over all for a retail store it is not a bad place to work.
good,"Great company but they have been downsizing a lot, taking away bonuses and eliminating stores and positions, not enough staff to complete tasks safely, much job uncertainty."
good,"not the greatest model for growth with all the politics to play. "
good,"People are pretty easygoing and friendly to work with, but the management needs to communicate better. Things end up getting confused and made harder to do than expected because lack of communication."
good,Loaded and unloaded merchandise on pre-planned delivery routes to customers home.  High level of customer interactions.  Use of truck mounted forklift.  Interaction with warehouse and delivery personnel both internal and external at other store locations
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowe's. Everyday was a challenge to see if you could help someone fix an issue they were having. Most of the co-workers were great. I started to climb the ladder, so to speak. I started out as a specialist and then became a department manager. I took training to move up in the company, but the bench for moving up is long and politics, kissing butt, play a big part. Since I don't play politics I was passed over. The pay was not good for my position. I maxed out at a little over $17 an hour and I was told that was high for a department manager. With the schedule rotation you had 13 weekends off a year."
good,I enjoyed working for Lowe's in Meridian Mississippi but when I tried to move stores to Oklahoma City. I was unfortunately let go because the store I was transferring to was not hiring because the company is cutting hours and that means that people are being let go.
good,"Depending on the manager will depend on work experience weather it will be good or bad, my most recent store manager was cleaning house and played favoritism with anyone she didn’t like she got rid of."
good,Environment is changing.  It's hard to say what the future holds.  Eliminated in-store HR Managers.  Not a good sign.  They don't seem to value what we bring to the table.
good,Good and bad days all fell upon the bosses. Very little accountability for the higher ups. Other than that very nice place too work and gain good long lasting experience.
good,"Home Improvement is a great business that is less vulnerable to on-line competitors,  Lowe's desperately needs to upgrade systems to better serve customers."
good,A company that actually tries to take care of their employees. The hours do differ weekly and sometimes it can be tough to work around especially if you have a family with younger kids.
good,Managers have no experience in managing workers.  The store would perform much better if management would put as much effort in finding ways to keep the best employees instead of planning cookouts.
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for. Its never felt just like a job. Most of the associates feel like family more than anything else. I've learned so much from co-workers and customers alike, to further my knowledge of products and installation of products."
good,"All the parts are there for a fantastic company."
good,Lowe’s home improvement is a good place to work if you are knowledgeable in the department in which you are placed. That is not always the case at Lowe’s.
good,"Management isn't fair to everyone, a lot of favortism going on within the ranks. Associates are nice though, made a lot of good friends with other workers."
good,I liked it here. Was a shift in management that was my undoing.  I went from a manager willing to teach me to one who didn't care. Couldn't shift my schedule around to better run the department I was in
good,I enjoyed working at Low's because of the people and the discounts.I worked in the paint Dept. I learned a lot about color and how to paint and about customer service.
good,Not enough floor coverage to handle customers needs. Managers don't like to help associates with the coverage or take on tasks that would free up Specialists to deal with customers. Misdirected priorities by management at store level
good,"Being a mother of two children, I have needed something full-time since I started. I have yet been able to get a full-time position here after three years of talking to management and HR about it. They typically can work with your schedule or will put you somewhere where they can work with your schedule. It is a friendly environment to work."
good,"Staff was helpful and friendly when I started and training, work schedule varied depending on need, management a little lax on their duties as far as filling in gaps in staffing when an employee called out I as Head Cashier had to get permission to call in someone from my staff that I knew would come in or work earlier or later if I asked it of them however most of the time I was not allowed to do so."
good,Extremely high paced workload. The biggest benefit is working with fantastic individuals. Continual online learning. Job duties continually changing throughout the store.
good,Fast pasted work environment with many moving peaces. You were required to know all aspects of the business especially your departments business. Management is only interested in on hitting the financial goals for the Store and each Department. A typical work day was getting done what was humanly possible by prioritizing what was the most important to the lease important. I enjoyed learning new and exciting things the company had to offer.
good,It's a very good job but it is a set schedule so if it says the job requires nine to five but you have to leave at 4:30 you have to stay till 5 unless you get a manager on-site to let you go
good,not a bad place to work depending on location  management could improve  doesnt matter what you suggest it will not be considered unless you ae a favorite  its like being in a highschool clique
good,"The hours are terrible.  The scheduling is so awful that its literally impossible to do anything with you ""free time"".  Your ""corporate scheduling rotation"" is made up on the fly."
good,"Lowes was a good place to work, not perfect but good. It was a nice experience working there but Management could have used some better training in communication."
good,"I have worked for Lowe's for a year and a few months. A typical day at work for me involves my doing more than I should due to not having the help I need, or getting fussed at by other employees because I am doing my job and other duties through protocol. The culture that I work in is often negative and extremely dramatic. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I have a decent pay and getting to experience customer service in a variety of situations. I have learned that retail is not my area that I should remain in due to the issues within the store individually. I am seeking out something more relative to my degree."
good,"I love Lowe's,  would retire from there if the Work life balance was better. You have the usual manager's that are power happy that micro manange, but, if you can look past that it's an awesome job."
good,This was a seasonal position I was hired for.  Felt like I should of been offered some instruction of what was expected from me from a lead type employee.  Had to use my work experience from working in warehouses to preform my job with Lowes.
good,"Easy job, the only stress you get our of it is what you let get to you. Decent pay, really bad work hours. Open availiblity is a must, so be ready to work mornings, nights, and weekends."
good,It seems that there are more bad days than good.  Fairness is limited for advancement. Opportunities seem to be given to those who are not qualified vs. those that have extensive experience.
good,"good job but no job security good benefits, there is no advancement no more, hard to get ahead in the company good benefits, you will stay busy but full time is not there"
good,Filled the bill when income was needed.  Store manager treat department managers like pawns; no security or loyalty. Just an okay experience. Very little opportunity for pay advancement.
good,working at Lowes is ok the worst thing about it is management they are unorganized the best part about it was learning thing about home improvement that I didn't know and a regular work day is full or chaos about product that have been ordered that haven't came in yet
good,l loved working at Lowes but i was not getting the hours needed to maintain my bills and to take care of my kids at that time. the work environment was great and the management team was helpful but needed to make a change to fulfill my financial obligations.
good,Lowe's was easy going. Management was fair and friendly. The customers ere pleasant. They are willing to work with your schedule but it is hard to move up.
good,Great people to work with.. fast paced makes your days go by quick. Lowes is truly customer focused which In turn requires you to be truly customer focused.. quarterly bonuses are offered if goals are met.
good,"I was thinking to stay for long, but I had a bad manager, and after I left the HR wanted to investigate more abut what happen but I tough why they didn't listen and investigate when I was there?"
good,Changes are not always positive.  There have been many decisions made by those which seem disconnected from the store level.  The stability of the company at best feels unstable.
good,this job works out well for those students in college or working at another job. The hours can not be all that great at times but it was a job. You can be expected to do things that weren't in your job description. overall not a bad place to work.
good,"Fairly a ok place to work , aim for full time not really that beneficial if your only part time. Hours vary , hours will be cut every now and then. Good pay , just bad hours."
good,"Most days are pretty chill. Workplace culture is very diverse. Management did the best they could! Learn a lot about interacting with customers, and restocking the warehouse"
good,"The job is easy to do, head cashier is a management position in that we manage people and develop people in their role as cashier.  The hours are hard to do as they are not set.  You could be closing one night and have to be back in the morning.  One week you get one day off and the next week you get 3 or more days."
good,I enjoyed working for Lowes.  They do have a lot of managers that all tell you different things they want you to do.  The pay was low but they did have decent benefits.
good,"I really enjoy working here mainly because of the employees and the benefits are actually the lowest premiums I've seen in a while.  But the pay is at the minimum,"
good,I love the people and customers i work with.  They supported me during some of the most trying times of my life.  Lowes at one time was an excellent employer to work for.  They have changed and allowed the greed for money to overshadow the needs of the whole.  They are doing away from customer service to evolve to the computer age at the cost of employees and their benefits.  It was time to evolve myself and find something better.
good,Management didn't support their staff and would throw them under the bus. I was constantly being over booked on Deliveries but was told not to have any overtime. Trucks were old and we never had the proper tools to do our job. If a tool was damaged or lost leadership would tell to just made do without.
good,"Good place to work for, but it is a extremely stressful environment. Corporate does not set their managers up for success. Their new staffing model needs some work. Individual store needs should determine staffing"
good,I didn't care for the new Dept. Manager.  She has a very poor attitude and never listened to what other people have to offer. She has lost way to many people to still have her position
good,It wasnt a terrible place to work. Not a bad place for a high school kid. Played ping pong a lot.. and golf.. took naps... drag raced fork trucks.....
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe;s and I think it is a great place for a side job, or one for retirement. If you want to make it a full time job you have to understand it is not stable, and Lowe's as a company is going through some big changes."
good,I left before all of the Corporate changes.  I hear moral is down and they cut the pay rate for a lot of employees.  When I was there is was a good place to work as long as you stayed out of the BS.
good,"They don't care about their employees as much as they claim to. At the end of the day, it will be all about the company. Very concerned about the Executive team at this company."
good,"Managers do their jobs when they feel like it, which affected my overall out look on the company. It is also hard to work as a team, as tgere is hardly ever anyone to turn to for assistance."
good,"Learn basic knowledge of multiple departments, decent pay, poor management, awful hours, and poor staffing.  Always have things tocso, but nights are very slow."
good,A typical work day is fast paced even when everything is running smoothly. More and better trained personal. In most instances sales and the customer satisfaction out way the concerns of the associates.
good,very fun and enjoyable place to work though towards the end they did make some changes to management that i felt as though were not beneficial to the company in moving forward however i look forward to seeing how my lowed family succeeds in there future.
good,"Working in the Installed Sales Office is different from working on the sales floor. "
good,Fun place to work and fast paced most of the time. Mixing paint is great and learned a lot on the job. Discount was nice to have as well. Would recommend as a career if pay was better.
good,"When I first stated with Lowe's there was room for advancement, where from there I became a manager within 3 months of employment. Once Corporate decided to cut manager positions to only a few, the grandfathered managers started showing lack of respect towards the demoted managers. From there it was said that the managers manage the department and no longer the employees and the amount of respect and appreciation for us hard workers was gone. I do not blame the company for these actions but the managers who were now in that role."
good,"Good company to work for. Management communication, at that store, could be better.Every store is different.Training could be improved. I would work for them again."
good,"I enjoyed certain aspects of the job but could not see my self making a career.  I had worked for 5 years at this company while attending college.  I had spoken to the HR rep in the store about promotion to a supervisor position and was told I was not qualified.  Once I graduated and was in the process of leaving the company the same HR rep attempted to recruit me for the job I was told I wasnt qualified for.  "
good,"I love the job. I just had some poor management that didn't care and didn't appreciate the  time and hard work that put in. The  poor was horrible that  they paid management  and to advance through the company, you had to be friends with the higher management."
good,"Lowe's is a place that is more focused on making sales goals than it is on making the customer happy.  If you are not cut throat and don't want to pressure people into taking on Credit Cards, Loyalty cards and Warranties then you should look elsewhere.  Your entire career is based on your conversion rate."
good,Fast paced and demanding.  Work environment is relaxed most of the time.  Management does not always get on board with situations.  Work hours vary and work all weekends and most holidays.
good,Great place to work with tons of fun people and great interactions with customers and fellow employees . management can be a nightmare as they are focused on money in the bank and store ratings
good,"The typical day at Lowe's is one that will never stop moving, if you want to be busy. "
good,Lowes is a retail store so half of your time is spent servicing customers. The other half of your time is spent stocking shelves and putting back items that have been returned or misplaced.
good,Fun and awesome place to work but can't work enough hours to support my family started out with 35 hours a week and then got cut to 13-15 hours a week.
good,Good place to work but absolutely no job security. Does not give a two weeks notice and will fire you on the spot and send you home that very second with no reasoning. Tolerates lazy and disrespectful workers that make everyone's job more difficult.
good,"Tough to balance work and home life.  Always have been lucky with having great managers, and being valued.  Employee perks are nice.  The work / home balance is tough, and is why I am looking to make a change."
good,"Great location, Family Friendly would recommend to family and friends. Lowe's is a great place to work and the people are for the most part all friendly. For me it was just a far drive nothing against the company just my travel time was a bit of a distance from where I live. Overall a good place to work if you don't mind keeping busy and working."
good,"Make pizzas, food. I have never worked here I don't know why it is making me do this.  I do alot of things that have nothing to do with this lowes. honestly."
good,Fun place to work lowes as a company is not bad but need to work on each store management team the  corporate rotation  schedule  sucks company is doing changes a lot of job cuts
good,"It was a decent milestone job that teaches you how to deal with people,Especially management. They require a great deal from the younger employees due to the lack of numbers. If your young, come prepared to work or lose your job."
good,"Lowe's is a very balanced environment with its stressful and busy times as well as its slow paced times. Overall, it depends what store you work at and what your management and associates are like. Recently there has been a big change in the store where they had gotten rid of a lot of people and it has had a negative impact on the company overall. The job is what you make of it and if you have a positive impact and are hard working, i think you could enjoy this job. There are great benefits and the pay is fair."
good,"I have worked for Lowe's for about a year. It is a good company and the employees work hard. Advancement in this company would take a number of years. The management has changed many times, but still not that great. They need to focus on their employees equally as much as they focus on the customers."
good,"for part time employees, flexible hours, some very good and experienced people there. New employees have basic training course to help learn the store, etc. Otherwise, you learn from other employees. a number of opportunities on different departments."
good,I Learned a lot about home improvement and worked with a great team. The training could have been better and management could have been more involved in that training. Most of everything I Learned was from the people that I worked with.
good,"I like my co-workers, but management doesn't handle employee issues.  And the corporate rotation schedule sucks.  There is no straying from it either.  Its set in stone and basically you have to have complete open availability and possible to work  anytime between 6am-11pm. 7 days a week.  Often pulled into departments that are not yours and you have no experience in, so that can be frustrating too."
good,"Love the people I work with, and the benefits are outstanding.  However, new corporate policies and changeovers are changing the way things are done, and it is making working here too stressful with my hands being tied behind my back in too many circumstances."
good,"A typical day at work would be standing at a register, scanning items and taking payments."
good,"Main manager is awesome and is willing to work with employees to make the store better.  However, a couple of  the Assistants are not open to making changes, and would just assume write you up or ignore your ideas than push a change.  But a store that won't change is doomed to close!!  you also only get to call in 5 times in nay 12 month period, and even if you use sick time it still counts twards the 5 days."
good,"Work / Life balance is ok, but could be better"
good,Usually the days are the same and the job should have been easy. But there was always some kind of scheduling conflict and that made the job much harder.
good,"This job was very fast paced, but a stable environment. I would highly recommend working here if you don't mind getting your hands on experience with building material and great customers."
good,I enjoyed most of my employment at Lowes in Butler PA. Staff was great and they helped me come out of my shell and become a more active and social cashier and department worker.
good,"Normal days at work entailed customer service and freight. Management is alright. You learn a lot as you go, occasional training."
good,"I have nothing bad to say about this company, I like the work schedule. It was what I needed at that part of my life. I just needed to make some money while in school."
good,"Job duties include •	Customer service including customer information (ex: name, address, phone number, email, etc.)"
good,Generally I enjoy working there.   I would like to have better work hours.  Some managers do not interact with employees nor do they give us feedback as to how well we are doing.
good,"I really liked working at Lowes, I enjoyed helping people with their projects.  I took great pride in making sure each customer had all the   products they would need to complete their projects."
good,Wonderful company with Safety as its core value.  Management structure very poorly developed with uneducated and unprofessional leaders who strive on intimidation and condescending demeanor.
good,"New employees are often treated better and promoted than people who have worked there longer and have more experience. I learned a lot about customer service working here, especially since I had to deal with a lot of old racist customers. Coworkers always joke about drinking, even in store meetings. Some managers were really unprofessional and unfair to those below them."
good,"Rigid to change, hierarchal slow moving highly matrix organization. "
good,"Senior management really beat you down with negativity and tasking with unrealistic expectations.  However, the pay was great and regular hourly employee were amazing."
good,"Lowe's gives opportunity for growth, and experience in a retail setting."
good,"Lowe's North Brampton is a great place to work, but there is not very much room for advancement. the environment is amazing and the people are friendly but it was not the right career for me."
good,"This is a very fun company to work for. It is definitely a ""by the book"" company. You are able to learn about the departments if you are not stuck in the cashier position. The opportunity for advancement is easy if you put in the hard work and effort; proving yourself to be a great asset."
good,"typical big box store,focus on cust service and sales,,not enough opportunity to advance,dislike the random scheduling, pay is ok but not for the average floor ssociate"
good,a good place to work when your just getting started to the work inviorment you meet a lot of good people while working there and they have good benifits.
good,"Lowe's has great structure and levels of management. "
good,"Its very independent culture no one helps or really cares if your not a direct hire. Management was abysmal. And like I said if your not a direct hire, they could care less."
good,"A normal day at work would include, down stocking, doing resets for the changing seasons, assisting customers, creating a work list for the other associates in the department. as well as train other associates on products and uses."
good,"The company decided to cut the position of department manager meaning a loss in position for 1000s of people. it was not a bad place to work but it has done this twice in 5 years, it feels a little unstable"
good,"As far as retail working experiences go, Lowe's was a very good place to work.  As time, has gone on; they have continued to reduce managements bonus opportunities without increasing the salaries."
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowes overall. I was employed there for over 6 years until I became a stay at home mom when my son was born. My main title was cashier/customer service but I did scan the store for restocking purposes know as IRPs. The few things that I wasn't pleased with included no room for advancement for myself, raises were not great but overall the benefits for insurance at the time were very affordable but I just insured myself. I would reccomend this company overall."
good,"Being in Management, this job is really out of touch with its employees. Constantly changing rules and policies confusing everyone. Tough to function when no one communicates with each other."
good,"A company that in 2003 taught me how to have what I needed to give the best customer  service. A wonderful training program and the best human resource person,  an employee would ever want."
good,Good place to work . People are great like a family. Over all team effort to accomplish goals. Allows you to help customers find the right products for there needs
good,"Great part time job, if you have a 2nd job or if you are in school. unable to support oneself on hours because they are constantly changing and never the same"
good,High energy facility. Very friendly team members. Its a very physically demanding facility. There is room for advancement. If the  team members choose to.
good,"Good, fun place to work, management is terrible, fast pace, self teaching, want cross training but have to teach your self, short handed"
good,"Working for Lowe's was for the most part a pleasant experience. "
good,"It is difficult to advance in this company. However, it is a fast paced company that keeps you on your toes and will keep you busy. There will never be a dull day when working for this company."
good,the management is really good .. they let you know in advance if theirs a problem...i enjoy working with the staff an management...they always focus on there work..
good,"Seasonal employee building materials and lumber. Work there from 3/18/2016  until 8/13/2016 until they let me go in the middle of a shift.  They call me back to the HR office and to told me the season was over and they were letting me go right then. , but told me I was a great employee dependable and to continue to apply at lowes in the future.  I'm 54 years old worked harded than the  younger guys in my department.  I have applied for 45 job opening at various  lowes and still have not gotten one interview yet. Some were part time and some full time.  One more thing 7 day after I eft a part time position opened up at the store I worked at in the same department I worked  and the same job was doing.  I applied but no interview.  I herd many good things about lowes from people who had work there. I did see favoritism there by management when come to hiring part time and full time employee's."
good,"My day consists of multi-tasking along with supervising and managing the front end and registers. I usually am helping out at the customer service desk, or running lunches and breaks for my cashiers. I also must provide manager overrides and do beginning and closing duties along with dealing with money and cash offices. "
good,The company is a solid company with room for growth and learning.  Knowing which direction to go can some times be difficult.  The work life balance can be a struggle.  Very talented people in a lot of the company and very strong work ethic.
good,"In my opinion, the work was good. I enjoyed getting to know each customer i came in to contact with. I learned what it is like to become a small part of some ones life in order to help them make their home life more simple. The management was okay, but not very helpful. The co workers were the ones who really held every thing together. We became a family. The hardest part of working this job were the crazy hours. Besides not knowing for sure when i will be scheduled, it was a nice place to work. I most enjoyed getting to make customers smile or laugh."
good,Fun and Productive work environment .Learned mobile web and app testing a lot following both manual and automation.Co workers were fine and some Employee were little hard to deal with but rest of them were fine.
good,"A great company, life and work balance is not present for an adult with kids. "
good,"I loved helping people find what they were looking for: for projects,home improvement, or just simple Electrical questions."
good,They are very family oriented and even if I find a full time position I would like to stay there because I do like it there. Communication between management and workers needs improvement.
good,"The first year there we set records and the corporate office didn't like when we didn't meet sales of previous year and had a giant lay off that got me as it was a last in first out lay off. So once you are there for a while you are safe, but anything around a year or less and you are always in trouble of losing the job it seems."
good,"So much home improvement trick you can learn and pass on to customers, co-workers were great but the management is a bit lacking in direction. Heavy lifting and just exhausts you after a while. Downstocking is the best part of the day."
good,"I loved my co workers but management was something else. The store manager was an amazing person, but there was a couple zone managers who shouldn't have held that position."
good,"The job is wonderful to work at because all the employees are like family. Even though working outside can be tough knowing that it is getting closer to the summer, the job is not that hard. Drink plenty of fluids and make sure you don't over due yourself when lifting."
good,"Lowe's has a solid business plan and great associates. Lowe's provided me the chance to increase my sales knowledge, meet easy going people, a dynamic work environment as well as increase my persuasive techniques with people from all walks of life. Its given me a chance to break out of my comfort zone to prove to myself that things aren't as bad as the mind tries to make it. However, with these things in mind I do have a suggestion concerning the overall management style of my former ""superiors"". Managers need to staff enough associates for adequate coverage in ALL departments considering quarterly trends and staffing requirements regardless of personal bias and generally irritable attitudes when asked to provide. Lowe's is a taker. Not a giver. This is my main disappointment. "
good,"I loved the staff I worked with, however the management was unapproachable, uncooperative and was never willing to compromise."
good,"loved the people and the management, but not enough hours and the position i wanted was never available till now."
good,It's a good place but I am tired of missing out on my children's lives. The managers are good but none of us actually get to spend much time with our real family.
good,the management needs more training we have to train the new managers for their departments since no one can find the time to train them from main office. advancement is hard no matter how many customer recommends are given no way to get a safe postionn with this company ...
good,"I was hired on as seasonal help. The store work hours are from 6am to 11pm. If I didn't watch the schedule they might place me on from 4pm to 11pm one day, and have me coming in at 6am the next. There wasn't any training from the department supervisor who seemed professional enough, but was always in the office doing other things. My co-workers were great in trying to get to a level where I could handle the department on my own, but just a week or so in I was by myself and unable to properly handle customers and equipment on my own."
good,"Working in the paint department was fun. I enjoyed helping customers with their paint and stain questions. The worst part of work is the repetitive nature of it. Sure, you would help different customers each day, but it was essentially the same everyday."
good,"Friendly, casual work environment. The home improvement knowledge gained will benefit your personnel life. A typical day is never routine."
good,"I get to work and before I clock in, im asked to do things that are not part of my job description and it is not appreciated.  I learned how not to be a micromanager like my superiors"
good,"If you want to get to know some great people than lowes is great. It the people that make the job awesome. Unfortunately if the management is poor the people suffer...  in the beginning Lowes was amazing, but the wrong people got promoted over their abilities... Corruptions and abusive attitudes brought the whole place to its knees."
good,I assist customers needs and handle money on a daily basis. Return product that customers bring back. Keep areas clean and neat. Put back items that belong on the shelf. Take money for customers bills to get paid. I enjoy the scene and people I work with. Everyone is willing to help out one another.
good,"A typical day at work was always filled with customers. There was always something to do or someone to assist, so it was difficult to become bored. "
good,The job was good. You get paid more as a Cashier than an any other Retail company. Great Benefits! You get an hour break on the Front end while floor associates gets an hour break plus as many 15 minute breaks as they want.
good,"Co-workers were nice. They helped me when I needed it. We all would help each other out when we needed it. If you have knowledge about other departments, its good to have because you could help the customers more."
good,Learned a lot about how to run a business as well as sales and management. Enjoyed helping people solve their problems. Fast passed environment helps me to react and make decisions quicker.
good,"It was a good place to work for and I regret leaving and not just transferring. The co-workers were all really good solid folk, most of them were incredibly laid back and care free. Management was all just hired, they claimed to work from the ground up but it was very clear they didnt, and so they never knew how the procedures worked in reality. I think because of this it caused a lot of issues, often times one manager would tell us to do ABC, while 5 min later another would tell us to do XYZ. That kinda killed enthusiasm but we did it none the less and overall I think it was a good experience."
good,Working at Lowes was not terrible.  Great people to work with.  Management for the most part was really involved with everyone and worked well with their employees.  However being a delivery driver was a little rough.  Long hours and heavy appliances made for a hard working environment.  But honestly not a bad place to work.
good,"The experience with Lowe's all depends on where you work and the management team.  I worked at a high-volume store where my work ethic was valued so highly I set my own hours and was never asked to wear a uniform; later, that same store promoted someone to management who became a screaming, goose-stepping control freak.  I worked a a small store where the management team was impressed by my work, then a new store manager from depot fired half the staff to hire his friends from Home Depot.  He heard nothing but good things about me, but I held him in very low esteem nonetheless."
good,"Lowes was a fun seasonal job. A typical workday included helping customers with finding what they needed for the particular project they were doing, doing inventory, driving the forklift and loading merchandise into customers cars."
good,"Management is too afraid of upper management to make any real descisions, leaving the lower employees drowning in the s***. If the policies and management would improve, this would be a great job. It's easy and the pay is very good compared to other retail jobs."
good,"Ring up customers, be kind and help them if needed. bag items correctly handle money, credit cards, checks. Keep a neat clean work space."
good,"We have a lot of employees that work with us, but two managers that run it all. "
good,Assist customers with food and retail purchases. Greet customers entering the establishment. Count money in cash drawers at the beginning and end of shifts.
good,"I worked at 2 locations....14 years in many positions, many upper management changes. New manager, complete Stalinist purge."
good,"I worked in the garden center, so I spent all day and every day outside. I learned so much while I was there. I know how to build/maintain almost everything that is outdoors. I learned about plants, trees, retaining wall, patios, building fire pits, building any type of fencing, the best grass seed/fertilizer and when to lay it, swimming pools, and much, much more. The co-workers are very friendly and most of the management are nice. The hardest part of the job was when I would have to load many 50+ pound bags of products on days where there was little help in the department. It's a great job if you want to get in better shape and get a tan! The worst part about the job is the cold winter months (and I guess the summer months for those who can't handle the heat). Another thing that's not so good: if you are a part time employee, the amount of hours you get may depend on the season and how well the sales are that week."
good,A typical day at lowes would be me running around the store helping my co workers better understand the promotions we have going on or just helping out in the departments. I have learned to become more organized and I've learned time management. I think the hardest part of my job is the inconsistent schedule I have. Its hard to balance everything when I work such crazy hours. On the other hand what I love most about my jobs would be the customers that come in.
good,Interesting place to work and learn very useful skills. Opportunity to advance is rare and you can be moved whenever
good,"I loved working here until we received a new manager who was over the cashiers, he had no idea what he was doing because he came from a different department. He sucked, he was too bossy! I'm not one to complain about management but this was horrible! I had to leave!!!!!! Other than that it was a very simple job and it paid well!"
good,Even thou you're hired for one job you never know what to expect. Everyday you could be asked to do something outside your normal duties. Smile and keep moving get the task done.
good,working with people who at times can be very rude and say some hateful things that
good,I make sure that everything in the department is stocked (no empty holes). I also assist customers in finding products and questions they might have. I clean the department. I assist any other employee's that might need help. The management and fellow employees are very friendly and understanding.
good,"All around good place to work. Employees are helpful and stay busy."
good,"I would not go back too work at lowes. Management isn't trusting,"
good,Poor management and no job growth opportunities.  The pay for the work you put in is horrible.  Wouldn't suggest working for this company
good,Great place to work.  Friendly staff. Everyone is very helpful.  Good training program.  Corporate would visit often and talk to all employees personally.  They care about each location.
good,"had a changing working schedule.co-workers very helpful, was"
good,Helpful managers and friendly coworkers always willing to help.
good,"I enjoy designing for customer, dislike about the job the employees they hire due to lack of knowledge in the specialty departments and  lack of proper time for training. Learned the others systems that Home Depot did not have."
good,"I enjoy the community here but I feel like I have no time outside of work I have been able to request time, off which is a plus but I am having a hard time getting hired in as an actual part time employee. I am currently a temporary employee and have interest in continuing to work here. I have applied for 4 jobs and haven't had a single interview for any of them."
good,"This is a good company for the college student, or as a second job. However, I am trying to start a family and have a house payment and car payment, as well as an associates and would like to learn more from a field closer to my interests that offers full time."
good,I basicly cashier for the first half of my shift then i go to wherever they need help.
good,This job had many different hours to work.  If you were off you were more than likely to get called in.  Co-workers were friendly and so were the customers.
good,"A typical day at work depended on the weather or season spring and summer was the busy seasons, so therefore we were always busy i loved that, but when i rained we were really slow and sometimes got sent home early. Management was not really felxabile with needed days off."
good,They had no regards to the lower level employees as work schedules were determine and change way too frequently.
good,"Ive been delivering appliances for about 3 or so years i very much enjoy it but they take take take and are not willing to do anything in return, there is no management for the delivery department just a receiving manager which through out the years each has never been willing to do his part when it comes to the delivery department..other then that its a fun job i get a good amount of overtime so ive got that going for me."
good,Fast pace. Great work atmosphere. I was cross trained in 8 different departments.
good,I would come in at 4 am and start to stock shelf's from the overnight shipment. Then would make sure the area assigned is clean and ready for customer. Then would help unload and store good from daily shipments to the store. The co-workers were good to work with I would help them and they would in-turn do the same.
good,Lowes had some good people who worked hard and a few who did nothing on the whole I enjoyed working for them.  I would still work for them but had to move to AZ> for my husbamds job.
good,"Working with customers on projects,  putting together orders for delivery, my co workers were fun to work with"
good,I worked in the building supply department and was outside often. Gave me the opportunity to meet many different business people in the area. The main store manager was very difficult to deal with but the rest of the employees were very pleasant.
good,"Worked in administrative and operational management. Completed Senior management training. Senior management left a lot to be desired however, the co-workers were fabulous.The hardest part of my job was training myself and the most enjoyable part was the immediate company."
good,"The company itself is awesome. The only thing in my opinion that is keeping it from being an awesome place to work is the people that they hire as upper management in the stores.  I think they should hire people who are not just qualified on paper but who actually like people.  The company is based on customers who are people and it has people who work in the stores to keep it afloat so why not put people in charge who know how to respect and actually enjoy being around people.  Integrity is just a part of being a descent person so if you put the right people in charge they will automatically improve sales and employee relations. Remember, you can't buy loyalty or integrity but if you put the right people in charge, you won't have to worry about either one."
good,"check emails"
good,"pick up materials, be on the job at the time customer requested, complete job in a timely manner"
good,day at work at Lowes have to find product load it than go delivery it...Learned how to work with alot of differnt people and customers...co workers are the thing i loved working for lowes..hardest part of the job would be searching for product that you need to deliver..part i love about the job is getting to work with co workers and meet new customers every day.
good,"It would be a great place to work if there were set hours and days to work.  The management has job title but no discretion.  There is no accountability for wrong doings.  There are many 'clicks', somtimes you have to walk on eggshells."
good,It wasn't the best place to work I didn't like having to clean the men's restroom when my job description was cashier. Being up front on the registers was the best part since you got to meet all sorts of interesting people that came into the store
good,average could of been better management. I enjoyed teaching people how to clean windows for residential and commercial.
good,Great company to work for but too much high school level drama and too many loop holes to keep people in the company that should not be there
good,"The floor workers are a mix of really knowledgeable and hard workers that are out to help the company succeed and a small percentage of people that are only there for a pay check. The management staff tends to be laid back and lack taking responsibility. Working retail is not a difficult job, but you do have to deal with customers demeaning you on occasion.  The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers, and the feeling you get when you get to help a customer complete their project."
good,"This place is all about who you know and that will determine how far you advance. Advancement is not based on merits but by how many members of management you are friends with. company is a bust for their ""open door policy"" they promote since its very to open to sharing all your secrets. not very understanding with taking time off. you need to let them know a whole month in advance. the pay is very low and not very competitive. "
good,I work in customer service where you really have to multitask and meet customer needs
good,The hardest part of the job was the overflow of product which made it difficult to be consistent.
good,"Depending on whether or not I was on the floor or working a cash register I would be helping customers. I learned their computer systems and how to place special orders. Management put on a good show during interviews, but they really don't do much for the employees. HR never filed complaints properly. Some of the co-workers preferred to gossip than work."
good,Yo yo schedule management lazy like co workers never talk about the good things you do always bad
good,"Lowes as a whole was a great company to work for. But, the managers dont care about their employees at all. The company took away all ""spiffs"" on custom ordering. So that just killed moral, why do the extra work if you are not going to be paid for it?"
good,"A typical day at work can vary depending on who the managers and head cashiers are that day and shift. The weather and season also makes things interesting. Our busy times are in the late spring to early summer and then again around the end of October til Christmas. On snowy and cold days or wet and rainy days, we tend to be slower. However, many times other positions are busier with special orders from customers and details that us cashiers do not do or take care of."
good,"Clock into work and check email for daily work tasks, complete daily work task while providing excellent customer service. Learned a lot about retail sales, inventory counts/cycle counts. Working full time management/ co workers become a second family."
good,After clock in I would report to my work area and greet my co-workers and find out where we were with our work load and make a plan to finish what we had to and work on other areas needing attention. Closer to the end of my shift I would try to pick things up to pass on a clean work area to the next shift.
good,"I was forklift certified. Learned alot about live plants and how to keep them alive.The hardest part of working for this company is the fact ,that job security was nonexsistant"
good,"Management is not stable changes to often. Every time new store rules and policies, on top of ever changing company rules and policies. Hard work doesn't pay here work hard and when you get noticed the management changes.have to prove it all over again while people who don't do any work get promotions. As a company if you can politic well is a great company."
good,Lowes would be a great place to work if they recognized the strength of there employees. They put more stock into hiring from outside the company than promoting from within.
good,i was very happy i work there the chefs are very nice and i learn alot of deffirents things.
good,"As head cashier, I was responsible for the scheduling and supervision of cashiers and front end operations."
good,I gained a large amount of experience dealing with customers and having to multi-task on a daily basis.
good,Overall it was a good place to work as a job while going to school.
good,"I really enjoyed working there, but management would not let me move up within the company no matter how hard I tried. I wanted to move to the floor or do something different, but they liked me where I was because they said I was the best they have ever had in customer service."
good,Lowe's is a job that you can better you skills of customer service.
good,"Lowe's offers so much to their customers that they come back as loyal customers, which establishes a genuine relationship. The energy flows so well with the people you work with it makes everything more productive and always creative ideas to improve."
good,You are able to change your schedule with other employees. You are able to work in different departments.
good,"Lowe's overall is a good company. Though when you become a senior manager you are at the discretion of the company. They can and will relocate you if they see fit, and if you want to continue a career with them you cannot refuse."
good,I meet good people and get to share my expertise. I also deal with vendors and associates and the public. I get to share my knowledge and my projects and learn about other people's projects.
good,"As most retailers do, Lowe's uses the minimum number of people possible to staff each department. Customer service associates also do stocking, cleaning, loading, etc. and are expected to assist in neighboring departments when needed. All departments are fairly physical, some more than others, requiring ability to lift and use various power equipment, stand all day and do lots of walking. Be prepared to take control of your own training, using online resources and figuring things out for yourself if you aren't already knowledgeable in your area. There is a program to shadow new employees with experienced people, but staff is spread so thin, it may not be as thorough as it could be. "
good,Its a great place to work if one is looking for a start or during a break from a permanent full-time position. Especially useful for new Immigrants. Main drawback is the pay
good,You receive so highly valued knowledge applied in your daily work and personal life. The staff is always friendly and will always listen to your needs because they care.
good,Since I'm a part time employee my hours seem to get cut quicker than if I worked full time. It's hard to know what your paycheck will be. Would like to have steadier job hours.
good,"Working with some great people however , late hours at night is terrible , weekends has been taken away and no set schedules anymore has ran off a lot of experience people in the company"
good,"During winter months hours are reduced for cashiers "
good,It's a good job but I just don't see a long term job for myself it does include a lot of heavy lifting and does require some overtime and you will need to be able to drive on some very small roads
good,"the people are great, but the sallary is meant for a high school student or someone living with their parents. the only reason i am still here is because of the other staff"
good,I made up by experience so I ended with $13.80. The managers were okay. Always busy but helped when they could a lot. Getting a hold of departments was always the hard part but as a cashier we could only do so much.
good,As a cashier you are limited in respect to assisting customers (10' register range). You are standing on your feet 9 to 10 hours on concrete for the most part.  Unless you want to be a head cashier and/or have an in you are pretty much stuck as a cashier.
good,It’s a good work environment a lil gossip here and there but I would just stay to myself. Store manager is not a person to go to for advice on how to do this
good,enjoyed my time at lowes. company is in  restructuring phase that I did not want to be a part of. not many postions have good hours 90% chance you will be workig at 5am or finishing at 11pm
good,The work is easy. The people are friendly easy to work with. management don't care about their as much as they should. Depending on the time of the year it's a very slow work day.
good,"Great job; but, the benchmarks to make bonus are so high that most leave for higher paying jobs.  Low starting wages, but lots of opportunities for growth."
good,"I would say that in general I enjoyed working at Lowe's. I was fortunate enough to work with some great people and advanced quickly from seasonal to full-time. It was at times very stressful but overall it was an experience I would repeat. If given the opportunity, I would work there again."
good,Nice place to work. Difficult to advance and your experience can vary by department. But for the most part it's a nice place to work with a laid back but productive approach to work.
good,"It was a mediocre place to work, nothing to exciting, but dont expect a lot of opportunities to advance. I thought the management could've been nicer. But the coworkers make up for it."
good,I have loved working here but they hired me in part time and during the interview she said I would be scheduled 35-38 hours per week.   I have been scheduled that until now.  They didnt disclose that with winter approaching hours would be cut back.
good,"If you are good helping others, have patience and are willing to work hard this position is for you.  Most People that work at Lowe's are very friendly and dedicated to their jobs."
good,"Training was fast and easy and paid, Lowes was a good place to worked but has no advancement opportunities,good people to work with. i enjoyed the people there but there was nowhere to grow ."
good,"The part time benefits are not great. The medical part is a preventative plan and it does not cover pre existing conditions, specialist, surgeries. It on covers four visits per a year. The dental and vision are okay but not great."
good,"Work hours range from five in the morning to midnight and work schedules vary from day to day. Per recent policy change there will be no back to back days off and only one weekend off every two months. "
good,"The hours are horrible"
good,"Lowes is a good place to start your work experience, there are plenty of opportunities to learn many job experiences. For example learning how to cut wood, mix paint, cashiering, stocking, most importantly for any retail store Customer service. Management can be hit or miss, but easily obtainable if that is your goal."
good,"Changes in the business structure severely affects morale and, in turn reduced customer services.  More emphasis on being customercentric needs to occur."
good,"Lowes is a typical retail job so approaching it with any other mindset will result in dissatisfaction. With that being said the pay, work environment, and purpose is better than any other retail job I have worked. I get a sense of purpose working for Lowes, knowing I can help people love where they live. I get payed better than I would in a similar position at lets say Walmart or Best Buy (only slightly). The work environment is also more enjoyable and less stressful at times. Overall I enjoy working for Lowes, but think they could do a better job retaining the most knowledgeable individuals."
good,I started working for lowes back in 2015 and i absolutely loved working there. Iv been fulltime in the hardware and tool deparetment the whole time. Iv learned many things over the past 5 years from my department to paint and register and many more. BUT within the past year lowes is trasforming into home depot. Not necessarily a bad thing but if i wanted to work for a home depot iwould.
good,"it was an ok work environment, and the managers were nice, cool, understanding, and great pay, benefits, alot of learning safety for machines, being nice to customers even rude ones"
good,"great place and good work but bad management"
good,Good place to work for while attending college. There wasn't a good opportunity for advancement that would be beneficial for pay raises that were high.
good,"I worked several departments in the store as well in delivery. "
good,"The best part of working for Lowes was the amazing insurance benefits. "
good,The coworkers were the best part of the job. Managers are always gonna be there for you if you need any assistance or help with anything. Work hard will pay off with Lowes if you show you’re effort and abilities.
good,"Overall I would recommend working for Lowes. "
good,"hired as seasonal part-time, no benefits were available except employee discount.  as a waterer in outside garden there was limited contact with customers.  as time allowed work such as spotting ( for the forklift ), stocking, and display enhancement filled in the day."
good,"I was hired as seasonal employment and within days management was asking if I would want to continue on with the company after seasonal was over. I was led to believe a full time job would be mine but just had to go through the formal interviewing process, but then did not get the position. I have no idea how much longer I will have the job I'm doing now M-F 9pm-5am and no definitive answers from management about other possibilities in house. Very frustrating."
good,Good place to work for helping customer's. Didn't approve of management there. When you need them they took forever to get there and help you. Overriding for cashiers and helping them understand the register.
good,"Seasonal employees worked as hard as part time and received no benefits."
good,"I was an HR Manager and we were required to work too many hours and did not have time for our families.  At the time I worked there, Lowe's wanted your whole life."
good,"Typical day involves me printing a daily report and then working from that report to process daily price changes. As well as auditing and dealing with the weekly signage. "
good,I enjoyed most of my 22 years with Lowe's. The last 12 were by far the best. It's stable work environment if you work hard and apply yourself. Pay scale for hourly personnel is at or just below average for retail work.
good,Lowes is an average retail job. If you have experience in the field you know what your in for. The people I worked with were good and I enjoyed my time there.
good,Assisting customers with purchases and questions about products.  I enjoy assisting the customers with their projects and learning new things and about new products.
good,"I liked working there. I bid a day team job and was given the position but was asked to stay in the paint dept . That was o k with me i liked paint and i was good at it. Two or three months later i started being put on opens ,closes and weekends.That is when i went to sherwin williams."
good,"There's a lot of temporary and turn over associates here.  I got hired in and after a month all of my support left.  Kinda got washed around.  The coworkers were nice and the customers sucked.  I didn't hate it, but meh."
good,Lowes was a great job just didn’t want to work with my schedule I’m still working there now hoping to find another job soon. The pay isn’t too great but the people there were wonderful.
good,"To much emphasis on customer surveys."
good,"This is the first company I've worked at that not only allows, but encourages haggling, creating an expectation that the customer always gets a discount. This wouldn't be so bad if that didn't mean that the store doesn't make its sales goal daily, and hours for the non-salaried workers are cut or extremely limited, causing department shortages and therefore, angry customers who survey and lower our store rank. "
good,"Company has great in-service programs geared to individuals pace of learning/training as well as their goal orientation. The company offers many incentives  and benefits to the employees such as stocks, healthcare, wellness and paid/sick/vacation days."
good,I loved my job until I saw that I was there for 5 years and was not getting opportunities to move up in the company so I had to start looking for other places to work stay very positive in the work place I’m of age and I feel like people don’t take me serious although I’m very serious about my work
good,it was definitely a job not a career. would recommend to a young person not someone who has a ton of expenses due to them not paying well also expect to do other peoples jobs.
good,"Night Stock workers at Lowe's are over worked, not to mention locked inside the building all night so no going out for lunch or if you smoke a cigarette."
good,The job has its perks but for seasonal and part time it’s not many of them: pay should be higher for outside associates because of the heat and labor but besides that everything else is fair.
good,"Despite being a valuable and hard-working employee, I was lost in the shuffle of management and all promise of promotion was last as well. Underpaid and underappreciated."
good,"I love working for this company . It may not be for everyone but for those looking to pad up their income for the summer."
good,Job is good pay and ok hours. There is no set schedules. Hours pick up during spring and summer. Slow down during winter. They have quarter bonuses and yearly raises.
good,Company started great until they started hiring from hiring managers from outside the company.  Outside managers had no clue what was going on inside the store listening to store managers and not their own employees.
good,"For a retail job, the pay is decent and the scheduling is fair.  The hardest part about working at Lowe's is the customer service environment because the customers are typically used to getting their own way and will treat you poorly in order to do so."
good,"Good company, poor manager skills regarding write ups for  things beyond cashier's control  such as a quota on extended warranties when most all of the customers you check out are purchasing plants. First write up ever in my work experience for failing to preform."
good,If you are accustomed to retail a 70 hour work week will seem normal as that is what the expectation is with Lowes district level staff. Minimal travel but that is mainly due to the specific area i am in. The culture with Lowes has always been strong and has been increased lately with new upper management. Long standing employees do not get compensated as well as new.
good,A good place to work if the proper management is present. not many opportunities to advance. Something there for all types of people. Some management could use improvement.
good,"When I first started everything seemed fine. I was taught basic things I should know until I had to start figuring stuff out by myself because it felt like management was never there to help. I started off up front until they started putting me at a lumber register at night with no security. Many employees were college students and were childish (I’m a college student also) but I didn’t find things they were saying to me funny. I always brushed it off though ALWAYS. now I feel that my experience with Lowes has made me not want to cashier anymore because of the mangement, super rude customers & rude employees."
good,Very easy to learn all the ins and outs of customer service. Very helpful in teaching. Good training. Not bad hours and very reasonable vaction and sick time.
good,"This was my first real job in retail or an actual store. Was very calm and easy going for the most part even during spring when the real sales for garden supplies would begin. Associates were very friendly in this area. Day would usually consist of watering the plants in the morning when I would clock in. Afterwards would just be customer service until I clocked out. Closing shifts very similar except for having to clean and use a blower to remove excess dirt, dust or leaves from the garden section. "
good,"Good workplace culture and learning environment for college students. Can be quick paced and stressful, good temporary job. Very flexible with hours depending on management."
good,"Working for Lowe's for the passed 13 years, I can say every company has its highs and lows. Some good days, and some bad. You will definitely learn about everything that is home improvement. I can build a whole house. You will meet good managers and the worst. The coverage on the floor has been lacking as the years go by. You will do more than what your job positions describes guaranteed. The schedule is on a rotation, making it hard to find time to manage with your loved ones. (it's retail) Good pay, great benefits medical, 401k etc.  Vacation hours, sick, maternity leave, stock etc.  You will meet great people and bad, even long time friendships. And helping customers through your career you will meet the kindest to the meanest. Overall its not a bad company to work for."
good,Everyday your never knew what your task was going to be. Weather it was unloading freight. Covering for a certain department. Going on deliveries and installing appliances.
good,"It is a great working environment. "
good,typical day was was helping customers out with what they needed. stocking lumber closing the day.And getting the day ready for the opening person.make sure that everything was in place (Stocked) so the opening crew was satisfied upon arrival. Over all it was good
good,"I enjoy my job at Lowe's, however, with the arrival of the new CEO there have been changes that I do not appreciate.  I do not see a future with this company."
good,"It's an ok place to work, to many hours, the ASM are underpaid for the amount of stress they have to deal with everyday. The part time staff has nothing to loose, so they will do the bare bones minimum to keep there job, the call out's are out of control."
good,Lowes is a fun workplace with potential learning environment. I enjoyed working at Lowes and would recommend Lowes to potential applicants. management at local facility was not as understanding although the employees and customers made it fun.
good,"New CEO is trying to overtake competitor and changing work vision and goals"
good,"My Typical week at Lowe's is not too special. I'm usually scheduled for 4-6 days a week, seeing as I'm part time. The days are usually 7-9 hours with an hour lunch at some point in my shift. "
good,You can gain a great deal of experience to prepare you for greater opportunities if you apply yourself. Advancement is hard unless you have friends and they like you.
good,"Not a bad place for a part time job. Usually always hiring, however in the summer and fall they are often understaffed. That means as a part timer your hours can increase from around 24 a week to around 38-40."
good,competitive pay. flexible hours. quarterly bonuses. great opportunities for moving to different areas around the store. training when on the sales floor is minimal.
good,A typical day for me can mean a lot of different things. I find myself filling in many different positions. I have learned many different things that will help me grow and continue down my career path.
good,It was good while it lasted. Great earning potential with the commission on sales. To bad the company could not support the PSI position any longer.will miss my job.
good,"They made a lot of changed in my time of changing where I worked. I'm not sure what direction of the company's is currently taking. They started paying the new people on a better pay rate, but didnt compensate the employees that were already there."
good,"Typical day at work is usually follow up with client orders and product lead times, calling clients to close deals. Department maintenance and product downstocking is key to maintain product flow. You have 2 15 minute breaks and 1 hr lunch break which is to be taken at or before 5 hrs of your shift start. Often times this is not possible due to shortage of employees and the high demand in customer service and foot traffic."
good,"I would say that in my time as a CSA at Lowe's, I have grown to appreciate the wide variety of skilled laborers and technicians that work as specialists in our departments. I will, however, say that the way position changes are handled (at least in my case) is completely abysmal. There is barely any way to communicate with the upper management about anything regarding a job title change, and with the 7 or so applications for different positions I have submitted, I have only been interviewed for maybe 2 of them."
good,"I really did enjoy my time at Lowe's. I enjoyed the equipment I got to use, I enjoyed the people I got to work with, it was a really great experience for me."
good,"A typical day at work can be slow, but it's easy to find small things to do. Have to have good customer service skills because customers are picky about product. The hardest part is miscommunication between staff."
good,"nice people to work with, some cared some didn't, management was not one of them that cared and it showed. helped customer always tried to keep a smile on my face even when I was being yelled at by management."
good,"Pretty good place to work. The management varies by individual basis and also by location, where I was I had some decent managers. The job can get very stressful, but it makes the day go by fast. The culture there is very much geared towards safety and inclusion. Meetings happen daily, weekly, monthly, and biannually. So there's lots of chances for feedback to and from managers. Structure changes recently have shaken things up, but on the whole a great company to work for."
good,"My only issue with Lowes is that I have not had opportunities to advance even when well qualified due to favoritism.  That is my only issue, but we have a new Store Manager now.  Need more income."
good,The coworkers are great. If you get the right department head you're job can be fun and you feel valued. Black Friday and holidays can be busy but fun.
good,"Great company to work for, loved my job as sales specialist. Exceeded my sales goals monthly. I also made top 25 sales specialist 10 times in Boston region out of 1,200 specialists. The only negative was the scheduling, one day 6-3pm, next 10-7pm, next 2 days 2-11pm."
good,I enjoyed working for Lowe's. The company gives employees the opportunity to move up. I learned the companies computer system and how to navigate through it smoothly. I enjoyed helping customers and taking care of any issues they may have.
good,You get what you expect which isnt all good. Isnt all bad. It is what it is. Plenty of time getting ready for someone thats supposed to come by and never does. No overtime.Heavy pressuer. Good benefits. Take the good with the bad.
good,Its bin awhile since I worked there. It was relaxed and not hard work. Biggest thing is you have to deal with the public. That can be stressful at times. Good place to work for collage job.
good,"At Lowe's you had the chance to get to know many different things and products. Every one was cross trained to deal with all departments. I moved quickly through promotion's, but you have to work for them."
good,"During Season (spring) worked hard and played hard, I learned a lot in the garden center with the help of fellow employees and managers.  I am a self motivator so I went to work jumped in and did my job.   Love helping the customers.   Some days could be frustrating when some of the help would disappear when needed the most."
good,Good job for the most part. Managers wasn’t always aware of the problems at hand. Good benefits through the company. I really met some nice people my time with the company.
good,"Work at Lowes is interesting and meaningful depending on the department you are placed in.  Some departments have more tasks to do which keep you busy or not.  If you are experienced in a certain are you may be placed in an department that aligns with your knowledge, but is not necessarily."
good,"As long as your management team is good. Lowes has great benefits for part time and full time associates. I currently work at a store that isn't up to the lowes standards, but I feel like our new store manager has that under control."
good,Early morning starts began at 4:00AM. Unloading all freight from tractor trailers. Position and put product into inventory and on the floor as needed and required.
good,If you plan on staying a long time and have the patience to wait for them to stop playing with their business model.  Promotions are very competitive also.
good,I am part-time and company is constantly realigning hours. I am having to look for a second job because I'm not getting enough hours and part time benefits are not very good.
good,"The employees made the job fun but other than that it wasn't the best. The management seemed like they didn't know what was going on, it was short staffed most of the time, and the pay wasn't the best either. They also really hated it when you requested time off. When they ask you when you can work it's a joke because they will schedule you anyways and they will change your schedule halfway through the week or the day before."
good,Management sucked back then but they were trying to get the union in at that time they should be able to get paid more to compete with home depot because it is a good company
good,"Its retail, there is possibility to grow in the company. Many managers started at the bottom and grew with the company. Hours are variable but they are more then willing to work around a students schedule."
good,"Lowe's is an excellent place to work, as long as you don't care what kind of wage you make, don't have restricted hours and are willing to break your back on a daily basis."
good,It's a great place to work as long as you find the right store for you. Not all stores are the same - management makes huge difference. But the company in general is a fabulous company to work for.
good,"Quick paced, hard work for decent pay. Not very flexible with scheduling. Management was knowledgeable and good to work with. Vey strict on attendance."
good,Benefits are EXPENSIVE. Overall a good place to work. Management is poor at times and limited advancement is available. All jobs are paid the same except maintenance or management. Best part is the 4 day work weeks.
good,lowe's it was a good place to work because learned things about home improvement and the ends and outs building everything that has to do with wood. also how to lay carpet teach you about lighting
good,"Very busy on any given day. The daily influx of customers does keep you busy. Management and coworker are friendly. I am only seasonal full-time. If you need a job, put in an application."
good,"It’s a good place to work for someone coming out of high school and or going to college. good place for a first, second or third job. The discount is good"
good,"Lowes recently underwent structural changes and it was very poorly executed. Management needs to be reconsidered, starting from the top. The store I worked at lost many wonderful employees, who were replaced by lower paid, less ambitious employees. Morale was always nil and expectations were always rising. "
good,"As with any retail store, the hours are VERY difficult.   If you work well out side of a 8 to 5 schedule, holidays and weekends than this will appeal to you."
good,"i was a temporary employee. the job wasn't hard at all but the biggest issue was the lack of training they had. they expecting you to know the whole department within the first week, or just constantly rely on your phone whenever in doubt but too many times the phone was inaccuracy wasted both my time and the customers. the management was pretty cool, the main part of my job was loading so thankfully i didn't have to spend much time dealing with customers or trying to remember where things were. i personally feel they didn't pay too well when it came to management due to personal reasons but other than that it's big corp. what do you expect?"
good,"Employees in any department are epected to be the best at the job and go the extra mile  but they dont pay very well, starting pay is about $11 an hr."
good,"Management and pay need to be better. If we all work as a team, a variety of things can be done. Appreciate your hard working associates and support them so that they can continue to work hard and not be burnt out."
good,"I have loved working at Lowe's. Lowe's has been amazing for me and my family. There are plenty of opportunities within the company,  but an overall great place to work."
good,The people you work with are great. To move ahead is hard. You either need to be attractive or hang out with upper management. the Rises are alright but could be better.
good,I would go in to work and find out from the lead cashier if I was going to be on the cash register or at customer service. I learned about the cash registers and answered phones to help customers with questions about orders or their accounts. The management was good there. The hardest part of the job was the hours. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"Great place to work. Management is the problem. No accountability for senior management. A lot of excuses made instead of coaching,and building. Inspite of that a good place to work."
good,"This place offers a lot of benefits and there is plenty of room for advancement but there is a lot of favoritism in this company and very hard to promote,"
good,It's a great company to work for; being said; it's said to be a family environment to work; however my experience was not so; some supervisor not so..
good,The management was awesome.  The job was pretty easy but they want you to work full time hours almost with no benefits.  The pay isn't that great.  It was overall a good job for someone who is working while going to school.
good,the company is all about the team and customer satisfaction the sales are heavy on the weekends this position did not involve or get paid for sales at this time.
good,Lowes isn't too bad to work for as far as retail goes. They hire managers from elsewhere as opposed to within. The benefit like insurance are pretty good too
good,"With the right management it is not a bad place to work, but when management drives emloyees out the door leaving every department short staffed it can get obverwhelming"
good,"They overwork you a lot and if you are in a schedule that needs a lot of working hours, lowes i the place to go. You work and get two days off a week, salary is ok."
good,"Understaffed and lack of leadership to gain needed employees during peak seasons   Due to no help, I was the customer go to person, inventory manager, loading attendant, waterwer, cashier etc"
good,"work is stressful but what job isn't "
good,"A typical day at work consisted mainly of helping customers locate products, and helping customers load heavy products into their vehicles. I learned how to operate in a retail environment. The management was well executed and provided a safe, calm workplace culture."
good,"New hires generally assigned to departments utilizing applicants best use of experience.  Varying shift days/hours result in negative work-life balance in personal family life.  Best part of job is exposure to Customer Service where, within limits, had authority to make sensible customer relation decisions."
good,"good job, nice workplace, steady pace. managers are good, but lack communication. I learned many things in a year, and its hard to progress, but very quick to learn."
good,"Working in management at Lowe's is not for the faint of heart. It takes a lot of hours and a thick skin to handle irate customers on a daily basis. However, hourly associates enjoy their work very much and those are the positions that I would recommend to others."
good,"Loved working at lowes it was my favorite place to work, coworkers where friendly and managment was ok, I loved that they worked around my schedule when I needed them to"
good,As in any Job their were Pros and Cons. However over I enjoyed the fast moving work pace. I also enjoyed the variety of work I did on a daily basis. I found it fulfilling and fun. Not an easy job though.
good,worked where for a set period of time with the potential for it to become full time (glad it did not) it is great for a fill in job if you're between jobs like i was at the time.
good,"Typical day at work is coming in and organizing, cleaning and making the receiving area ready for the day. loads come in randomly unless the company calls ahead of time. The skills i have learned to use heavy power equipment, time management and have learned to communicate as a team. Management can be hard to work with because sometimes there is no communication between management and employees making it harder for employees who are already putting in hard work giving them double the work for a pay that doesn't match the work. The work culture here is not that bad once you get threw the first couple weeks and once you get to know people it becomes easier."
good,"I worked at Lowe's for several years. In that time I bettered my time  management skills by setting up itineraries for  meeting with customers and coordinating coverage with my neighboring departments. My coworkers made the job worth coming in to. Some of the best people can be found working at Lowe's! I improved my phone etiquette by calling customers and speaking to vendors. I learned a tremendous amount about the products that we offer and can order. I got to help customers with unique concerns by suggesting solutions that I had learned about."
good,"I enjoy working for LOWE'S. I would like to work closer to home."
good,"I love my job, just looking for a career now. I learn a lot for as multi tasking & coming out of my confront zone. My coworkers are very nice & helpful. The managers are even looking out for you."
good,"I've worked with understanding and kind staff and the environment can be so laid back you forget it's a place of business. However, when it gets busy and when the corporate aspect kicks in, it takes you by surprise. If you have mental health issues that aren't managed (anxiety and depression), I wouldn't recommend this job. If you're a college kid that wants a job with very little work, don't look to this job. This job will work you. You may have a cashier job but your work can extend to janitorial work (cleaning bathrooms and dusting most importantly), carts, and even a few office skills (internet sales and credit card applications)"
good,"Typical day at work is just running a cash register all day and cashing out customers, learned a few things about home improvement items from just talking to customers."
good,I am working at Lowe’s just until I graduate in August 2018. I’m thankful for Lowe’s for giving me my first job and also for working with me and my schedule
good,Lowes has great policies and benefits. The management teams at the stores in my area are poor and suck ups. Hours aren't flexible for most positions. Employees aren't treated fairly.
good,"I used to love working at lowe's but they dont hit the mark anymore with an extremely high turnover rate, it is easy to see why. Would make a decent temporary job"
good,Lowe's CPO is a very interesting place to work. It has much growth in the past year. Many opportunity's but a great place to work. Some management issues.
good,"It's not a bad place to work. The management is pretty laid back, of course they are obsessed with the metrics that corporate pushes, but other than that they are not that bad. The other employees are pretty cool as well, probably the best part of working there actually."
good,"Great place to work for, amazing benefits. Mostly everyone is nice to work with. Wouldn’t recommend to get caught up with other people’s out of work life"
good,Management was good and employees were great to work with. I really enjoyed working with employees and customers. I was a loader and enjoyed it because it kept me in shape.
good,"I enjoy this job because of the people I work with, it is simple and not all that stressful. However, there is really not room for advancement and I am looking for for something more in my life."
good,"a typical day in home decor would consist of me placing orders for customers, and maintenance of the aisle (restocking and cleaning). sometimes i would help out in the paint department as well."
good,I only worked here as a secondary employment in the evenings to make extra income. I enjoyed my position there while I was employed. I would recommend this employer.
good,"This is a fast paced job alot to do stocking, helping customer's, merchandising, pricing, cleaning, inventory, filling shelves from overstock. Good place to work, terrible work life blance, very few positions with set schedules. Only having 1 weekend off a month is ridiclious and the computer systems are dinosaur aged. Seems like a fortune 50 company would have better systems and work life balance."
good,A typical work day is 9 hours. For about the first two weeks your feet are going to be really sore but they start to adapt afterwards. I highly recommend that you invest in good quality shoes. Do your job and management will love you.
good,Not recommended if you need flexible hours or have a family emergency.  Must be willing to walk long distances and stay on your feet for the whole shift.
good,Lowes is an easy going work environment but very little training other then on the computer. The managers rarely teach you anything new unless you ask for help.
good,Lowes has a great deal to offer to their employees and seemingly is a great company but this particular store had very low morale and poor human resource department so it was not a pleasant working environment.
good,"Management was not able  to manage the work load in delivery in order to support the delivery drivers. In the year that I was there, the 2 delivery managers were let go."
good,I had no chance at getting full time with the company. I need a job with full time to support my family. The company itself is great to work for. I just had no advancement opportunities.
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work. Providing job security, competitive  wages and benefits. With opportunities to learn many different warehous/Dc tasks and skills. Along with a friendly fast paced work environment."
good,Good culture with good group of co-workers.  Typical mix of customer service and re-stocking. Main problem is that is very difficult to transition from part-time to full time.
good,"Worked from 7 pm - 6 am, Monday - Thursday with the weekends off. A good balance between work and life style. Not mentally challenging because the majority part of the work includes  taking compressed air and blowing off the conveyors."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowe's, but the pay system restricts management from compensating employees fairly. In addition, the Human Resources personnel do not appear to understand the position beyond what the ""computer"" tells them. When asked about benefits, 401K, or other such topics, the standard answer at the location where I was employed was, ""Its on the website."""
good,"The pay changes every year for new people. Hours are steady, untill seasonal change. 20-37 for seasons. 40+ for after. Depends of if we had 2 trucks or someone called out. People I worked with vary. You have hard workers and slackers. My night manager was awesome. I don't recommend starting off as a seasonal. Look for full time."
good,"Great pay, but terrible work life balance. Your schedule is posted  2 weeks in advance but with the inconsistencies of the shifts you have its hard to get used to one shift."
good,"there are good and bad everywhere, so be careful who you trust. the best ones are leaving to go to better managers. the bad ones stay and move up. work, go home"
good,Its very hard work u got give your all you would have good and bad day but you would just have to push it through you will get a lot if opportunities.
good,All in all a good place to work. I enjoyed my time with them. It was going very well until they started cutting hours unexpectedly. They had no explanation. This is my soul reason for leaving.
good,"A good place to work and can be stressful on fast days, but is relaxed on slow days. The people help out with teaching how to do a job and where to stock stuff."
good,I enjoyed working here. I made a lot of new relationships and was able to strengthen my skills in the sales department.  I also learned a good bit on home improvements and materials for many indoor/outdoor projects.
good,"At the particular location which I worked, we were always very short staffed. This put heavy work loads on our department to which work was always left to be finished. Management seemed to hire more people who felt Lowes was just a job and not take pride in there work. This made the environment very difficult to provide great service to the customer. I thoroughly enjoyed the people I worked with. The company seems more driven by day to day homeowners than contractors."
good,"A typical day was not that day some days would hectic and some days would be slow."
good,Good company to work for but if someone in Management doesn’t like you they will terminate you.  Was there for almost 6 years only had 1 warning about my attendance then was terminated 4 months later. I had been ill a lot this year and also had vehicle problems. For 5 of those 6 years I never had problems with my attendance.
good,Overall Lowe's is a good company to work for the compensation is good they have excellent benefit. My only issue was with the management at my particular store.
good,"Assist customers with purchases in tools and hardware. I learned a lot about tools and hardware. Management people were nice, management policies were harsh. Employees were fun to work with. Hardest part was schedule. Helping customers was the best part."
good,I enjoy working with several of the associates as well as my workplace being close to my home.  My position is new with this company and it poses lots of issues and stress.  I often times must figure out issues and problems without any help from management and others in my store since it is such a new program.
good,"I used to think it was a good career venue, but I'm not so sure anymore. Opportunities are getting fewer and fewer. I still like it most of the time and would still like to continue to work here, but some changes need to be made."
good,"Good and stable company, good friendship among the employees, but the managers are not very professional and most of them are not properly trained to manage employees and store profitability."
good,I operated the cash register. I handled complaints as well. I helped people find things that they were looking for. Cleaned up work station and front end at night when closing
good,"Was the department manager and was very busy with training employees ,receiving and shipping of freight.and organizing receiving area so department could run more efficiently."
good,It's a nice company to work for u would enjoy just watch your hours they can be cut real low at any time. But otherwise it's very smooth work and friendly workers.
good,Great work experience. Variety of positions and associates that feel like family. Corporate needs to listen more to its hourly workers to understand the struggles they come up against.
good,"My immediate supervisor is great.  The HR department seems competent and fair.  The problem lies with all the ASMs running amok.  Some are helpful, others are spiteful.  Find yourself dodging them because who knows what they will require of you."
good,"The first lowes I worked at, it was like a family. Of course not everyone loved each other as normal, But I found a family at my old store, however due to moving, I'm at a new store and its not at all like that. Everyone is mean to each other for the most part and unwilling to help. Have to be lucky to get into a good store."
good,Stressful job for the pay! Micromanaged and expected one person to do what two people should do on the loss prevention side. A lot of teamwork with management.
good,"When I was there most co-workers, helpful, friendly and provided great customer service.  Management nearly invisible.  Formalized orientation but no formalized training after that. In over a year never had a review of performance.  Did though get a raise."
good,not very flexible on work hours requested more hours was denied was a good job for part time work nice people to work with and I loved the customer interaction
good,log into system to start taking calls.  Take a variety of calls from technical issues to procedural issues.  three breaks and 1 lunch pretty typical of a service desk.  assist stores will issues
good,"Helping people, fast paced, attention to details, Customer Service."
good,Management took the time and effort to train people as well as to work with the staff in order to fulfill the needs of the customers in a timely fashion.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Lowe's. I was a part time employee. I only left as I needed Full time work and Better Insurance then I was able to get as a part time employees. "
good,"Working at Lowes Home Improvement was really great. I loved my job and wish the season hadn't ended. During the time I was there the store had a restructuring of management so nobody really know who was supposed to report to who. There were a lot of changes, and confusion. I believe if this had not been the case, my opinion of the management team would be much better."
good,I enjoy the work in Pick and Prep and Floral department.The people I work with are great and we make a fine team.I wish the hours schedualed could be more stable.
good,Was decent for summer work. Being only part time for the job i was accepted for kinda sucked but for the most part was a decent all around experience and cant complain much.
good,"Top 5 store in company"
good,"Not my favorite place to work, but the people you work with are great. Management wasn't very good though, always pushing for extra and un-needed sales to customers. Customers were pleasant to help and work with."
good,I worked in lawn and garden - seasonal employee. enjoyed the people I worked with and being outside.  I hope to return next year for seasonal employment.
good,Lowe's allows the opportunity to cross train in varied departments. Always changing work environment staying current with the supply and demand of the public.
good,"I enjoyed working outside, self directed work environment and operating a fork lift. I learned more about inventory management and the importance of interpersonal communication."
good,"Working 2 part time jobs, an hour apart. Would prefer one full time closer to home, with benefits. Government rules limit benefits hours. Enjoy helping people, solving problems for customers. ."
good,"Assist customers, drive the forklift or other power equipment. answer phone calls. stocking shelves and making sure the customers were taken care of. Asking my manager what he wanted done."
good,"Lowes's Home Improvement is a great starting place for young people that are just out of high school, or people that are retired and looking for something to do in their free time. It is not a place to expect advancement in management, or for a career option."
good,I love my job being in charge of Sales. I just don't have a great work/family balance for what I get paid and the time it takes to move up. Certain Managers I have worked with are great and other are boring.
good,"Unfortunately in the department I work in, which is delivery, has been in such an array since corporate did away with department managers. We have been overwhelmed with multiple deliveries a day that have us on the road for an average of 12 hours a days. There have been times we stayed out 16 and a half hours then have to come back in the very next morning at 6."
good,"When I started at Lowe's it was a great place to work.  I made some great friends and the management was great.  Everybody cared about each other and made sure we were all doing well.  Then the company changed the store manager and that when thinks went down hill. Being a full time associate and guarantee 40 hours per week, when we did not make budget they would ask us to leave early or take vacation or holiday day."
good,"Lowes was a great place to work, it definately Team oriented. Lots of computer training on every facet of store."
good,My time at Lowe's was up and down. It was very dependent on the location. As far as retail goes the compensation was fair but like all retail jobs the hours are not conducive to any type of work life balance or general health.
good,"I started as a seasonal employee in outside garden. The management team saw what I did with helping customers and knowing product that we carried in the store. So they moved me up front to be a cashier where I was for a year then I moved to the cash office part time. They had a full time cashier so went for that, after about a year of cashiering I went to head cashier. After a year of being a head cashier I went to administrative department manager. Was there for a year then wanted to move out to the sales floor and moved as a department manager of electrical. After about 8 months my job got eliminated."
good,"I enjoyed my 5 years at lows "
good,Only looking to change career for better family hours.   Management is good and a friendly pkace to work.  Benefits are good and people are friendly. Compedative wages.
good,"excellent place to work"
good,Overall Lowe's is a good company to work for with good benefits especially for those who are retired or nearing retirement. Lowe's also offers a wonderful discount to our military veterans.
good,"Great for people who only can work part-time, perfect for college students. It wasn't exceptionally stressful and provided decent knowledge for those who are interested in learning about home improvement."
good,They are job but some stuff needs to change customer can say anything or do anything to you sometimes the managers will have your back and other times they wont.
good,Great place to work with good management. Only thing difficult for me was having to work shifts starting at five am or ending at eleven pm. Great management that would help with any issue.
good,"i enjoy working at lowes even though its a fast paced enviroment. The employees made it feel more like home, i learned to have more paticens not only with other people but myself. everyday that i would come in to work i would produce a plan to effectivley take care of customer concerns and mantaining the sales floor"
good,"It is what it is folks.  A big box store.  Depending on the management team, it can be a fun place to work.  As long as you do your job, you'll be fine."
good,Overall Lowe's is not a bad place to work if you are making it a temporary thing. Some days are stressful due to how others treat you. But your experiences are what you make them. I continue to work there because Lowe;s affords me health insurance and time off when requested.
good,Very fun place because of the people you work with. Sometimes I found joy in helping people with home improvement projects. Pay was not good but nothing less than you could expect.
good,"Long work days"
good,"Lowe's was a great company to work for. The people in my department were very nice and they were always super helpful. There were times, though, where we were understaffed and it gets really stressful when there are only a couple people working on a busy day and when people go on lunch there are only 1 or 2 people taking care of the paint desk, which can get very hectic for the employees and for the customers. All in all, it was good working here and I would work here again."
good,It was good to help individuals but the management was not very professional. I learned to be patient with customers as well as co-workers. The company has people of different academic and social levels and so at times it is difficult to operate on a more or less save level of understanding.
good,"I worked in the paint department and is constantly busy.  You learn how to multitask and work under pressure.  Time goes by quickly and can be fun when you get to work with nice people.  However, it can be stressful because we are always under staffed and some freight, down stocking, and zoning cannot get done as expected by the managers.  Majority of the managers are sympathetic and aren't too on you for not getting stuff done."
good,Very high paced and demanding.  Poor work/life balance.  Good benefits ability to move up with good work ethic.  High stress position as you move up in management.
good,"A typical day of work at Lowes includes down stocking to ensure that customers have every item available for them. Learned how to do installs for customers. As long as you get your work done, it is an easy job. The hardest part about the job is having to deal with complicated customers."
good,"Forget about taking any vacation days because they will be denied. This place is looking for people that only work, work, work, and have no social life."
good,"It was ok. Water plants, move stuff, talk to stupid customers that think I'm the go to person when all I was required to do is move stuff and water plants. Had high pressure attacks and the required me to sign that I was quitting by my own free will when all I needed to do was go to the doctor for medicine."
good,"I did not work at Lowes for more than 4 months. I was well aware that the employees were all fairly young and were not welcoming to others. It was mostly professional, but managers seemed to favor some other employee due to tenure."
good,"Lowes for me, was a great job after my fast food job. I really enjoyed the atmosphere there. For me, working in a warehouse was a great feeling and was a great place for my growth"
good,"In the busy season (Spring, Summer), this is a fast paced and at times stressful job. In the offseason, things relax a little bit. A typical day is helping customers with any needs and making sure product is stocked and ready for purchase."
good,"People are nice and understanding. I learned about different types of wood, nails, flowers, etc. The most enjoyable part is getting to interact with the customers."
good,"Lowe's was never going to be more to me than just a job. I was fresh out of high school and needed to start making money. Through all of my experiences at Lowe's, I learned that the real world is not the place you would expect it to be. ""Work hard and you can make a lot of money"" they said, I do not feel the hard work I put into this company was much recognized and compensated for. Lowe's was a good start, but is not where I would see myself settling."
good,Management ran the stores warehouse and freight teams too lean for superior service. The Corporation supported the stores but limited ordering certain core products to exceed sales goals. Daily dealing with the customers was a pleasant experience and gave us the tools to help each customer.
good,"If you want to make money, learn how to build a house, and never see anyone but the people you work with, then Lowes is a great place to work. The benefits are amazing, but you have to work hard to have them"
good,I like my coworkers and my customers.  They made my days fun and helped me get through the bad days when I had them.  Management was not to bad you had those ones that did not belong in management.
good,Working here for almost 2 years has let me see how everything is handled in this company and apart from a few unpleasant employees working here was a fun job
good,Worked as cashier but didn't know a lot of the store due to not a lot of familiarity with the items sold.  Worked there for a seasonal job and then finished.
good,I was a very loyal employee for Lowes but upon transferring to a store in the Boston area things changed drastically.  I was asked (forced) to work 80 hour weeks and that is when we parted ways.
good,I feel I have met people who are interesting and diverse in culture. I have trained new cashiers over the 12 years I have been with the company. I have learned to be assertive enough to get help when needed and courteous enough to help the customer get their purchases checked out and loaded. I have learned to handle customers who are angry. I have dealt with a variety of situations and handled them with tack and with the best of my abilities.
good,"Lowe's is very fast paced because of the amount of customer traffic. Sometimes there was not enough staff to cover the workload. But, overall it is a nice place to work."
good,"Whether it be to buy a replacement bulb, fix a leaky faucet, plant a garden or build a house you will help your customer love where they live.  "
good,"Lowe's is the opposite of Home Depot.  They focus on the homeowner and not as much as the contractor business.  The company seems to periodically go through restructures which affect job security.  The financial rewards are not that substantial, however, the 401k plan is excellent."
good,"My job had a steady fixed schedule, basic pay, but management wasn't very good, and pay could have been better. The atmosphere was nice to work in. A good job to start in the retail environment."
good,"I very much enjoy what I do, and the customers that I help everyday that I go into work. Lowes, in general, is a wonderful place to work. There is a lack of accountability from management, and the talk that goes on among associates and co workers gets out of control."
good,Lowes recently changed managers. They let certain things go for instance. Everyone who works there full time should know how to run power equipment. (Fork lift or Narrow aisle exterder) but they don't press it and the people who do have to do more than their fare share of work. It promotes bad attitudes.
good,Lowe's was a great place to work at until they changed the tier and shifted power of management and refused many opportunities to associates that have been working hard to move up. The benefits are great but there seems to be too many cuts to save money that affect the moral of the employees and the jobs they are asked to perform.
good,"Good company to work for, but with the new management structure, there is little room for advancement.  The talk is about advancing laterally, meaning knowing more departments without having to pay more."
good,"Was a decent job while I was between jobs.  Worked all over the store, especially the busy departments.  Always seemed like we were short handed everywhere."
good,"Good Company to work for however moving up in advancement at the store level is not promoted nor recommended. However at the RDC's they do promote the employees from within, it is the store level that does not promote as long as you are doing your job well. However those that do not do their job will not get moved on from unless they leave themselves."
good,"did the trick in paying bills.easy hours, management not very capable of handling every day situations. To much change with a trial and error mentality."
good,"Ive learned a lot at lowes over the years, the fast paced learning environment helped me learn many new skills. like re keying locks, driving forklift and using power tools"
good,"Great benefits, fun and active environment. Sometimes work can be a little hectic. The paint department is so much fun. Kind of like playing in paint as a kid. Matching colors and mixing. Just the best job there. Best pay in store would be the Specialist position, pricing cordinator, install sales, or manager position."
good,Lowes changed some things recently and it has made it very hard for  advancment especially if your a cashier. very odd hours so dont get used to a sleep schedule you wont have one
good,"You will sweat, but it is a great summer job. The only negative thing I can say is that if you get to stay after summer, you will not get 25 hours a week."
good,good place to work but no job guarantee and not managed well.they really need to work on their scheduling. but the co-workers are very good. they have a bad reputation of firing people.
good,loved the interaction with customers schedule wasn't very good for home life. Management was ok opportunity to advance was always an option. Overall good place to work for paid well for what your expected to do.
good,Good company to work for. Employees stay around for a long time and many are very happy working for this company. Lowe has a challenging environment and is very fast pasted.
good,"Loved working here, but there is little room to advance. They say they like to hire from within however hire outside candidates instead. Great coworkers, good management, and decent pay."
good,The company was a good company to work for.  Excellent opportunity to advance depending on what your career path choice might be.
good,"When working at Lowe's, my daily routine includes helping customers decide what kind of lumber they would like, helping them carry their lumber to their car, and loading it into their car."
good,I have been with Lowe's for 10+ years but they are now cutting a large amount of jobs. It is sad to see such a great family atmosphere deteriorate before your eyes.
good,"Schedules vary weekly based on days work and time worked, making it hard to have a life outside of work. Management is great and great coworkers. Bad benefits."
good,"The comany is a great company  to work for "
good,"Enjoyed working there as long as the drama free employees weren't around.  Management was good, but HR took a long time when you request things."
good,"a standard workday at Lowes usually consisted of  shelve stocking, maintaining the sales floor/ isles clean and clear , and assisted fellow store associates with customers. As a major hardware store most associates usually jump back and forth to a number of different departments, such as paint, carpet, gardening, lighting, and many other departments. Sometimes we performed other duties for the store, such as cashier and warehouse work."
good,"keeping lumber stocked,and prouduct filled on shelves typical day at work keeping lumber stocked helping customers hard part about this job was flat stacking lumber coworker we all worked as a team the most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team made the job more enjoyable"
good,"Very busy throughout the summer, Compact Sod has great management and has a very friendly work environment. A typical day includes sales through the phone, and staying on my toes knowing various promotions and answering assortments of questions from customers."
good,I'm alway's on the move because I have many people asking to do things. Management is has a little problem with communicating with the other co-workers.
good,"Management does not back employees up, they will ""throw you under the bus"" in front of customers and to your face. Management also does not lift a finger to help anywhere."
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for I just wish they would open up more full time slots. They are about team work and helping their customers love where they live
good,"As a Customer Service Associate some of my responsibilities were                                                                                                                             "
good,I liked helping people and all the things that were sold there.  I thought the pay was low and the hours were not very family friendly.  II don't have much else to say
good,"If you speak up or have a suggestion that is contrary to the status quo, management has ways of letting you know. If your good at what you do and are happy doing it they think your up to something."
good,Fun environment because of the people who work there. The leadership was hard at times and didn't take suggestions on improvement very well. the pay and benefits were acceptable for the time being but not a place to make a career out of.
good,Usually busy throughout the day. Being head cashier requires fast thinking and quick pace. The management was great to work with but some of the associates were harder than others.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's even when medical conditions began to surface in my body. I enjoyed learning how to drive a forklift. I enjoyed working with people who love to do home repair and carpentry. I was upset upon my date of leaving when I was told by management that I would be listed as not able to be rehired. I still don't know why they put that on my record. I was hoping to transfer from the Glenwood Store to the Grand Junction Store and continue working. But when they put that on my record, that became impossible. I would have loved to be able to do that. Instead I struggled to find another job that I enjoyed as much as I did working at Lowe's."
good,"1.greeting and assisting customers.2.new product information.3.management could have been more helpful to their fellow employees.4. they were , for the most part,a great  group of people, willing to help one another and friendly.5. walking on concrete  floors for hours at a time . working with and helping people."
good,"Every day at Lowes was different. They allow for cross-training in multiple departments. I learned how a distribution center works. Management has an open door policy, but there are few people who take advantage. Management wanted super production done, but wondered why there were so many work related injuries. Co-workers were the best part of the job. Being on the floor themselves, they understood the traffic and demand and some employees would even stop what they were doing and help to re-stack fallen pallets."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work for part-time income. Managers are understanding, helpful and curteous. I have learned about many products that I would not have been exposed to if I did not work here.  I have also been encouraged to tackle new home improvement projects based on the knowledge and expertise I have acquired."
good,"Always a typical day at work. Do your job at your best. Give your greatest customer service. Being friendly with co-workers. I did not see any hard part for my job being in the cash office or at the customer service desk I always find myself enjoying what I do, being accurate, efficient and being great in dealing with customers whoever they are  what ever they are still  the same service I will provide. I make my customer happy."
good,"Working outside is a plus, and the most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction I can provide to the customer. The employer is decently laid back. The hardest part of the job is the manual labor. The bags of mulch and rock are very heavy."
good,"After clocking in and finding out where you will be working your shift starts you could be doing the job you were hired for or any job they need help with at the time. The one part of this job I enjoyed was getting to know the regular customer that came into the store and enjoying conversation with them. I discovered like any other job there is a lot of gossip that goes on in a business, this also includes the management. I found out early who you could tell your issues to and who you couldn't. The hardest part of the job would have to be not having a set schedule my hours were always different as were  the days I worked so it was hard to plan a life around this job."
good,"The hours were good, they worked very well with my school schedule. The breaks were very short and I loved all my guests that came through my line! Holidays were super crazy and I wouldn't be able to leave that day until very late. My coworkers were awesome but at the beginning of my job I was on my own a lot. I eventually got the hang of it but I learned by myself."
good,lowes is a typical retail job except great pay and good benefits. if if retail is your thing i would definitley tell you to apply there
good,"I've been working with Lowe's for a year now and while I am not a huge fan of where I work, it's still considerably better than most retail jobs out there. My only complaint would be some of the politics and favoritism with some of the management and like all retail jobs having to deal with the cliques and people trying to get rid of you for stupid and petty reasons. They are one of the few companies I know of that offers benefits to part-timers which was a big deal for me even though management tried to tell me that the coverage wasn't that good, but that's if u go with the cheaper insurance. I worked for a medical office and know how insurance works so if you're willing to pay a little more you will get better coverage. Overall not a bad company to work for but still a retail job where unless you produce the numbers they want and are close with management, you won't get promoted."
good,"Busy and hardworking days - great coworkers, lack of help (not enough workers) so as a result a greater risk of being injured and not being able to provide proper customer service"
good,"Overall, Lowes itself is excellent. I have nothing to complain about, as the company does seem to try and take care of both employees and the community. My coworkers have all been amazing to work with."
good,"I loved working in the outdoor garden area, plenty to do and lots of sun. Lowe's like to treat their employees as often as possible, expect lots of BBQs"
good,gained the necessary experience to work in a fast pace setting. Was able to interact with all kinds of customers. enjoyed the diversity.
good,"Typical day is stock shelves, walk the floor and provide customer service.  Co-workers are friendly and mostly helpful.  Good management team."
good,"This is a good place to work if you want to advance up the chain, and have time to dedicated the majority of your time to the company."
good,Co-workers are amazing and incredibly hard working. It has been a rough reopening of the deli due to some poor corporate and management decisions. However we all do the best we can to make it a welcoming atmosphere.
good,"Summer has long hours, driver cohesion is good as long as management does not try to switch things too much. When a driver and helper work well together, it makes things slow down considerably when management sends someone without any experience out with you. Hardest part of the job is long days lifting heavy appliances all day. It is extremely exhausting and physically demanding."
good,"We as employees chose to have potlucks just to have fun, if a cashier moved to customer service or someone to the floor we liked to celebrate the advancement. We were all close and helped each other in our departments. Helping customers customize their home was always an experience. Knowing your turning a house to a home was an amazing feeling."
good,"I was glad to work for Lowes, & very satisfied with my hours. I gained a lot of experience cashiering as well as stocking merchandise and helping organize goods."
good,Work isnt to stressfull and had good benefits. Bi weekly paychecks are hard to adjust to. People are very friendly and have good work ethics.
good,"fun productive co workers,management good.Hardest part of job a lot of lifting.the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and  going to lunch with co workers.I learned how to enter orders into internet and customer service is the best way to have customers come back to your store."
good,"fun work place, great employer and co-workers, loved to work for lowes because you are able to help in other depts which helps to cross train. always meeting and helping new and old customers each day."
good,"Working with my employees was always good we helped one anothe, loved helping out my customers as well in meeting their needs. I loved my job that I didn't have a problem where I was put, I was an willing to learn more to improve an make it a career."
good,"Its a nice and fun place to work because majority of the co-workers were very kind and never gave me a bad attitude. They also made it very comfortable and never made me feel like I had to be someone else."
good,"Lowes overall is a great company, But prepare to dedicate your life to them, Work 7-9 days without a day off and sometimes closing the store at 11pm and have to open and be back by 5:30am. "
good,Fun work place. This is a very fast passed environment.  The stores have a very family like feeling between the co-workers.  Plenty of opportunity for growth and development as well as upward movement for self driven people.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's consist of helping customers, stocking freight, and keeping a safe work area. I have learned how to make a customer's day go from bad to good. Management tries to keep the work place organized and everything continuously going well. My coworkers work as a team to help customers and stock freight, making the typical day go smooth. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with customers."
good,It was amazing working there. Especially in the garden area employees where always on top customer service. Just management was very poor in communicating to employees and customers. Breaks where never given to employees only lunch. The head cashiers where always fighting with each other. All this was like that when I was working there.
good,"if you need work, experience, and do not mind a rotating shift with a place that is about the numbers. it is a calm work place with no stress at entry level."
good,"The company is strong, but any retail environment provides work/life challenges. When the schedule changed week to week, it was difficult to establish consistent family time."
good,"Not bad of a job but hard to advance.  Managment needs some work.  My co-workers are excellent to get along with, there is also somewhat team work."
good,I loved what a did here. I was with the public and loved going to work here. the pay was not great but in all the job made up for it.
good,"put my PPE check my time card, receive instruction for the manager about the work check al the products to put on the shelf, check the machines to use, forklift, reach truck etc, and proceed to  stock the products"
good,"Management was horrible, they didn't care about their employees. they want to make your life difficult. my coworkers were awesome, Not a difficult job,"
good,"Working at Lowe's can be very fulfilling. I enjoy helping customers and solving problems for customers, however the retail environment can be very frustrating because of the crazy hours and lack of staffing which leads to the job being more difficult than it needs to be. Working at Lowes I have learned a lot about how to provide effective and satisfying customer service, as well as how to train new hires and be an essential part of a team."
good,"Learned to work is sales and management in a fast pace retail store. Was over multiple employees and departments. Ordered own product unloaded own product, coordinate receiving department. Looked over sales employees overall sales and contractors. Made scheduling and did merchandising."
good,"A typical day as a Head Cashier at work is a constant challenge to the brain. Between monitoring my cashier's lunches and breaks to tending to any and all customers while still following store policy, my current job can be hectic. When management decides the hours for the front end team, my responsibility is to ensure that everyone attains a lunch and a break, and maintain a constant flow of customers through the checkout line with as little problems as possible. Not only do I monitor the schedule, but I analyze our Extended Protection Plan program. To increase the percentage of EPPs sold, I hold training sessions with employees to ensure they are comfortable selling these extras to customers including the Lowe's Credit Card. The hardest part of the job is working with so little. Especially with my own hours being cut, I deal with what I've got. Schedule cuts make is extremely tough to get lunches covered. I enjoy working with most co-workers. I set an example of what I expect from each and every employee. When things go south, I remain calm and handle the issue at hand and move to the next. Stressing out makes others stress out. So I've learned to remain in control, so that others are comfortable, that I am the role model for my cashiers and what I do impacts their decisions, and I've learned that with supervisory positions come with a lot of responsibilities."
good,"Stocking, learned how to improve my own home, management is ok varying by person.  I enjoyed working at Lowe's at times. Sometimes it is hard to advance. In my opinion If you do your job too we"
good,Started out great but after a while management changed and morale went down. Spent the last year doing the jobs of other associates and not getting recognized for all of my hard work
good,"Pull reports"
good,"I worked in a variety of positions, Holding account clerk, auditor and runner. I never felt that people understood the positions I filled with my  background in inventory control I often trained entry level managers which caused some difficulty when I entered the operations side of the business.  I often pointed out procedural errors as part of my Holding account and auditor positions, this led to difficulties as a runner in that I still felt compelled to do the right thing.  Most good managers were ok with this but some were not.  I was considered a threat and  held accountable for doing what I had always done."
good,"workday includes unloading racks of product  trees ,flowers  from trucks to tables ,watering marking down distressed plants. helping customers with zero scpe options. least favorite thing was not enough people in all departments.I loved the people that work at lowes' no hardest part other than short staffing."
good,"Great customers, fast paced environment. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Pay was good, and the benefits were OK."
good,Lowe's is a face to face company. The majority of our days are driven by meetings.  We also are offered a variety of training courses. The atmosphere is truly amazing.  The hardest part of my job is actually finding time to complete Documents/Reports as we are often in meetings.
good,Sales and marketing meeting and greeting customers helping with credit payments and project answering question on products .
good,"overall I enjoyed my time at Lowes... My issue stems with management. other then that employees were nice enough... just be careful, cause the rules are not overly specific and you'll be thrown under the bus to cover someone other then you."
good,Lowe's is great company to work for while in school. The management was fantastic. I was always explained the primary goals for each day which is very important. Customer Service positions are very easy in my opinion because I'm such a people pleaser. I feel most people in retail are underpaid. You will understand after working for a great company like Lowe's.
good,"processing returns"
good,"The coworkers are great, but the inconsistent hours can be difficult on the home life.  Everyone is really nice and friendly and try to make customers feel welcome."
good,"Great place to work and I love what I do. I enjoy finding creative/innovative solutions to customers' projects with my extensive product knowledge. My department is generally self sufficient and management, for the most part leaves us to our own devices as long as we make our numbers."
good,It's retail. It's not particularly fun or fulfilling. The people (employees not customers) are good but the management has some issues and disconnect with the floor associates. Working with customers at a hardware store can be particularity daunting as most of them have no idea what they want or what they're talking about.
good,"work a lot of hours and don't get time to spend with family, overall good company just needs better corporate level teams"
good,"typical day at work is always the same"
good,"this retail corporation does not care for there employees they way they say. A typical day of work is order management on current orders, calling vendors/customers for follow up, restocking shelves, assisting new customers with customer orders choices. I loved my little team that worked in my department we made a great team. the hours were hard but you did it. the most enjoyable part of the job was  the work I did in interior design. The WHOLE project and follow up."
good,Unwillingness to give raises at appropriate and reasonable time results in people not liking their jobs.
good,"I have been with Lowe's for a year and some weeks and so far the job is a decent job. The moral of the store where I work is not as high as it should be, but overall the store is striving in the right direction. It could be a little bit more fun and employee friendly, yet the store is straight to the point of driving sells and maintaining high market trends."
good,"A typical day of work will consist of maintaining merchandise in the store and making sales to consumers. This job provided me with much knowledge in all the product since they must train you in the applications of these products and make good good sales, not just know where the product sits on the shelf. management was great and worked well with your personal needs. Co-workers worked well in team situations and apply themselves fully every day. There was not necessarily anything difficult about this job. The most enjoyable part of working at Lowe's was getting to see the new faces every day and seeing how I could help finish someone's new project with them."
good,"A typical day was waiting on customers, working up job bids, selling the job writing up contract....putting up stock"
good,"•	Described use and operation of merchandise to customers"
good,"A typical work day consisted of arriving a little before 7. Promply at 7 clocking in and running the receiving reports that I was responsible for daily.  I processed all items received from the day before, and contacted all discrepencies with vendors. I also scheduled all incoming and outgoing freight.  Kept all records accordingly per company policy."
good,"Driving Forklift, Unloading trailers, Stock merchandise. "
good,Meetings in the morning followed by covering other associate's departments for lunch. Constantly in other areas of the store other than mine.
good,Its one of the best retail jobs that you can work in but it is just hard to move up in the company.
good,Extensive use of part time employees. benefits for part timers are similar to full time benefits. Offer opportunities for the first time job seeker. A safe place to work with much stress on safety. Good recognition of succ.essful performance
good,"you will be required to do a lot of training on the products sold and learn a great deal of info, excellent family work environment, downfall is that it is a corporate company which leads to lack of job security"
good,Very busy at desk dealing with Contractors. Out in the field one day a week Outside sales.
good,"Hard work, requires lifting and loading. Pay is decent. Irregular schedule can be hard to plan time off."
good,"I started at Lowes as a teller and after months of working I got promoted to a Head Cashier. I was responsible for managing the front end (all cash registers, all cashiers, customer service desk, returns desk, etc..). I learned how to balance, and maintain the cash registers and manage about 10-15 cashiers at one time (customer issues, breaks, lunches, etc..). I enjoyed being able to create and maintain relationships with co workers as well customers. The hardest part of the job became when management made a big change in the store by getting rid of certain managers (store manager, assistant store manager, etc..) and brought in a new team."
good,Lowes is a good place to work if you can get a position that is full time. it seems as though that they hire a lot of part time employees to fill the needs of a full time position. if you can get the hours to make ends meet it is a friendly environment and the employees are very welcoming
good,"It is what it is. If you want to advance into higher paying jobs, expect to have a degree, not that you'll need it, but because they require it to weed out the nut jobs I suppose. Coworkers are ok..."
good,"Typical day includes interviews, onboarding, filing, and meeting with business partner to determine the needs of the store. The hardest part of the job is finding a work/life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet different people."
good,"I held a position with Lowe's as I was completing my first bout of college.  It was one of the funnest job I had, and met some great friends.  I enjoyed a lot of autonomy, as we were able to control our own delivery routes, and the amount of deliveries we had to complete on a daily basis gave us incentive to complete deliveries quickly and correctly so that we could have enough time to enjoy our afternoons and lunches."
good,"Got in at 4 a.m., proceeded to receive and unload freight, moved it to the floor and stocked areas as needed. After freight was received daily, went onto sales floor. Worked primarily in indoor and outdoor lawn and garden, however would also fill-in in hardware, plumbing, appliances and cashier as needed. I learned that customers can be very rude, but they come first and you need to do all you can to make it right for them and give them 100% of you. Management was inconsistent. Store manager rarely came out of office, but was not a people-person and didn't establish a relationship with his employees. Zone Managers were good - they were once the associates and could relate to us. They did a good job of running the store. Co-workers were very friendly and well-liked and almost everyone had a great work ethic and worked hard to help each other too. We all became proud of what we were doing, as if it made a difference in our community. The hardest part of the job was listen to customer's complaints - even if you knew they were trying to scam the store - and take ownership of their problem and give them 100% of you dedication to fix their problem. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and the company benefits."
good,Great place to work for flexible schedule. You never stop learning at this company.
good,People were great to deal with and the management was fair. Each day brought a new experience.
good,Not a great career choice. But good while in college. Learned a lot about different skills.
good,"Fun, people are nice and great environment. Your work life takes over your life. Even if your part time, you will work 6-8days in a row with one day off in between. You may only work 4 hours a day, but you are there. Sometimes your chances of advancement are good and sometimes, with certain managers, you are looked over and you start to feel you have no other qualities but being able to work on the floor. I have experience in office work cash office and clerical, but have been passed over for these jobs for people they know."
good,Helping customers with projects as well as going to job sites is AWESOME
good,This company offered many perks at its facility including multiple restaurants and a pharmacy on site.
good,"A good job in you need a job desperately. Do not expect any advancement unless you are one of the favorites of management."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being outside and helping customers with there everyday needs. Management had a lot to be desired. No one in management stayed for more than2 years. Co-workers were just your average people trying to make it day to day. What I learned working this job was that this wasn't something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. A typical day here was; you go in at what ever time your were needed and worked your shift. You did things like stock shelves and helped customers. I think the hardest part of the job for me was knowing that it would take a while before I received a promotion or received the hours that I needed.
good,Ok for part time and summer job not a full time position to advance in
good,management was great  and employees always received free food.
good,"I have worked at Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse for the past 4 years and 7 months. I began there as a typical front end cashier, and was moved then to customer service associate, and finally promoted to full time lumber cashier. My duties have always included more than simply ringing up customers and pointing customers in the right direction. I have spent much of my time there not only helping customers on the floor when I can but also helping customers load their items into their vehicles, helping departments with various tasks, helping with closing procedures during the closing shifts, organizing returned merchandise and sorting it to it's necessary departments, handling customer questions and concerns as well as preforming various customer service tasks to help their shopping experience become better. The most enjoyable part of my job has been being able to help others get the things that they need and being about to still preform hands on tasks throughout the day. The part that I would say was hardest about my job is handling customers who are so upset that they cannot be consoled by just a cashier or sales associate. My co-workers are all very hardworking and work well as a team, however there are those who do a little more work than others. Management does lack a little in it's communication with the store, but tries different techniques to try and get all of the associate's informed on the latest updates and procedures. Since being employed at Lowe's, my customer service and multi-tasking skills have strengthened greatly. I have also learned several clerical tasks,"
good,"The most satisfying part of my job was helping customers determine what they need and helping them resolve issue."
good,"I would work over time always went in to help out was always treated badly, some managers were rude but I loved the job and the customers"
good,"Working with Customers is huge in any retailer, but with Lowe's it seems to be the number one goal. So much so that it may seem difficult to get your other duties accomplished. Time management is something that you will learn and find very difficult to split evenly between task and customer service one will always suffer. The management staff can be your best friend or you worst enemy depending on your store manager. Their tone will set the theme for the entire store. In all the stores the employees are like family, very enjoyable, knowledgeable and overall that is the best part of working at a Lowe's. The jobs day to day task depending on position can be the most challenging part of working. Over all the years at Lowe's were great I would recommend them to anyone looking to find a first or part time job. Calling it a career maybe a stretch"
good,Very limited work life balance. Long hours worked especially during the summer months.
good,"Everyday is different, the best part is wondering what project a customer will come in with next. I have learned a lot, from flooring to roofing due to customers. Management needs serious work, but on the other hand, co-workers are great."
good,Lowes is a very hard place to work for managment is terriable and does not want to work with employee schedules and they dont understad about family life.
good,"Good ""part-time"" job, to fill the need to keep yourself busy."
good,I loved checking groceries!!  The most enjoyable job I have had!! I even enjoyed stocking and cleaning the isles.
good,Great corporation.  Cares about employees.  Great advancement capabilities.
good,"I have learned a lot while working here from a lot of great people. The company is changing directions, not sure if for the better or not."
good,"The pay is competitive, so the company pays well and they offer amazing benefits for part time, and even better for fukll time. The work environment has become rather negative since i first start working there. It seems it become more about the money to our managers rather than real customer service. But this could also just be the store I work in, my boyfriend worked for a different Lowe's and he laughed when I told him how things were ran compared to his. Overall I really do like my job and would recommend anyone considering applying there too give it a shot!"
good,Good work place environment. Friendly co-workers and clean store.
good,"I would show up on time at 4am. Would go to receiving and unload semi trailer of product with other employee's. Place products on pallets, per section of store they were to be taken to. operated forklift to unload product that was to big to hand unload. transferred pallets to proper department and would help floor employee's to put product on shelves. i was trained in field of driver and delivery of household appliances and other products. I learned new ways to be expedient and work safely within my work place. my immediate management was great and fair, but store manager terminated me for working for another company, that wasn't work wise related as a competitor. My co-workers were fun to work with, but some were unable to work properly, unless their hand was held through every process. The hardest part of this job, was hand carting the bigger appliances and finding ways to stay busy. the most enjoyable part was keeping everyone laughing and enjoying the es spirit de corps among each others company."
good,"Customer service "
good,"I personally would not make this a career move.  Each day you will have a variety of tasks, and your always on your feet, moving things, and working face-to-face with people.  If you are a female, customers can become a bit sexist at times.  Management was hit-and-miss.  If you were lucky, you had good managers.  However, a lot of the good managers are the ones who get walked out.  If you get a good one, they are wonderful, and you will feel great reporting to these people, as they recognize all your hard work and efforts.  If not, it will be a very corporate feeling.  The hardest part of the job would be product knowledge, especially if you are working all over the store versus a certain department."
good,I loved my job and the team that I worked with. I learned a lot about financial services. The hardest part of my job was the lack of hours that I was given.  
good,"I greeted people as they were checking out.  I learned customer service and handling cash, checks, etc.  My managers were nice and easy to get along with.  The hardest part of the job was handling upset customers but I was pretty good at it. I enjoyed meeting people and helping."
good,"It's an overall ok place to work, if you want to make it a career and move up you have to be real good with the hr and managers. "
good,It's a nice clean environment to work in; much better than Home Depot.
good,"You are constantly busy, and you are yelled at if you aren't busy! I honestly loved my job at Lowe's, but retail is hectic."
good,"Lowe's has a program called retire rich. It is a 401K, stock purchase, company match, program. I worked there for 3 years and had 15K in my 401 and the stock split twice."
good,"Lowes is not a bad place to work for. There is plenty of room for advancement and you can make this a career if you are into the industry. Keep in mind that it is Retail and that you may be required to work nights and weekends. I worked in receiving, so I worked Monday-Friday."
good,fun place to work and a good learning enviroment. friendly staff.
good,"Greeting and selling to customer is always fun! But if your looking for advancement, It's not here unless you know someone.."
good,"Very large store...you get your exercise working there. If you were willing to sacrifice your life and family time, then you could advance into management."
good,"Lowe's does a good job of providing for the retirement of it's employees financially but not from a quality of life standpoint. Most of your days are spent working 10 plus hours when in management and many times, upon moving up like in most retail fields, you have to relocate."
good,"Check Sales Customer Orders , talk to new and existing customers and spoke with management re sales expection needed to accompolish sales goal for the day, Spoke with co workers in same dept re customers and work related issues, dealing with customer complaints in the store, re co workers, Having a good sales day , have good communication with the management, and fellow worker."
good,"lowes is big on training if you like training join lowes,when i started at lowes it was awesome then the economeny went bad and lowes started micro manageing,after that the company downsized and the employees started looking for other jobs."
good,"Doing a lot of resets, and learning about new products. Management was decent to work for and as well as coworkers. The hardest part of the job was going to work at 4a.m. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different customers that would come in."
good,run my reports print them out file & keep them for 6 months. work well with my co workers. the hardest part of my job is having nough time to assist customers more
good,"most of the manegment was not that good, would of stayed if they would of hiredme on for more then just weekends"
good,"Worked for lowes part time while i went through school. i worked 4am - 1pm, then went to night school."
good,people easy to get along with. everyone knows what to do everyday.
good,Depends on which store you work at and what management team you have. Your job could be easy or it could be bad. My store was great when I first started working there. Now I am currently searching for another place of employement because I feel as though I am going nowhere fast with this company. This company had great values at first but they are slowly fading away.
good,This job and boss was understanding of my hectic ministry schedule at the time and allowed me to travel often.
good,A typical day at work always consist of customer complaints wich I took care of some of them. I learned to listen to the customer and take care of my associates and in return they will be bette employess. The hardest part of job was not being able to satisfy an upset customer. Was being able to promote hard working associates with promotions and that ment more money for them and there families.
good,"My day starts off by covering 15 minutes breaks around the store,mostly cashiers.Then i get sent outside to do carriages and bring them back to the store."
good,"Lowe's is, as a rule an extremely nice place to work. They make extensive training available to associates. Most times there is plenty of work to keep you busy. Management is a little iffy. Some managers are excellent at their jobs but some are not and they can make your life miserable. most associates are a delight to know, hardworking, helpful and knowledgeable in their areas. The hardest part is times when there is no work to do. The best part is when new freight comes in and you get to restock your shelves."
good,"Great place, good management team, great coworkers. I have learned a lot about home improvement, construction materials, and working around heavy equipment. This has been a learning experience that I have truly enjoyed and value."
good,"I like working at lowes a lot , theres so many people that came in there and i love to work with people. Everyone of my co-workers were great !"
good,"While I knew the position going in was temporary, I greatly enjoyed working here. My position was cashier/customer service. I enjoyed working with the various clients."
good,"A typical 8 hour day at work I mix paint, while maintaining customer service. I also order and cut blinds. I also cut carpet while making carpet details. The hardest part of my job is having to multitask some many task at once. I love the people I come in contact with everyday"
good,"The company is good, just a lot of re-structuring going on and a lot of change. Concerns with job security because of company uncertainity."
good,"A typical work day consist of interacting with customer daily. handling returns, answering incoming calls, processing credit apps, taking payments, looking up and processing invoices as well as operating the cash draw. Lowe's is a fun working enviroment. I would say that if you looking for a career it's hard to move up. There's people that been there several of years and still doing the same job they started off doing and maybe even getting paid the same. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was interacting with customer everyday and you get a quarterly bonus!!!!"
good,"At Lowe's everyday is a an adventure, sometimes it's a good trek, sometimes it isn't."
good,"What made it stressful, was alot of people didn't do their jobs, or didn't care."
good,It was a temporary position. I enjoyed my work while it lasted.
good,I liked working there. If i was paid more $$ I would have stayed. You learn something new each day.
good,Never knew what I would be doing once I arrived at work. Very nice people employed by lowers. Very busy!!
good,delivering things to customers homes
good,"A typical day at work would be answering phone calls, processing Internet orders in a timely manner. Confirming deliveries for the following day. Listening to customer's questions, comments or concerns. I've learned how to successfully provide superior customer service. My co workers pull their weight and are willing to help anyone if they can. The most trying thing about my job is having a customer issue/complaint that I can not resolve, (i.e credit card issues, complaints to a degree where it involves upper management.) I enjoy my job the most when the customer leaves satisfied."
good,If you are not a full time employee you will have hour totals for a week that range all over the map. The work is good and the products are great. The training is also some of the best I have received.
good,Can be stressful at times when it is busy. Your short handed a lot and it makes it hard to do your job correctly.
good,"Working for Lowes can sometimes be very rewarding, and other times not. Overall it is a good place to work with 401K and vacation time. Opportunities for advancement are abundant for those who work hard, however those who do not work hard are not held accountable by management. It is a company where policies and practices change on a regular basis."
good,"A typical day at work involves customer interaction, soliciting new customers, order management and installation scheduling. While being employed at Lowe's I have learned a lot about dealing with different types of people and overcoming many obstacles. The hardest part of the job at certain times are time management and quotas."
good,Great company and great pay not so great management and involvement with employees
good,Job is demanding but once you get used to it you will be fine. Definitely a workout. People are really nice and helpful as well. Always enjoyed coming to work.
good,"Not a bad place to work at but not the best place to work at. It’s just another job to get you by. Benefits are not that great, type of job you would want for part-time."
good,Worked at Lowe’s for a year. Learned a ton. Great work mates. Encouraged by new executive hires. Always challenging to work with the general public though.
good,Overall working at Lowe’s Home Improvement has been an amazing experience and has taught me a lot of things like working with people to complete a task and driving a forklift.
good,"Take orders from computer and start pulling them from the bays. Next, call customers to confirm orders and then start unboxing all confirmed orders. Finally, help driver with deliveries and installation."
good,It was my first call center job and I loved it. It was busy but I enjoyed it. You have to stay focused and professional. The customers can’t be a little rude but you have to stay patient
good,"Interesting place to work and advance easy, Companies focus is heading in so many directions it can be overwhelming but presents daily challenges and tasks."
good,"Hit the ground running at 5:45 work non stop all day mastering 6 jobs  1 responsible for putting money in registers, checking front end for inventory needs, restock snacks and drinks, 2 answer main line coming in and trying to assist customers and trying to find someone in the departments or management 3. Process returns  4  supervise all cashiers with any cash register needs overrides etc  5 the internet orders This was A Full time job but it was theHead Cashiers responsibility to down load order find someone in dept have them pull order then go in and stage for pickup  6 Ring cash register"
good,My position is fun and offers many different challenges. The management generally seems to care about the employee under them. This company seems to appreciate the customer service associates more than past companies I've worked for.
good,Its  A Fun Place to work for up and coming workers joining the workforce hard work is evident at this place Be Ready Learn Your position that you apply for it will pay off in the end.
good,management is around to help sometimes but sometimes you cant reall find them. working on the front end there is drama and sometimes hardly anyone gets along. it is busy and you help customers find what they need and check them out
good,"If you are willing to put in the time, you can advance at Lowe's. Everyone was really nice and willing to help each other. The only bad thing is the work-life balance when you get into management."
good,"Work life balance, but cutting jobs. "
good,"Lowes is a great place to work i learned how to manage stress better,developed more people skills,refreshed my memory on quick math. The staff is amazing they make you feel welcomed"
good,Hiring process took a little long even after I had received my job offer maybe about a two months but overall it was good environment. Staff was friendly
good,"Working at Lowe’s was a good first step into retail/customer service. While working there I was able to learn about how inventory worked, proper merchandise handling and some sales experience. Personally I loved sales and it’s where I felt I flourished but due to the unavailability of any sales jobs at the time I stayed as a loader for the full time I worked there . Really would’ve loved to have advanced into sales and carry on."
good,"the management is nice. employeers are nice. help you leanr some important techniques like customer service, organization, sales managment,  and comunication skills"
good,Retail hours suck and they have a customer centric schedule.  It’s hard to plan your personal life around their schedule.  Shifts are all over the place.  Compensation was good and the people are great
good,It was a very good place to work and would tell anyone to apply at this location. Worked just about everywhere in the store and made delivery’s there.
good,My job is to over see the cashier's and customer service associates help each one when and get the manager override through out the whole store  and open put the money in the drawers for the store to open schedule breaks and when I close put the money in the money bags and give to closing manager the money to put in the safe
good,It's a great place to work at. You can also move up in the company. In a lot of areas you pretty much train yourself sometimes. It all depends on the supervisor.
good,"If you don't mind working various schedules, days and nights this is the job for you. Hours scheduled are available 3 weeks in . Advance.  Pay is fair. Most managers are great."
good,I learn a lot on a day to day basis. I strive and am encouraged to complete my required daily goals and tasks. My peers push me to achieve greater satisfaction with the customer everyday.
good,"Great place to work, I was just offered more money at another job. Besides being the only Lowe’s with that department in Ohio it was a bit of an overload but adjusted"
good,Everything is fine. I had no issues working there.  Decent days off good atmosphere to work in. Nothing of note to complain about while I worked there.
good,A great place to learn and grow. Great team environment. Most of the management staff were sincere and honest people that take care of their associates.
good,"Good place to work pay someone desirable great place for someone to start out early in life managers other employees give sense of belonging work schedule , needs Improvement"
good,"For a long time, Lowe’s mission statement was to help customers love where they live. And in the process, I learned to love where I worked. A typical day at Lowe’s really depends on which position you’re in, but every job is positioned to focus on customers. When you go to work with a positive attitude and can help change the attitude of your customers, and make them happy, you can leave at the end of the day knowing you were success."
good,"As a merchandising service associate, if you enjoy working a mon-fri job in retail, it's a good deal. The only issue is the company is trying to replace people with lower paid people and many people are stuck in their positions as the chances to move up are very slim unless you transer back and forth from the merchandising team"
good,"Not a bad place to work if you are just starting for a job. This job is a very productive job it teaches the employee organization skills, communication with customers and the like."
good,Good job and easy to advance if you want.  Could use more coverage.  Overall good place to work.  Management let's you do your job without micro managing as long as you get the work done in time.
good,"The job in my experience was fantastic. I loved what I did on a day in and day out basis. The only issue I had with the company is an insanely high insurance price. With a child on the way I needed to find a similar job, but with more affordable insurance options."
good,It was a great place to work as a beginner coming out of high school I learned alot. They gave me the opportunity to learn every department within the store.
good,The hours were flexible so i could manage my class work and flield trips that were required while i went to college. I participated in extra activities Lowes did for the community like Breast cancer walks to raise money.
good,I work at Lowe’s as a load puller for delivery. I was a ride along for delivery I would get things ready to make the delivery while the delivery driver would greet the customer.
good,"I would appreciate more hours, better pay for amount of work that is expected, although customer service is priority,  so it is not always possible to complete work assignments."
good,"Complete management change, not what it was. At the time, Zone managers were in a chain... some were not good! Now paths to advancement appears to limited or restrictive, from an entry level position. No appearance of upward mobility. Good part-time job."
good,Lowes is a very dedicated workplace. They care about all employees and customers. Always has new things to learn and teach everyday. Super friendly and kind hearted people to work with on the daily.
good,Most everyone is very helpful with helping you if you get in a bind. They company it self was great when I had to take an emergency leave with my child. The were very understanding in our situation.
good,I was hired as a seasonal loader and ended up working 3 years there. In those 3 years I was trained in my job and cross trained in some others because the opportunity was there and I wanted help. In doing so I had more experience and skills to assist customers than other people working in similar fields.
good,The people I work with are generally friendly and helpful. The people I help are mostly easy to get along with. The supervisors are normally busy with their tasks and sometimes we have to ask someone from a different department to come in for overrides.
good,Loved working at this place up until the day I got fired. I was accused of bring ignorant about not paying attention to what I was bring charged for a candy bar. I was told do to your ignorance and not paying attention to what you were paying you are being fired.
good,their is room for improvement. company  needs to be truthful with there employees. There is constant change that is happening at the store level that comes from corporate.
good,"I loved lowes for most of it, great co workers and a great supervisor. At first I had just graduated high school and just moved out, so I was new to life. I started as a part time seasonal worker at $10.50 an hour great right? No. I got boosted from seasonal to full-time and I was expecting a nice raise but when it came to that I got $0.17. That was it."
good,Compensated fairly for job requirements. Helped with interpersonal skills while interacting with customers. Created great friendships with other associates.
good,"The communication is awful. The management is just as bad. I worked in appliances and I was a lady getting on a hyster having to maneuver heavy ranges, washers and dryers and only made $10.00 an hour and I also had to load these in people's cars and trucks with no help......shame on them because there was people standing around chatting all the time. But offered not an ounce of HELP."
good,"Clocking in for work, I would clean the warehouse. I’d operate forklifts and other power equipment to place pallets in a general area where my coworkers and I would be working for the evening. We’d unload freight from trucks, place them on pallets and distribute them onto the main floor of the main floor. If we did not have trucks the day of work, I would load shopping carts, cashier, help deliver and ship products within the area and other miscellaneous tasks."
good,"Job is pretty easy after you get your training and you get used to all the little things that you have to keep an eye out for. Working with customers is a bit of an ordeal, but that comes with any retail job."
good,Good place to work. Day shift hours and works well with a family life. Lots of benefits the worst part is the point system on attendance. Life happens and miscommunication could cost your job.
good,The job was good but the manager was bad because some people was late alot but no written up manager would let the people off with a pat on the back..
good,Working at lowes you can kiss having a set schedule good bye. You get to know your work schedule 2 weeks in advance but you only get one weekend off a month and then they schedule you for random times throughout the week.
good,I enjoyed working for lowes and would love to work there again. It was a well maintained place and everyone worked well together.i would work there again given the opportunity.
good,Lowe's used to be a fun place to work. I have a great team of co-workers who are helpful and easy to get along with. My biggest issue with Lowe's is the lack of advancement opportunity and the lack of challenge i feel in my current role. Looking for a change.
good,paid well for a part time gig. did it through college. seemed like a bit much with my course-load but I managed. I worked outdoors so that was nice sometimes.
good,"Nothing to say, this part of the survey process is ridiculous, i shouldn’t have to say anything to add a basic review of a company regardless. Very unnecessary"
good,I have nothing bad to say about lowe's i learned a lot about home improvement and i had great manager who would communicate with me openly about anything.
good,if you like getting discounts on tools then this is the place. all of the workers there are friendly and very approachable. management is easy to get a hold of if you need assistance also.
good,"I really enjoy working in the paint department.  I feel like I have truly helped the customer find the right paint product, accessories, and a color they love."
good,"Nothing out of the ordinary or anything that makes this place stand out. It was a stopgap part-time job so I could make money in college. While I did learn valuable communication skills and work ethic, it felt like a normal, disinteresting position."
good,"Everyone is so cool, and easy to get along with. The management is awesome, and will work with you thru any situation you have. They just only take awhile when it comes to Giving you certifications"
good,It was good working at Lowe's and meeting new people and the work was hard put it was fun. Learning new things and the pay was good and alot of overtime.
good,Always busy and engaged. Forward facing toward the customers and ensuring their best possible shopping experience. Working with customers of varied backgrounds and skill levels.
good,Good place to work everyone one is very friendly and good hearted people. They try to help you the best way they can. The managers are also very nice.
good,Muy buen compañerismo y ambiente para trabajar el sueldo creo si pagarán unos $3000 por quincena la gente trabajaría más tranquila en lo demás muy bien buenas prestaciones y cuidan mucho a su personal
good,"Great environment with great people, learned a lot about customer service skills. A typical day at work can be stressful because of its fast-paced environment."
good,"management wasn't the best but it also wasn't the worst. There were alot of hiccups. It wasn't orderly, and I had a coworker who was actually going through a hard time in secret because of a few managers she was working under, she was to afraid to talk about what was happening in fear of loosing her job."
good,The job atmosphere is very laid back.  It is a very corporate environment.  Everything by the book until I was injured and then procedure was not followed.
good,"My position is a great position the only thing is that its a lot of physical work heavy lifting but overall great position"
good,"I really do enjoy working for lowes I just want to persue other options, they have great managers, they work with your schedule and help you get to where you want to be."
good,"A typical day at work involves assisting customers in finding items, handling transactions over the phone and online, and operating returns.  I've learned how to deal with belligerent customers and de-escalation. management is generally good but contains some people who have very different values which makes workplace cohesion strained.  The culture seems to be very independent and self-reliant, the hardest part is finding fulfillment, and the most enjoyable part for me is organizing the returns area."
good,Lowes was a good job. Lost my job because of my criminal background check came through. I'm looking for a job that will give me an honest chance even with my criminal  background
good,"I would come in at 6:00 in the evening and work until 4:30 in the morning, Monday through Thursday, sometimes Friday. We would ramp up about an hour into shift and stay busy the rest of the night."
good,"They were alright, store manager was unprofessional. Work environment was about average, nothing special. Was my first job and I loved it when I started but was definitely a learning experience."
good,Lowe's was a very fast placed work environment that required multitasking ability on a daily. I typically spent each day balancing two departments while maintaining interior projects. The people that I worked with here where incredible and very supportive. Advancement opportunities have declined and being able to balance home/work life sometimes presented issues which ultimately led me to leave the company.
good,Greet customers and doing whatever job you are assigned are very easy to accomplish. There was never anything assigned that was difficult to do. Everyone was always happy to help
good,"*Buen ambiente laboral"
good,"The company is rapidly changing to increase market share. They are trying very hard to hard to change their processes, to better serve the customer.  It can be rewarding if you genuinely like to help people."
good,"I enjoy working at Lowe's and feel as though the pay is competitive with other retail employers. However, even that competitive pay is barely a living wage in 2019. With a bit more pay and weekends off I would go as far as to call it an excellent job. I would say the physical aspect of the job and the variety of tasks to complete is the best part."
good,"Offers minimal benefits. The co-workers are fun t o work with. Scheduling is pretty flexible. Remember, this is retail- weekends and holidays a required for hourly employees."
good,"Overall It is a good company to work for. Rotating schedules for full time associates.  Fast paced retail environment. Negative, the stores are generally under staffed."
good,Helped with my finances and good people to work with and good help with my forklift license. Decent pay and plenty of hours for work and easy paced job
good,Start at 4 am unload freight than stock freight clean up receiving unload appliances clean up the bullpen not bad but there could be more to do top stock freight
good,"People are very nice. No corporate stress. Sales must be better or equal to prior year to keep District Manager away from  the store.                                                               "
good,"They were very understanding of my health problems and it was a nice place to work, everyone was mostly friendly and easy to get along with and I would recommend it to a friend :)"
good,Good company to work for if you like to work directly with customers. The company drives for success all the time and works as a whole a family. I am glad I got the job great experience
good,Dilevery was ok. They do not care if you have a family at home or anything else. I could be home for an hour after working 10/12 hours and get called back in. This was as a driver and later a supervisor.
good,Lowe's is a very fast paced place to work. Always keeping up with the changing seasons can be a bit stressful at times. But finding the need behind the need and helping customers love where they live makes it a great place to work.
good,"I worked as a cabinet specialist for 6.5 years, and returned 4 years later as a Project Specialist of Interiors, a role that was eliminated by the new CEO due to profitability problems.  The staff were like family members which is why I remained at one store for 6.5 years.  However, management turnovers and sales expectations became stressful, and the 2% raises per year did not support the additional stress of remaining for a longer period in this role.  I will always be grateful for my time at Lowe's, and learned so much in the field of kitchens, baths, and appliances.  The benefits were extremely good!  However, this is not a place where one can advance professionally or financially without moving into management and enduring very long hours in a stressful role for little financial reward."
good,A typical day at work is basically coming in and getting stationed wherever is needed. Sometimes relieving others for break or just simply going to your work station and being there until the end of my shift.
good,"There are multiple shifts throughout the day that make sure the customer sees a clean store with fully stocked items. The stock team takes direction from the manager on duty. On delivery days the main aisles are full of palettes with goods for shelf placement and top stocking, with additional items in the receiving area if necessary."
good,"It's a great environment to work in if you like to be active."
good,Lowe's is a good place to work to hone your business analysis skills. Management was not overwhelming and I was mostly able to do tasks at my own discretion.
good,"My main manager is a jerk but the rest of the management team is great.  I enjoy my job and am able to make sure that I get 40 hrs a week.  They are very strict about not giving over time, not even a minute over.  Over all it is a good place to work."
good,It has its ups and downs but overall a great place to work it is a great company to work with I am a part of the delivery team and we work together to make sure each and every customer is satisfied with their product that they receive
good,"There are some perks there! Ppl special order products and return it   Lowe takes it back and discount it , I have fixed thing on my house that I would have never been able to afford"
good,Well I worked here for about 3 years max. I graduated high school an this was my first real full time job. Got paid good got good hours an it was just a good job overall. But I ended up having a family an the check just wasn’t enough so I moved to.
good,"As a lumber CSA, It was a pretty down to earth job,SOMETIMES LOL, there were a lot of drawbacks. My schedule was all over the place, and I was always left alone in my department for sometimes even my whole shift, and I was pulling orders for other empty departments at the same time so we got ALOT of angry customers because are department didn’t have anyone but me sceduled."
good,"I wish they cared even a little about family schedule, but hey did not. They only cared about the managers schedules. I did enjoy working there and helping people with there Home Improvement needs."
good,Definitely was taken advantage of. Worked my butt off and only my direct manager really cared. People have worked there for years but my 4 months there was awful
good,"Interesting job. Love Lowes as a customer, it has its issues for employees. Based in North Carolina, pay scale is geared for the South, barely a living wage in North Dakota."
good,I can only speak for overnight shift. Our team works great together and our overnight managers are some of the best managers I have ever worked with..
good,"Working at Lowe's can be challenging and yet rewarding.  It is a fast moving big box retail environment that demands dedication. Great People, Good Benefits."
good,customer service and Merchandising working to achieve a safe and clean store for customers to shop. Always working on time management and to make sure you have the product for customers.
good,They have people that know less than you giving you directions. I felt like the managers need it more training. I would recommend working in sales floor not at the registers.
good,"Good company, great benefits. The company is currently going through transition and stability in positions is uncertain."
good,"As much as there were complaints about the corporation as a whole, the coworkers were great in their team mentality. The benefits are hard to turn down. Biggest complaint was the on-staff downsizing that led to angry customers."
good,Lowes is a great place to work. The co-workers are really nice and cool. The staff are understanding and nice as well. The environment is chill and quiet most of the time. Lowes is just a good job.
good,When I started I really enjoyed this job you were able to move around and do different jobs.after 7 yrs you had to apply for different positions it felt like they chose who they wanted.
good,"when being a cashier you dont really get time to leave the area, so keeping yourself busy can be difficult. otherwise, its a easy store to work for and most management is good too."
good,"Very nice place to work. "
good,Lowe's itself is a wonderful company. Family-friendly with plenty of benefits. Upper management changes resulted in structural changes within the company (not surprising). Because of this the overall sense of job-security is low.
good,Overall I enjoyed my experience and made long lasting relationships with some great people. Only downside is fear of losing your job due to corporate decisions.
good,Good company to work for. Just stay hardworking and show up on time. It is a retail setting so times can be harder than others but it’s rewarding at the end of the day
good,In my particular area of work it could sometimes get stressful but they did pay me fairly. Sometimes the other parts of the machine would break down and that is really where the stress came from.
good,Lowes' is a great company to work for if you are into learning and developing skills involving home improvement. I've learned skills that will help me personally fix issues in my home and recommend to others. The company encourages you to learn each department to further your product knowledge to assist customers. In the 2 years of employment I have worked 4 departments and have a license for 2 of the 3 machines there. my main goal was to obtain a full time position.
good,Good hours. Good pay. A nice place to learn more about hardware/gardening. Management was nice. Customers were nice. Overall a friendly environment to work.
good,"Kind of a mixed bag. Half of the time I was just waiting in receiving for deliveries to come through, the we'd unload everything and then wait for the next one"
good,"Lowe's isn't a bad place, but it's retail with all that comes with it. Regardless of one's dedication and hard work, a decision can be made in some corporate office that completely upends everything. This isn't just a Lowe's thing, it's life in retail."
good,"Very pleasant environment to work at.  Clean and enjoyable.  Very pleasant associates, good training and advancement. Would recommend working here, good benefits, flexible hours."
good,I learned the basics of building. I have knowledge and experience in building multiple projects and housing. I learned the art of cementing and construction of side walks.
good,"The new CEO is making changes to Lowes that must tenured employees are unhappy with. The current management does not have the respect of their staff.  Lowe’s seems to be showing a lack of care for employees that have been there for any length of time. I feel that they would rather push seasoned employees out the door so that they may hire in younger, less experienced people at a lower rate of pay"
good,Typical day was managing services and associates to provide excellent customer service and complete required and needed tasks for business needs to provide an excellent environment for both customers and associates.
good,Over all this job has become very stressful for the low pay and la k of employees all ways has to cover more than one department until staff come in on their schedule.
good,"Bare bone staffing, leads to too much work for the few doing it. Shifts cut for share holder profits, when customer satisfaction falls b.c there aren't enough associates to help."
good,"Do what you say you will. Always show up. Bring every idea or thought to the table so that you are known within the company. The more you are known, the better advancement opportunities you will have."
good,"I liked being able to pull records of best selling grills, ordering more, stocking/ building them, have them sell, all at the fast paces required. I liked being my own entity of a fixed weekly time schedule not a rotating corporate schedule"
good,I enjoyed working there. Great support from management and staff. Competition with staff and management was great. Offering incentives to reach targets and goals was a good moral booster. Room to advance still a possibility even after company restructure. Having a great team of coworkers and management made it more possible to obtain targets and goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was growing the relationships of satisfied customers and closing the deals on the most challenging projects. I would work there again. Good luck to anyone looking to join the Lowe's company.
good,"Very friendly store"
good,"Lowe's was a good place to work, I worked in the lumber department from 6 or 8 until close. I would drive a forklift to stack the lumber into the bays, and would have to hand stack the bays that were at ground level."
good,Lowe's is all right to work at. I going to work my eight hours and go home.I did my job assembling management would tell me if they needed anything different are they needed some built. Like the job because it worked four days a week. Work Monday Tuesday Wednesday off work Thursday Friday and Saturday and Sunday off
good,"The store is usually busy so it keeps you occupied for the most part. I started off as a seasonal cashier and then transferred over to the pick up desk, cross trained in customer service. Working there I learned that you need to have a lot of patience when dealing with rude customers and employees. I wanted to excel and train elsewhere within the store and was not given the opportunity"
good,i love working at lowes but recently my lowes has been having pay cuts and lay offs so i have been seraching for a new place  management are all wonderful people and all my co workers are good people i love working with the public but cant do that with no hours
good,"I had the privilege of working as an unloader with a great crew! I really enjoyed my time at Lowes, they were fun, friendly, supportive, and professional. I would go back in a heartbeat if my situation allowed."
good,I loved and enjoyed what I did just didn't get enough hours and wanted a full time  position because need benefits. The managers and employees were awesome to work with and the company itself was very understanding and they would work with you on scheduling for the most part and I would have to say one of the bad things about working for them was I got thrown in returns by myself not knowing first button to hit but I learned faster that way.myself
good,"the people and job are great. its the scheduling that has a problem. and the lack of coverage around the store. if you're fulltime- apprarently, there is no availability, you have to work whenever they schedule you."
good,All around have had great experience working here. good management is so so but my manger is great to work for! Retail work is not the best but for Lowe’s it’s not bad.
good,Just not the job I was looking for. They have a lot of staff on deck and they are all nice people it's just not the job for me. They are very considerate.
good,It’s been a couple years since I’ve working at Lowe’s but I do remember the awesome people I’ve worked with in the warehouse. It’s been great being there and miss the people I’ve worked with
good,I absolutely loved my position as a Project Specialist-Interiors.  I was very disappointed that instead of fixing known problems they opted to eliminate the program altogether.  I expected more from a major corporation such as this....
good,"When we get there we had to use a pallet jack to get the merchandise for our aisles. We would help customers with their needs, if needed before the store closes. We would stock all items and clean up the store all night until the morning. We would also front face products on shelves, so that they were easily accessible for customers to grab off of the shelves."
good,Nothing to say. I would go back if managment listened to their people and really tried to make change. Company is wonderful. Not flexible with scheduling.
good,"Stay working hard and always busy with a task in need. A typical day at work were to work register, and if that wasn't needed, to stock household goods, move pallets."
good,Lowe's tries to create a family style culture.  Morning huddles to communicate company message.  Cook outs and team events.  They put a lot of effort to accommodate the employees but also ask just as much effort back.  Your co-workers are what really gets you through the days so come in with a positive attitude and you'll have a fun experience with Lowe's
good,Started as a temporary employee and received full time status. I was given a  $3 dollar per hr raise. At that time was told hrs being cut to 8 4hrs on Saturday 4hrs on Sunday. Not going to work for me
good,It was hard work and only got 3 hours a day so it wasn't worth it but the people were nice and the management team overall it was an alright expirence i just didnt get any hours
good,"Working in retail is never a blast, but the management was amazing overall with a few exceptions. Pay was good for the responsibilities with options to move around the store if desired"
good,"-Fast paced environment "
good,Good place to work. I typically drove fork lift picking product and loaded product. Responsible for keeping work area clean. Really liked co-workers and supervisor.
good,"I was seasonal. So the job security wasn’t there, benefits weren’t there, and the pay wasn’t there. They cut hours all the time for part timers and seasonal positions but if you’re full time, you’re safe. The management is horrible most of the time. Not all but most managers are not willing to help you. You basically have to figure things out on your own."
good,Working as a cashier for Lowe's can increase your experience with people and interactions. I learned how to be more patient with customers who may be having a bad day or just did not have a good experience. If you need more practice with multi-tasking I believe this job will help a lot.
good,"When I started working at Lowe's it used to be a lot fun but a lot of things have change a typical day starts with one hour of packing down fright just for one hour management is very micromanagement since we have to log in into every bay that we do so they can keep track of everything that we do, the hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress and the micromanagement at least for the store that I work at."
good,Lowes was a great place to work! I miss my coworkers! Lowes gave adequate training for the 2 positions I worked. They were great about giving our breaks and lunches! Gave you time to take your tests also. Great with my schedule! I would still be employed with them if they had given me full time!
good,"Customer satisfaction is a must.  Clean and friendly.   Price match other stores to make sure you get the best price.  Delivery and setup,  convenient online shopping"
good,"Learn alot at Lowe’s cause it was my first job when I moved to the United States, though it was a seasonal job but it was great working with the company...."
good,In receiving the job was limited to 3 work days a week which was good for my school schedule. They offered overtime if you were knowledgeable in certain areas.
good,"My location was a $70mil/year store so not the biggest but definitely saw a lot of traffic. Great starting pay and although raises aren't the best and are yearly, depending on your store you will have the ability to move up in position. I started as a regular Associate and within 3 months applied  to and got an opening as a Sales Specialist in the same department which provided a sizable increase in pay and another dimension to my job, which depending on your ability to multitask, may be great or a nightmare. "
good,Lowe’s is great place to work. They offer opportunities for advancement and ample amounts of training. Team building work environment for sure! I started from the bottom and was able to learn from my seniors the different dynamics of a minor company.
good,Great company to work would recommend for anyone. It is constantly growing and offers so many things to people. I loved the people and their ability to interact with customers
good,"Working at Lowes was great.  Nice pay, and great people to work with.  I would have stayed with them but I moved due to being in college.  But I would definitely work for them again."
good,My job at Lowe's was a good paying job but the work was really tough. Delivering refrigerator and other heavy items to split level houses was terrible
good,"Helping customers and taking care of the nursery flowers.  On a daily basis, help at a minimum of 100 customers.  Fill and stock shelves and maintain inventory."
good,"Very good employer as far as to retail goes, with above average pay for the industry and possibility of bonuses. Flexible work schedules and lots of opportunities to grow from within."
good,"Overall, Lowe's has been a great company to work for and has allowed me to obtain several different positions within the  infrastructure to build my resume and skill set."
good,"Great company to work for as long as you have an open schedule. "
good,I worked in the lawn and garden department so my only complaint would be the sun's heat. There were issues when schedule changes would happen and I'd stay over by accident often.
good,After you have worked there about a month you can see that the lenoir store is very dis functional. From management to policy many times you will be tied up waiting on a manager to help you. The higher up the chain in Lowe’s the harder it is to get help.
good,I enjoyed my many years working at lowe's. I learned so much that I still use daily. If there were better hours (day shift) i would probably have never left the company.
good,"YES - Tons of training for and on every way the store operates. For your job, safety, and practicing good customer services. I loved working there during the economy crash in 2011, ending my employment to relocate in 2014. Loved working with the customers, helping them with their home improvement project needs."
good,"Overall great teams members, very fast past, Customers need help and can make a difference in service there needs. Lost of changes over the last few years in structure but has great opportunity."
good,"Retail is a demanding environment, no matter what you're selling. With above-average pay and benefits Lowe's offers many opportunities for advancing one's skills and career. Many days are stressful but rewarding, as well."
good,I had the opportunity to really grow my career with Lowe’s. I’m happy for the experiences I gained and the people I worked with. Retail is demanding and the work employees do can be challenging.
good,Flooring Specialist is a physically demanding job.  Tile is not light and stocking takes physical fitness and technique or you will get injured.  People who work for Lowe's are a tight nit bunch.  Management at the time definitely cared about how you performed and how you were doing personally.
good,"The job started out as a full time temp job for the summer, of which turned out to me getting a part time offer when my temp position  was no longer applicable. The work environment was great but towards the winter months (December-January) part time employees hours were dropped to be around 10 per week, which was the main reason for me leaving the company."
good,Management well liked.  Lawn and garden beautiful department. Lowes  customer service for warranty is awesome. They have an associate discount.  Training is required.
good,Like most places people came and went. Sometimes very short handed. Most of the time it was a great place to work. Managers made sure you we properly trained. I wouldnt mind going back.
good,"Pay at Lowe's is barely sufficient to cover bills while working part-time."
good,Lowes management worked with you on what you needed. Concerned about is employees. Over all very nice company to work for pay rate alittle low. Most work was seasonally
good,Greeted and assisted customers.  Assisted with taking down and putting up store displays. Stocked merchandise and cleaned work areas. Answered customer calls and used store computer to look up store merchandise for customers.
good,"I would open and close so I pretty much Did it all. It was a very labor forced job, but that's what you expect for a home improvement store. Management was good for the most part except a couple of ASM's. The Culture at Lowes was good, a nice mix of people from all ages and backgrounds. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with heavy equipment when under stressful or bad weather conditions. Most enjoyable part was the flexibility of the job and the work environment."
good,"Lowe's is a place where their HR department is really strong, they will make sure that their employees are well taken cared of. Overall a good retail experience."
good,ringing up customers and cleaning up at the end of shift and providing assistance to anyone who needs help. the hardest part of the job is working in the garden center as youre in the weather no matter the conditions. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to actively learn new things and see customer projects come together.
good,"Most customers are easy to deal with.  I work to make their checkout experience simple, happy and delightful.  However, you never know what type of challenges may be presented.  Customers can occasionally be difficult, resolute and wanting to ""bend the rules.""  I first try to disarm customers like this with humor.  If that doesn't work, I try sympathy.  Sometimes, I need to be resolute... that they are asking me to break rules that simply can't be broken."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes in the electrical department which included contractor aisle for house construction, cut conduit for electrical jobs& lighting & fan fixtures and included accessories for light kits & fans."
good,Managers was okay. Work was good enjoyed making sales and assisting. The pay couldve been better as well as consistent shifts advancements. They give raises every 6 months. Coworkers were all good. Work from a temp to full-time. Normally worked all weekends had to enure i got at least one off a month.
good,"Great company. If you are going to work for a corporation, this is a good one to work with. The only people I hear complaining don't really know what else is out there. One valid complaint though - the pay is low for unskilled workers."
good,"Hours were never a set schedule, great staff to work with most of the time, it was busy but also not some days, pay was good but not enough to pay living expenses."
good,"Opening your register."
good,"A typical day for Lowe's, would include being a cashier for 5 hours, taking an hour break, and working another 4-5 hours. Lowe's was fun for me, sometimes it did get hard because customers could be a bit stressful and unkind, but you have to do your job the best you can and stay focused. Being patient and kind will get you very far with this job."
good,good place to work good pay and benefits good people safe place easy to get to health bus yearly breaks every 4 hours clean environment management easy to deal with
good,"Customer service, helping others. Management was often pulled in many directions. They were typically not helpful. Hardest part of the job was juggling multiple tasks at one time. Most enjoyable was giving customers your expert opinion on products."
good,It was very relaxed and a comfortable place to interact with customers daily. I learned a lot about the different plants and flowers. Meetings in the morning everyday.
good,"Not a stressful workplace, however they could staff more employees throughout the day. I loved helping the customers out. I loved working on the floor, but not the registers."
good,Changing culture. Great team to work with. Most enjoyable part id working in a matrix organizations that is very collaborative. Great on the job learning.
good,"Not a great top down management structure, company has always been top heavy on management and hasn’t been able to find the right balance to make it work."
good,"Competitive salary but has below average benefits. Culture is still a little old school but the new CEO is starting to change that perception. "
good,My job was to keep the parking lot clear from shopping carts plus help customers with heavy loads. And other duties like help customer service department with orders from the storage.
good,"The training was fantastic and the on the job even better. It was a complicated job there were expectations, but nothing that couldn't be achieved. The store manager that I had didn't relate well to employees and played favoritism."
good,"Most of the time you could have great time working, especially since they have a great team built (for the most part). Its a pretty fast paced place so you should be able to learn a lot in a short period of time. The management could differ in every store, I've had some great and not so great managers but for the most part I had good connection with them. The hardest part of the job is when you have to work in many different places because they are understaffed and didn't schedule enough people on busy days and didn't anticipate people calling out. The Most enjoyable part of the job was of course the food events haha, but your store would have to do good to receive those."
good,"I only worked at Lowe's at the very end of winter to prepare for the warm weather shoppers.  I stocked shelves before the store open, so I had to start work early (4 am). We usually finish our work before the end of the 8 hour shift."
good,Since Lowe's is a DIY store there are always chances to learn about different departments as well as expanding a person's own personal knowledge. It is definitely not the worst place to work.
good,i would say lowe's is overall a very good place to be employed. also most enjoyable is relating with customers in a positive way. well structured company.
good,"Over the past year I have been at Lowes I've learned how to enhance my customer service skills. When I first started with this company I did not know much about customer service, I am thankful that Lowes gave me an opportunity to gain those skills."
good,"Going through change is never easy, and we have gone through alot of change the last 4 years. Some is great, but some can be rough. Gotta power through it and see the positive it may bring"
good,"route planner"
good,Lowe's is a very nice place to work.  You can have good work/life balance.  The Managers and co-workers are very professional and friendly.  Good culture.
good,"Lowes was a fun place to work with great people. However, I worked there the summer between 12th grade and college first year. The schedule was so inconsistent it made having a personal life very difficult. Some days I would work the opening shift from 4:30 am to 12:30 pm and other days I would work closing shift from 4 pm to 12 pm."
good,"There was a good amount of down-time but when the customers came in it could get pretty hectic. There was always something to do though, so that was nice."
good,What do you expect? Every location is completely different in terms of management. I worked for 3 Lowes and they were all miles apart in terms of how much you wanted to work. Good managers=happy workers=happy customers.
good,Lowes was a good company but the people they had in charge was not qualified. Some didn’t know how to be leader or how to run a crew and some was still going through training. I went through the training  and everything and they still decided to hiring outside
good,Rare to see a fortune 500 company that cares to their employees as much as Lowe's does. I have friends that have been there forever because of how well they treat them.
good,"Some times 8 hours of deliveries, other days only 4 hours and some days can be 12+ hours. Managers are helpful and willing to work with you if you are courteous to them."
good,This is a good job that doesn't require much other than you performing the job well and in an efficient fashion. As long as you make the deliveries for the day you've done a good job.
good,overall a good experience. the hours can run long with up to eleven days straight without day off. management is not a Big Picture management team. would work there again.
good,It was good place to work. just a huge facility. walking many miles a night. It was nice and cool during the nights. lots of overtime for everyone .I would recommend the job to friends.
good,"As a operations level manager, your day starts at 4:30 am and typically ends at 5:00 pm. "
good,"Great place to work. The night shift is great, adjusting to the schedule isn't fun, though. Overall, its a great job with awesome perks and a great manager."
good,The people at Lowes were great.  I enjoyed working with most of them.  There were a few that made your work day less than pleasant. The work was relatively easy
good,"Great company to work for, surrounded with opportunities to grow and better yourself no matter what job you are in. Plenty of opportunities to succeed as well."
good,"Pay well, decent hours. Good retail chain if you want to spend time with the family at the holidays. Lots of change at the top has made employees confused about the security/direction of the company."
good,"I was always busy with customers and tasks, my days went by quickly. I met some interesting people that made each day as fun as we could together. I enjoy helping the customers."
good,"i have learned how to place orders for a s.o.s. item "
good,"I went to work there thinking it would be one of the last jobs i would ever have, that was not the case. I had the opportunity to be promoted, but the culture was heavy paced, with very few employees to complete the daily mission."
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for. Fellow employees are easy to get along with and work well together. Job is easy to keep if you're not looking for a challenge. Not a lot of chance for advancement it seems.
good,"Extremely busy workplace in season, depends heavily on teamwork in order to meet the customer's needs, much less stressful in the off season when there's time to prepare for spring/summer again"
good,"Lowe's has many great opportunities and it teaches you so many things from working hard to learning how to work with different systems. As well providing exceptional customer service to every single person, and learning to deal with conflict between customers and employees. Although, there can once in a while be favoritism and it causes conflict between certain employees at time, but it can always be worked out."
good,"Its retail, so high stress and fast paced environment. Management can be both good and bad at the same time. Opportunities for store achievement and reward. Little for employee advancement, either go management or stay as an hourly. Great learning environment."
good,"i enjoyed learning different roles here, there is several positions on the sales floor that take skill and must be knowledgeable to customers. advancement is more difficult."
good,"Want to work a job that you can learn allot, work allot, but have to wait for years to get promoted? Want to work for a place that acknowledges your effort, but doesn't recognize it with pay?"
good,"My typical day at Lowe's would be working front-end. (ex: cashier,customer service,returns, online as well as in-store orders)"
good,I have worked in the concord mills store the store is very clean and usually busy. can be painful on your body to lift and move things and the men do not offer to help
good,I started out in delivery but after an injury I was moved to the registers as a cashier. I enjoyed working with customers and quickly found a home. Like in any job Lowes is not perfect but with a good attitude I enjoyed most of my time there.
good,"When changes in the company are made to make the workload ""easier"" it tends to not apply to us and most of the time increases our workload. There is no feeling of respect for the amount of work the crew does."
good,Our Lowe's Store is one of the very best in the state.  We have a great company culture and there are alot of opportunities to get to work for decent pay.  The only reason I left is because I couldn't get full-time hours.
good,"When I was at Lowe's, I enjoyed most parts of my job. When my new manager come on, things changed a bit. After being in position about two years, one Friday morning I learned my position was eliminated. There is no job security with Lowe's career-wise, but they were good to me when I was hired there in college."
good,"Has Great Benefits "
good,A good place to work with decent compensation and benefits. The management is driven by sales volume goals and everything in the store works around that.
good,"The old management style Lowes had was horrible , the main reason they lagged behind Home Depot and never was a threat but now the company is being run by high Home depot former executives and are turning the company into the right direction."
good,"good place to work, good people"
good,Lowe’s is a pretty good place to start off at. The work is somewhat fair but none of the work is incapable of being done. And the foot flow from customers are kinda slow so overall it’s pretty laid back
good,Fast paced environment with lots of moving parts.  No two days were ever the same.  Always had to be on your toes and expect the unexpected.  Great place to learn about distribution.
good,"Your first and foremost responsibility is to assist customers by answering their questions regarding products and help them with the purchase of said products.  If the product was not in store, we assisted them in ordering online.  Their were specific times assigned when you restocked shelves with returned items and new products, straightened shelves, and cleaned your signed area."
good,Decent Workplace overall. Decent hours as well. Potential to make advancements through departments and positions. Some of the younger associates are a pain to work with but not a deal-breaker.
good,"Good Staff -  Management ...meh - HR non exist - Good Company"
good,Lowe's is one of the most pleasant retail companies to work for in my opinion. Managers are usually friendly and not too strict with the store associates compared to their competitor's store such as Home depot.
good,Lowe's is a very friendly and close knit place to work. Co-workers seem almost like a big family. The only downside to working at Lowe's is it's very hard to move up from a part-time position to full-time. Part-time workers are offered no benefits and inconsistent hours during the winter months.
good,productive and enjoyed family of co workers a typical day was put up freight zone downstock zone and clean department i learned to zone downstock and do cyclecounts  work place culture was enjoyable great coworkers rekeying locks taking care of customers i really enjoyed working in tools and hardware leatned alot about tools and door hardware  really enjoyed working with the department manager until lowes did away with department managers
good,I learned a lot about household repairs a lot of times I had to pretty much run the whole store by myself I very seldom got help from the upper management it was great when we started out and we only worked one Department then they switched it and we was now over three different departments that made it a little bit more stressful
good,Hard work I would always leave really dirty and sweaty but it made me feel like I had earned my paycheck. The receiving department was a very cooperation based department.
good,"most positions have little room for advancement, but it's a job.  Pay rate was not very good, and there was a high turnover rate of staff, making consistency difficult"
good,"I enjoyed working there, their just wasn't a lot of room to grow in the company. They also higher out of the company and then fire them at the end of the season."
good,Lowe's is an okay place to work if you enjoy sucking it up and working in retail. I would suggest this job for a younger or single crowd that does not have children because of the hours.
good,"I worked in the delivery department for 3.5 years and there has been a lot of ups and downs. The pay can be good if you are willing to take on extra responsibilities or will to work extreme hours in adverse conditions. Very often I worked 12-13 hours long days, and did this for days in a row. You take your lunch on the road if you have time and the job is always throwing curve balls and surprises at you during the fast paced work day. The customers can be the best and the worst part about the job, working with all sorts of people and environments. This included working in million dollar homes and high expectations, and working and dilapidated residences of the worst kind. You get to know the people you work with very well as you bleed, sweat and lift the heaviest objects together. Each day is always different and has its own challenges and rewards. Overall my experience as an employee was not the best, but my experience as the customer has been amazing."
good,I enjoyed the hours at Lowe's however it was not a flexible job for me. I need some stability in my home due to me having younger children and this job did not offer that. It is a great place to work for someone who have no other obligations.
good,Good place to work. management treated me fairly. learned about customer service in a high volume retail environment. A typical day includes inventory replenish and area upkeep
good,Decent place to work and to try and advance in the company. The always changing landscape is to be taken with caution. Management is always an open door.
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowes. Lowes will  do everything in their power to satisfy the client. Lowes has nice selection for home improvement projects .Lowes has associates that are very professional,"
good,"Unloading associate. Trained on forklift to help unload merchandise for the store. Quick, fast paced work environment. Great for an entry level position"
good,"Negative:"
good,"keeping product filled, the department cleaned, and customers happy and informed with answering their questions, Helping people solve problems is one of the best parts of the job"
good,"Great Company, had a great time working there. Co-workers and management were down to earth folks, and easy to get along with. Depending in which department you work there are physical requirements that can seem daunting, but you usually always have a team member there to help."
good,"Worked with awesome people, the job was busy and the day flew by. The management had some issues but overall was great. I loved working for this company and if they paid more then I would still be there!!"
good,Can advance quick as long as work hard. Discounts are great but jumping different shifts make it hard to keep personal live in check. They often also delete positions and layoff
good,"its a good place to work the discounts are good as well."
good,Good place to work. People are very helpful at times. Management is okay depends on what shift you are on. Co-workers are great to work with and fun..
good,"Management could be better overall, there's a need for more detailed oriented individuals. There are programs and opportunity for those who want to do more with their lives."
good,This is a company with a lot of nice things for the employees such as fun cook off parties and celebrations for milestones in safety and things like that but the opportunity to advance in some positions is none. They hire for upper management outside of the company and that makes it hard for people who have been with the company to advance. If there is no set availability then the hours are all over the place and they don't communicate schedule changes with you.
good,"I've worked for this company 11 years, at three different locations. We're often understaffed and corporate makes some odd decisions that aren't in the best interest of their people, because they only have the business in mind. "
good,"They tell you from the beginning that it is a fast paced work environment, so if you're not willing or able to work like that then it's on you. People were nice as well as your superiors."
good,"Lowes has to much irregular hour close one night at 10 then open the next morning at 6am. never the same days off, hard to make appointments. Lack of a steady pay check."
good,"We assist customers in our department, an entire store."
good,Low family life long hours.  Every changing.  Can not make up their mind on what they what to be as a company.  Very big on flavor of the month and following HD
good,"I worked in the paint department at my Lowe's and it was one of my favorite and easy to learn areas of work to date. Customers are most likely not to be quick to anger or frustration and impatience while shopping for fun colors and great quality paint. "
good,"its okay but no organization, the management team need much improvement and could use more training. They allow you to grow. within the company and have many great benefits."
good,Worked diligently with coworkers. I really enjoyed working for this company. Was kept busy all day with IRPs and mixing paint for loyal customers. Would work here again if I was given the chance.
good,"The job itself was, as expected, dull and unrewarding. What made this place so wonderful was it's staff. There was a melting pot of people from all walks of life. Everyone had a different and unique story. They were welcoming, understanding, and a fun bunch. Management and HR were close to awful but kept it professional at least. When I left they had just hired a new head cashier that was detrimental to everyone's success and satisfaction with their job. Many people left after that person come aboard. I left due to relocating, but I would have left anyway because of the new flood of management they were implementing. I miss working there when it was good. "
good,"gotta be on your best behavior when working here, the job is really tough, gotta be quick on feet, know what the customer needs and restock your whole department"
good,I love working for Lowes. I receive great discounts and most of the people I work with are fun. The benefits are really great. Management is pretty good. The store manager has high expectations and she is very supportive.
good,This is pretty much your average retail position. It is sufficient while attending college. There is some room for growth depending on your store location.
good,"For the most part Lowes is a great company to work for, however expectations are different from market to market. They have great benefits. Management work long hours."
good,"Great place to work, management quality varies. Very fast paced. Corporate decisions sometimes don’t make sense. Staff has fun and mostly enjoys being there."
good,"The hardest part was having to adjust to fellow worker opinion while giving the respect I hoped to receive. However, the best part is the privilege to assist the people that needed assistance as the customers who spent their hard earned money on products and aimed to use those products for home and Business life."
good,"A typical day at work just involves customer service, stocking, and putting freight away.  The hardest part of the job is working on a concrete floor 8 hours a day; its very hard on the legs and feet!  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people.  Lowe's provided me with a job while I pursued my education, which was wonderful!"
good,A typical day at work is normally busy and fast paced. What I had learned during the time that I had worked there was the running of a register and the way a hardware works. The management was very understandable and out going. The hardest part of the job are going and getting the labels correct on any wood products. The most enjoyable part was working in the garden center.
good,"When i started there, my only plumbing knowledge was in taking HVAC At my vocation high school, so pretty limited, but i actually learned a lot there, from other coworkers, customer, and familiarizing myself with product.  If you'd like a permanent job here however, having a knowledge of your department will help."
good,"I have there for two months now and even though things get a little chaotic sometimes, I like my co-workers and it is a good place to work especially being a delivery driver."
good,"Showing up to work and clocking in and getting to the work area. communicating with the employes and customers on the regular basis. the hardest part of the job would be, being short staffed and being busy. But overall the job wasn't too hard at all. I enjoyed working with the employees that I worked with an the environment was great."
good,Its a good start. They have helped me grows in my ability to work and understanding. They have tought me and see a better person in my career in any job.
good,Depending on which location you work at this company can be  good and bad. I learned alot about sales working for Lowe's years ago. Promotions come from within which is a big plus.
good,Lowes was a busy place a call center for major appliance repair calls. Manager was great and very helpful and accomodating with all of his team. Team mates were great.
good,I worked at Lowe's on the weekends and summers through high school. Wages were competitive and the difficulty of work was low. Lowe's was a great place to earn some experience in the work force.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work. Unfortunately I was caught in the restructure and my position was eliminated. If that did not happen, I would have stayed with Lowes for a long time."
good,"As a independent, the hours could be great or arduous just depends upon the job.  Some jobs were quick and home by noon, while others required 2 days to complete."
good,"Great work environment where you can meet and help others. Fast-paced with friendly employees. Hard work, yet fun. "
good,Great place to work good pay and great benefits one of my favorite jobs. Raises were good if I could work here again I would probably really enjoy it.
good,I have worked for better low paying jobs that treat u better and take in consideration  that u have a life other then them and all around treats u like a person
good,"Over the years I have worked at Lowes there have been a lot of changes, some good and some bad. There are still some changes coming.  Overall, it is a good company to work for."
good,"Working here is quite enjoyable. Overall, the management staff are very good to work with. They are very accommodating when it comes to family occurrences. Love the customers. Customers really appreciate an associate who knows their stuff and helps them complete a project for their home with confidence. Some days are busier than others, but you can always find something constructive to do on a slow day."
good,"While the management as a whole was less than stellar, the benefits earned were worth the lack of structured management. I loved my job, however, I was unable to return to the position following Cervical Spine Surgery. My position was filled before I recovered enough to return. A typical day required resetting bays inside and outside the store. Resetting involved lifting heavy product and hardware. My schedule was generally day shift from 7:30am to 3:00pm with a one hour lunch break. When I traveled to different stores within the district, I also worked overnights and worked overtime many weeks. Many associates were jealous of us because we didn't have to deal with the same types of problems as they did. I learned to perform maintenance and frequently built structures and made repairs while resetting the product. The hardest part of the job would have to be performing the job with poor management. Many times, we felt like we either had no support from management or we would be overly managed to the point where we had no flexibility in our work. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was when we completed cleaning and resetting. I loved seeing the completed work and having workers compliment us on a well done job."
good,Worked there for 13 years. Gave all my heart and soul. Would do anything they asked of me. But management change and things changed for the worst. They start not to care for employees. And it became to cliche among the new managers. They started getting rid of long term employees.
good,I loved working for lowes until the restructure took place.They need more knowledgeable people and better managers.  Better job advancement and better training to help employees succeed in their department.
good,"I was looking for another job, but Lowe's hired me and I worked here until I found a different job. I started out seasonal and full time and went part time when the holidays were over."
good,"I loved working for this company. I could choose my own hours and had the weekends off. I learned how to mix paint and how to make keys."
good,"Fun Place to work. They have great benefits. The people there are pretty good, but I have found that their customer service has gone down slightly since I was there years ago."
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for if you love the customer service field."
good,Lowe's provides great progression from entry level to management.  I enjoyed the fast pace and the carreer growth the Company provided.  Unfortunately the are centralizing the HR function at the Corporate level.
good,As a contractor and during a short period of time it is very difficult to accurately state a review for a big corporation as lowe's . close management is very present and helpful
good,"I was only a seasonal employee, but it was a nice work environment. The people in charge of you were kind, but also helped you achieve your work goals."
good,The schedule was changed with out warning understaffed and lack of hours but the job was fun mixing paint learning how to do different things was very cool
good,"it is a beginner job while you work there search for a career."
good,"its a good first job.Great customers, and fast paced. They work with you as much as they possibly can. Good management. Discounts are great, as a part time that about all you get."
good,Its not a bad company to work for overall. Some people/management are better than others. It just depends on your personality about who you'll get along with and who you won't.
good,"A typical workday for me would be to check e-mails for information on company sales and product information as well as appointments that were scheduled online.  Customers can request an appointment for a quote on roofing, fencing, windows, doors, etc. online.  I would also work in our company software to schedule and confirm appointments that were requested by customers through our store associates.  I would complete sales paperwork and follow up with customers that have already had an appointment and have a quote on the project they would like to have done.  I Like the job very much.  I like to interact with the customers and have a very good working relationship with other associates.  I would not consider leaving, but my hours have continually been cut from 20 hours per week to 12 hours per week.  The culture changes at this time of year due to other associates hours being cut. This has created a large turnover which is understandable when salaries are reduced due to the hourly cut back.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with our customers."
good,"Customer Service Associate, Front end work, team member ."
good,"Have not been in touch."
good,Hardest part of the job that is stressful is having to tell a customer that the product is still not here when they have been waiting two weeks for...
good,"I love Lowe's but where I am at now I do not have good hours and get thrown all over the place with scheduling. Management does not hold anyone accountable anymore or make anyone do their jobs. I want to work at a place where I know people are going to do their jobs, I want more learning experience besides being in retail and I want a better work schedule"
good,Lowes hires seasonal starting early spring. if you do good enough at your job you can become full time associate. indoor lawn and garden is not easy work
good,"Years ago the company was strong and cared for its people. Now since there is a new CEO finally at the helm, perhaps that will change and their associates will finally feel like they are worth something."
good,"Have made many advancements while working here. The management is supportive, however staffing can be an issue.  Ability to learn many different departments.  Have obtained three different power equipment licenses.  Given a high level of respect.  Managers listen and take into consideration your concerns."
good,"I am a highly driven employee that is a bit out of place in a retail environment where most are just putting in hours. I take missing targets in the Pro department and at times tried to inspire and motivate my teammates with some level of success. I carry the department, however, individual sales are not commissioned based on departments but more on the overall store. This form tends to stifle those who over achieve at their jobs. I like Lowes but at our store we currently have many managers that are good workers lack key managerial skills in order to hold  others accountable, train others under them and organize staff."
good,"This was a very structured place with decent benefits.  The pay was not the best.  Most of the people that worked there were enjoyable to be around and there were some very good managers."
good,"Great people, great management."
good,honorable company going thru change that a new CEO brings. Seen lots of turnover in Store Manager positions. Complex systems need to be updated. Pursuit of competitors leading to marginal employee coverage.
good,"I have been with Lowes for one year and I have enjoyed the company and serving there customers even though management could have been better, I love that them."
good,great company that gave me some work experience but it's difficult to apply for another job within the company..  I was given the opportunity to brush up on my customer service skills
good,I worked at lowes in hopes of getting hired full-time but they only hire people for seasonal work. The management didn't care about the employees like most major companies.
good,Was not the best job. I had some issues with one of the managers that always wanted to send me out for deliveries although that was not my job. Even to the point where he wanted to fire me for not doing someone else’s job when I had a lot to do.
good,the people are great and its the meeting of new customers daily that gets the day going. Over all there isn't much advancement in the company. Id still recommend this place to any one because of the environment... This is a place where you can come in and meet new people daily .If you are willing to learn new things this is  the place to work.
good,I liked the job position I had in North Carolina it was internet fulfillment and the work was easy and laid back it had it's days when it was busy and hard work but other than that the job was more easy than hard.
good,It was a enjoyable and learning filled three months. Although the department I worked in was always in high demand especially during the summer months.
good,Working as a cashier can be difficult. Alot of drama and cattiness amongst the cashiers. Company itself is flexible and work around your school schedule.
good,"The company is honorable. I love the red, white and blue connotations toward our country. There respect for veterans made me proud.  The hardest part of the job was satisfying the management and their unrealistic budget demands. There demands were company driven, not customer driven."
good,Lowe's can be a great place to work.  The upper management in the store makes the difference.  When the upper management is fair and cognizant of what is happening in the store everything runs smoothly.  When the upper management is on a power trip the work environment is dog eat dog.
good,The Pay and hours not the best but the work place is relax and stress less ... for the 2nd time in my 20 years work life I can’t wait to go to work.. I enjoy it!
good,productive place to work  not a place to advance at a fast pace very routine work and not alot of opportunity for advancement and or pay increase over all a good place to work
good,The staff was friendly. The store was clean and efficient. There were online learning modules to help employees learn about the policies and procedures.
good,Lowes was a good place to work sometimes but it was very unorganized also with the workers. Workers were mostly late for their shift meaning the people that was already at work had to stay longer.
good,Lowe's is in a transition period with a new CEO in place. I feel I have had the opportunity grow with Lowe's throughout my career. The pay is good for retail but alot is expected from you.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work, they have a phenomenal campus with eat-in facilities for lunch and breakfast.  The new CEO has taken initiatives to include the employees in on future plans."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's as a temp, being hired on at Lowe's had benefits and a good opportunity with pay raises. Not climate controlled but it is a warehouse. Roughly a few hundred thousand square foot warehouse, had opportunities to get fork lift licenses etc."
good,"Lots of room to climb in the company, Good wages, and great benefits. Hours are nice, and the environment in pretty relaxed for how big the stores are"
good,"it was a nice environment to be in, some days it’s was a overwhelming place to be only because of the emotions of others but overall it’s an amazing company"
good,A typical day was stocking the lumber area. Iearned  to operate forklifts  orderpickers and reachtrucks. management was strick. the hardest part was the lifting.
good,"Started off early in the mourning opening up appliances setting up fliers and new price tags then go check in with other department to see if they need help. I learned how to set up deliveries and sales for clients buying appliances. Management was great to work, the work environment was slow but very competitive in sales. The hardest part was the pay and the easiest part was the relaxing tone that was set. It made selling items smooth."
good,good place to work for a retail store. got to meet new people. was able to advance if you wanted to. …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
good,"Co workers where fun and benefits where good.  All other aspects of the job was average.  Schedule was accommodating, Monday though Friday 8+ hour shifts."
good,"Lowe’s is an ok place to work,they have good Benefits, cool people that work there, and management often feeds us, and host events for families. And the pay is good."
good,The managers at Lowe's are great they truly care about you. You could always go to them and talk to them if you need something and they act as motivators for advancement.
good,it was okay on the days i was off and would try to work they wouldnt ever let me come in i would always try to come in and work more hours when they were low on staff
good,being in retail there is a different outlook on customer service. The workplace is very diversified and the hard part of the job is standing for long periods of time.
good,"Currently Lowes is a decent place to work. As with every job, there is the usual gossip and conflict between certain personalities that tend to clash.  The customers are typical for the local area and the employees are typically friendly. It's been a great experience thus far."
good,"This was my first job, and it provided me a lot of great experience. It allowed me to engage with all kinds of people, learn how to operate a register and count back large amounts of cash, and to provide great customer service. There is only one problem, which is why I want to leave.... If you know nothing about hardware, lumber, or garden, this is NOT the place for you. As a cashier, I’m expected to know these things without any training whatsoever. Most of the time I would learn something by first making a mistake then being corrected for it. The training is poor because it does not help me be prepared for an environment where I need to know what everything is and have no prior knowledge of it. However, managers and coworkers are very nice and while it’s still a retail job, overall customers are very nice as well."
good,"Fun place to work and make friends.  Although it can get cliquey (sp?)"
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes very much.  Everyone pulled their own weight and collaborated to get things done.  The head cashiers/managers were friendly to work with, and fair with criticisms.  The only complaint I had was that the schedule was never consistent, and often mismanaged."
good,"I learned a lot working for Lowes. I learned how to use power tools and power equipment. I learned many aspects of how fixtures would be installed in a persons home. There was a serious lack of communication between the corporate offices and the individual stores along with a lack of communication between store management and store associates. Workplace culture lacked because of this issue resulting in associates becoming lazy with minor accountability to be found, for example. The most difficult part of the job was the lack of communication which turned into confusion and frustration. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find solutions to problems with their projects and seeing the aisles go from unorganized and chaotic to clean, organized and shoppable."
good,"I was employed with Lowe's for 10 1/2 years. I enjoyed my time while I was working there. I have experience in several departments of the store. If it wasn't for my medical issues, I believe that I would have still been employed there."
good,"They terminate the people who actually does their jobs and keep the people who stands around joking and laughing."
good,It was a pretty good place to work.  decent pay for what they ask you to do.  You get health benefits and vacation and holiday pay after a year.  Decent raises
good,"I have worked for 2 of the big box retailers and in alot of ways they are similar. However I feel like Lowe's "
good,"Working at Lowe's was a fun place to work. For what i was doing a Seasonal Cashier the pay wasn't horrible, the schedule was flexible. Managers were understanding an most of the time could help if needed but rarely were truly able too."
good,I generally enjoyed my job and would recommend it to friends and family. You get to make small talk with the clientele and pick up some social skills that helped me.
good,"The team at the store I worked at was fantastic, though I disagreed with most of the things the higher ups (Corporate) were doing. It was a fun place to work."
good,"While working at Lowes, I had the pleasure of helping customers, both DIY and contractors. I enjoyed helping customers put their ideas into reality with the correct supplies and guidance."
good,Lowe's is a company that always short staffed. You have several duties to perform. Your title may be manager but you work on the floor to assist with customer service just like everyone else. I loved this job because it taught me many things.
good,The job was easy and they trained very well. If you are a cashier you do get moved around a lot. It was a more laid back job. The store manger is good.
good,Lowe's had a lot of amazing benefits for employees. The amount of maternity leave and the corporate rotation schedules were enticing. This company cares about their employees.
good,Great place to work if you like being constantly busy working. It takes great time management to work there and patience as well. You will use heavier machinery as well.
good,"It was sometimes an unpredictable day at work. Depending on the shift manager in charge. It could be very enjoyable during a shift or it could be very demanding. I really enjoyed working in the garden area, until I needed someone from management."
good,"Lowes was your typical retail job, it had its fair share of frustrations and feelings of under compensation. However, Lowes, as a company, is generally well ran and I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Pay and benefits are fair for the jobs offered, but do to the usual corporate baloney there is a real lack of good management. This has led to a sharp decline in overall work place satisfaction. Corporate has made it clear that the bottom line is more important than the employees. Sadly management also has done little to look after their employees either, always putting the customer first. Often resulting in unnecessarily long/hard days at work. There are some few good managers still around, who will make working here great, but those do so by taking the burden upon themselves and often do not last long."
good,liked working at lowes pay was ok and the people was fun to work with asms sent me home for a hole in the lower part of my pants and ws told i did not need the job
good,"When i got hired on, People were really nice working with and the work was easy and understanding, i learned everything quick, i got taught alot of work i didnt know how to do due to this being my first job, i had fun."
good,"Lowes is a great job if you are looking for an additional part time job, are a young student, or would like to work full time. While some customers can be challenging the store is a  great place to work and most customers are great."
good,"Customers can be the worst aspect of this job. They assume you should be a know it all of all trades and get mad when you tell them you have no experience in construction, electrical, or plumbing or whatever it may be. I was a cashier for the lumber dept. was frequently asked for what type of concrete should they use for so and so and what deck design suits best for their house. Listen, i’m just as clueless as you are on stuff like that. I’m just the cashier."
good,Only objection was having to work almost every weekend nights I have rarely had a weekend off mostly schedule for night work even though there would be days more early morning hours that I would’ve preferred it times that would be available
good,Lowes was a good career I enjoyed working with the company we would go to customer house and lay down tile flooring as well as laminate wood flooring and stripping the floors of old flooring.
good,"They pay well and speak of how much they value you as an employee, but when I requested to apply for a promotion, it was denied due to my short time on the job despite my years of experience working and leadership/management experience."
good,"Did overnight receiving. Work can be labor intensive at times, but most of it was rather relaxed. May have been my favorite job thus far. Honestly, if I could make more money doing that, I would have never left."
good,"I feel Lowes is not that bad of a place to work. I think that certain positions need to be reviewed better especially at my location. My biggest thing about wanting to leave is that I have been locked in at a certain pay rate for the last 5 years. I believe this to be unfair while others do not generate the sales that I have generated at my location and they have the title and the money. "
good,Lowes is a great place to work if you enjoy retail. They pay more than Walmart. They train you very well in safety. I've never had an issue with management.
good,"They’re okay. Just no room for your life here, and forget if you have kids! Ha"
good,working in the environment of Lowes is very normal and flexible they don't rush you that much. people at Lowes are friendly but sometimes people  want to know your personal life which I don't like. I don't think there is a places as comfortable as Lowes. the good think about management is that they give you opportunity to grow. but sometimes they don't even know what they do
good,"I liked working there and the management. I regret that I made the dumb mistake that I did that caused me to lose my job there. The majority of managers at Fairbanks, AK Lowes were approachable and happy to help, teach, and train you up in the best way possible."
good,At this job the other employees are friendly and very informative. As with any retail position the greatest difficulty is in dealing with customers. All in all it was a good experience.
good,I worked there for a summer. It was a nice summer job just thought it would be a little longer. It was hot out side but they always had ice water for us.
good,working at Lowes wasn't bad but it wasn't like it was the best thing in the world. but they pay well and the work isn't too hard as long as you keep up with it. overall it's a good place to start from and get a foot in the door for the future.
good,Worth the money just wish more hours. Less micro management.the the experience is worthwhile.me cool people all the time. I would recommend it because it will get better.
good,"I was fresh out of high school, first job. I steady and content work was okay just didnt offer the benfits and carrer advance that I was seaching back then."
good,"It is a decent company to work for and it has served me well for over 13 years.  I would say if anything can be improved upon it's the willingness to change from a management level.  If a program does not work, fix it immediately instead of waiting until it is not salvageable and starting over."
good,"It would all start off with us meeting at the warehouse, we'd get our customer sheets, go pick up the supplies from the local Lowe's, and then get to work upon arrival."
good,"From the first day not much guidance from management. Coworkers gave advice if they felt like it. Helps to be a quick learner. Store is dirty - mice run rampant inside and outside, especially at opening and closing times."
good,"The focus at Lowes is on customer service. The goal is to help people ""love where they live"". Currently, Internet Sales are being added to the services offered. Lowes has merchandise in Indoor/Outdoor Lawn and Garden, Plumbing, Electrical, Appliances, Lumber, Storage, Flooring, Interior Decor, Doors & Windows, and Tools. "
good,its easy to learn everything there is to know and not a bad part time job. I work in sales and so its a little different than most departments because people mostly go there for hardware or building materials. nun the less I know a lot about the rest of the store just listening to other associates explain things to customers. its a fun and great work environment but im just looking to take the next step and move up somewhere else.
good,"I worked in the deli preparing various prepared meats, cheeses, and pasta dishes. We cut and weighed a large variety of deli meats to meet the customers needs."
good,"A slow pace job that is perfect for a person to get involved with people on the projects on a daily "
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for that strives to help customers love where they live. They company continues to go through changes trying to stay up with market trends.
good,"The job did not pay great and i did not receive a lot of experience in any certain field, but the job came at a time where i needed it the most.  I was in school, trying to get married.  The company worked hard on allowing me the opportunity to work as much as i could given my schedule.  I was in school all day so they set me up with the night shift each day i was scheduled, then allowed me to work days on the weekend for a break."
good,Great job for in between moments in your career. It is a great place to work in the meantime. The culture at the store depends on the community the store is in.
good,"meeting new people is always a plus and learning how to operate different machinery, learning how to do projects was the high light of my job.  Just like in every establishment you have some managers that are awesome and some not so awesome.  The pay wasn't all that but it helped"
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working there part time.  The coworkers were generally nice, but like any job, there may be one or two flaky coworkers that try to make everyone miserable.  Key is to ignore those negative coworkers and report them to HR any verbal harassment or mental abuse.  The pay was reasonable and it's truly a huge plus that Lowe's offer health, dental and 401K benefits to part timers. Most companies don't offer little to no benefits for part timers.  So I have to say they get an A++ for their benefits.  If you can focus on learning your job, do it well, and go to work everyday with a positive mindset without expecting appreciation from management and not expecting to be best friends with management and/or coworkers, then you'll be fine.  I worked there three years to just bring in extra income for a while and left only because I found a full-time position with greater pay.  On my last day there, not one manager came by to say good bye and thank me for the three years of service I put in.  I was also one of the few employees that were cross trained and took pride in a doing a job exceedingly well.  No hard feelings though because the pay, benefits, and job security outweighed the negatives."
good,"Good solid company. I have wrote alot of negative. I do have some postive at bottom."
good,"Really nice to have first grabs on makes down products an a pretty friendly work environment but when it comes to advancement an growth that’s an negative, pay is an negative also includes raises"
good,There was always something to do. There will honestly probably never be a time where you aren’t doing anything which is not bad at all. If your looking for a place to stay busy and going this is it.
good,"Lowe's is a hard place to work for. People are quitting faster than they can hire and having limited staff can be very complicated. I have made a lot of new friends there and everyone is nice. Being in retail, you will always get fustrating and difficult customers. The manage isn't the best as they don't always see the biggest problems."
good,Driving heavy machines to put stock up on the perm racks for inventory. I learned how important safety plays a role in our day to day life by inspecting equipment before usage. Work place and management are awesome.
good,"Enjoyable place to work, productive employees for the most part although the hours were absolutely horrendous."
good,You get to meet all kinds of people. You learn a lot of the contractors in the town.You get to learn a lot of interesting projects and learn a lot about different products.
good,So much turnover driven by former GE leadership.  Not sure how Lowe's expects management from unsuccessful GE (Recently removed from DJI) to bring success to Lowe's.  I'm really hoping that the new CEO can pump some stability back into a great retail organization.
good,Some place to work good opportunities. Good   Employees could have better work balance Some days can be difficult while others are a lot of fun Good benefits
good,"I enjoy working here but I need more money, I need more money to be able to get back up on my feet by myself. Money, hours and coworkers are great. Just my personal things going on"
good,"A typical night at Lowes is that all of the workers gather around for a huddle in the receiving bay. To discuss the merchandise that we have to stock and who is doing what departments for the night. Once we have finished our respective departments then we are expected to help other departments that still has a lot of merchandise to stock. After our first break time, we start by cleaning up the store and putting extra merchandise with the help of power machines to put them on the top shelf. "
good,good first job. a lot of room to move up in the company if I could go back I would I started off as a cashier and became a customer service leader worked there for 5 years
good,"They have great benefits whether part time or full time. It is a rewarding company. They have customer service awards, promotion options, and training for a job you want."
good,I enjoyed working there but had to leave for school purposes. Everyone was friendly and very helping. It's a lot to learn but once you get it you'll be just fine.
good,"start of the day is pretty easy which turns hectic as the shift about to end due to task needs to be completed no matter how busy you get."
good,Well I would start my shift by walking into lowes at 5:00am and head towards the back of the store for receiving/stocking. After I sent out the deliveries for the day I would be done at 9am or 10am then get delivery ready for next day and stock shelves until 2:30
good,"Day to day was pretty relaxed in my department. Getting your stuff done was a requirement daily, and we had no problem doing that. The management at the store was pretty rough and self absorbed though."
good,"Came in every day with little supervision left to do my job. Good atmosphere and people. Work repetitive, help customers and move carts. Little interaction with management."
good,A typical day at work involved start of shift meeting. Driving a forklift and putting product in designated places. There was never a dull moment because I performed multiple tasks throughout my work night.
good,"Lowe's is a very good choice for a person's full job. It is a simple workplace with many potential roles to fill. However, I would not recommend planning to stay there permanently, as most will not get a full-time job immediately. Many of my co-workers have openly stated that they worked there for years before full-time opportunities arose."
good,Working at Lowes is great. The hours are nice as well. The work environment is fast paced and sometimes very stressful. Closing shift is probably the hardest since you are usually scheduled by yourself.
good,"Not a bad place to work, sometimes very hectic and confusing. Electronic/software systems are outdated and unusable. Most managers are just supervisors and know nothing of motivating their employees."
good,"Good place to be, down to earth busy environment there is a lot of experience to gain and a lot of knowledge available to gain at lowes as well. Lowes is also a family like environment."
good,Positive work environment.  I work part time and my manager works with me to create the best fit for my availability and Lowe's needs.  Good team environment.
good,"I took this job because I thought I would be working with plants.  At  first I was, but then I was told that I was not to touch a plant unless I was specifically asked to by the management. Instead, I was to stock plant chemicals and load mulch into the customer's vehicles.  When closing I would sweep or use a blower to clean the floor in the garden center."
good,"Good Place Provide fast, friendly service."
good,"The pay was pretty decent for the work. It was a weekend position, so sometimes it would get fairly busy. It was never an overburdening job. I would recommend it."
good,At Lowe's you have the benefit of working for a large Fortune 500 hardware chain of retail stores. There are many options for promotion. Salary is good for retail chain.
good,Lowe's was a great company to work for. They allowed flexible hours for part time workers who were either going to school or working multiple jobs. The best part about working at Lowe's was the employees.
good,"Lowe's is one big family, when you join the team you will be a part of it for life. Everyone does there best to create team work to help improve the customers experience."
good,Working for Lowes was great. But the management never gave compliments when they were deserved. It was sales and every day you start over again at zero. Compliments go a long way!!!
good,"I enjoy working at Lowe's its a family friendly environment. aside of some rude customers, there are many whom are pleasant. overall my coworkers and mangers make my our work place enjoyable."
good,"The employees and management were helpful and friendly, and the customers were good too. Standing all day with little movement was the hardest part, my legs were in a lot of pain and we couldn't sit down. I was paid almost 1 dollar less an hour than I was told I would be on the hiring website. I took it up with HR but nothing changed. It was a miscommunication with the website and whoever decides the salary."
good,"There are many different jobs at the Lowe's Distribution center, ranging from loading and unloading semis to driving various pieces of equipment, preforming various tasks."
good,"For a part-time job, Lowe's was an exceptional workplace.  Flexible schedules and there was always plenty to learn on the job.  Pay was decent with fair wage increases."
good,"Overall fun place to work,if you are people person like my self.My goal was to make customers happy,that made my day.Ability to maintain a high level of professionalism,patience and efficiency to minimize customer  dissatisfaction and increase customer loyalty.This job is perfect for the kids in collage,it offers flexible ours,kids can work seasonal  if that meets your needs.My biggest issue was working weekends,I wanted more time to spend with my Family."
good,It’s a cool place to work with a good staff. The store is always clean and efficient. But management needs a lot of improvement as well as the fairness to he employees.
good,"Management has almost no management skills and upper management makes the most backward decisions possible. If you think that it is a bad business decision, you better believe corporate will vote in favor of it. They have almost eliminated any room for advancement and taken away the ability to have a career. It is geared now more for a temporary position and because of the changes, the overall employee pool is filled with people with no work ethic or kids in school. It is a great TEMPORARY job and overall pays pretty well."
good,"Very high paced place to work, customers very demanding since you are dealing with their home.  Training associates and teaching them how to sell and interact with customers."
good,"I enjoyed working there under a great manager and learned a lot about the products we carried. The only negative was that as a summer hire they began cutting hours after Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, so I didn't get to work as much as I would've liked."
good,"I feel Lowe's has lost sight of the most important asset of any company, the associates. While making sure the company is competitive in the on-line marketplace is very important....I feel the associate engagement is suffering."
good,"decent job for part time or full time "
good,Good place too start out and can open many doors they will treat you well and will teach you many things for the company and other future jobs and you have main holidays off .
good,great people to work with.  Enjoy helping customers with their DIY product selection.  Opportunities to mentor and teach associates about products and construction SOP.
good,the place is a good place to work. has great benefits and bonuses. the raises are lowe and new people are making more than the ones that have been a while. for a job in retail its great but for a career it depends on personal preference.
good,"The job is easy, its basic retail if you can make it one year here you will be welcome to stay forever if you never decide to move on from here.  Good place to work while looking for other jobs."
good,Too many negative changes lately.  Do not promote from within at this time.  Tenured employees are not valued. They are losing their good employees to other companies.
good,"When  I was there it was poor management. It was a great place to work while in college, but as a career choice I would not recommend it. Great starting place for job skill building"
good,"Ok job pretty good pay and ok employees. Managers were selfish and greedy for money. Customers were calm and polite. Depends on management, possible flexible schedule."
good,Its hard work but the pay is decent and the benefits are good. Don't apply if your not willing to put in a hard 10 hr day. Keep a positive attitude and you'll advance quickly.
good,Good part time job.  Just wouldn't count on it paying for cost of living in the state of Connecticut unless your a manager.  Wouldn't recommend to someone who needs a full time job to pay for cost of living
good,You meet so many people with how big of a company it is. You get to build relationships and it feels like a family working there. You never know what the day will be like.
good,Good way to start a career if you are into retail. Meet lots of people who is grateful for any help that is provided to them. everyone must work together.
good,"It is a nice company to work for, but in a ""right to work"" state like AZ, pay is not high enough.  It is nice to be able to get the health benefits as a part-timer, but they are only preventative, so there is no ER coverage if ever needed. You can move around the store and try different departments which is nice also."
good,"it usually gets pretty busy really fast, and since i work at customer service we usually get flooded with customers pretty quickly, and sometimes you get stuck up there by yourself. it can be very stressful if youre alone but it also helps you focus more on getting everything done for the customer in front of you quickly. The managers typically leave everything up to us when it comes to handling the customers needs but they are always there to back you up if you need to make a tough decision on anything. "
good,Lowes was a great place to work but they are very strict. when it   got busy sometimes there was no help as a cashier. there was also no coverage for cashiers lateran in the day. at fist they worked with my school schedule but has people left the hours got piled on. it   did become overwhelming.
good,I worked in one department but would end up covering other departments almost every shift. Not the best pay but accrued vacation and sick time for hours worked.
good,"A fun place to work and good place to gain customer service experience. Stocking, loading and cashier experience are also learned from here. A good inbetween job."
good,Loved my work and the hours.  Not micro managed. Allowed to be creative in resolving problems.  Occasional free lunches. I was a one man department and would like to work more with others.
good,"I enjoy the environment at Lowe's, the management is great as well. Part time does not provide many hours at all. Also part time insurance is not ideal."
good,"Great place to work."
good,overall a good company treats associates better than other retail jobs. management shows blatant favoritism. they give opportunities and advancements to their friends not the most qualified
good,You work 10 hour shifts 5 days a week. The pay is very poor for the work that is being done. The management was also very poor with no direct person in charge.
good,"Decent pay, quick paced, stressful, but enjoyable. Would recommend to anyone looking for entry work, and getting paid to get a certification (Forklift Operating)."
good,Worked with a team of employees everyday to achieve sales for the day. All employees were given the opportunity to learn any department they wished. Easy transitions between departments.
good,Company is ok to work for. Typical big box store environment. Rotating shifts can be hard at times and poor staffing causes many departments to have only one person for 8 hours.
good,"dealing with some customers that are simply rude, but you still have to treat them as if they are doing nothing wrong to you at all. It is simply part of the job."
good,Lowe's is a great company. They are willing to help train their employees on what they need to know. When a project is to big for one person they will send help to make sure everything gets done. It's all about teamwork.
good,Lowes is a fair place to work.  It would be a lot better with better managers and better HR staff. I wouldn’t recommend working here. But that’s just me.
good,Every LOWE'S location is different and I enjoyed working at the Willow Grove location.  I did NOT like the East Philly location because management was terrible there. Although my job was more satisfying on the second location. Most people working at LOWE'S are hard working but underpaid. Most of them like helping the customers and enjoy the daily routine. A few of them are slackers and hide or on their phone most of the time. 
good,"Met a lot of people on this job, had some repeat customers that always came to me for advise on what to use on different projects. Delivered to different customers and companies"
good,"unloaded trucks, loaded merchandise for deliveries.  After unloading the trucks I used various merchandise moving equipment such as fork lifts.  I sometime when out on deliveries and installs."
good,Lowe’s is a great job! The management was kind of sad. They didn’t know who was working when and they were a bit unbalanced. The customers were usually nice and patient. I learned very quickly and was taught very well!
good,"Poor management it always lie, I always promised you a certain schedule and then they would change it the next week to meet their needs of the company not the needs of the employee and his family"
good,"Great place to work. Enjoy the people and the staff. Good starting pay. Would recommend job to anyone of any age to work at, especially as a first job."
good,tough work life balance. If you are looking for a 9 -5 this is not the job to have. You will work long hours especially during peak seasons. the compensation is good
good,ran register greeted customers doing stock I learned a lot by being there I mostly enjoyed the people the employees it was not bad some the management needed work
good,its a good company overall but the currant store i am in is not as good of a place to work. mostly due to the management staff and backdoor policys that are not consistant
good,"I have a great job at Lowes. I enjoy the team that I work with. I love working with customers and providing great experiences. I enjoy being part of a team and helping to develop the careers of other associates. With my background and experience, I enjoy using my own learnings thru the years in helping to teach and train others. i enjoy setting goals that are above company expectations , especially when I know the team has the potential to achieve more. I have been rated as a leading performer my entire career with the company and I enjoy exceeding goals that are established for me. I have an intense drive to achieve and be successful."
good,They need more employees to help. They want one person to do everyones job. They pay well and work with your schedule. People are generally nice. They need to hire people and keep them employed.
good,"Not a consistent schedule and they seem like they don’t work well with the scheduling, some people are better in the mornings some better at closings, and the staffing times are all over the clock"
good,"Managers will work with you in the begining and then after a few weeks they dont care. they never can get help to cover so i can take a break, you always have to go looking for someone to cover you."
good,Unfairness because they made you feel like the work you do dont matter no matter how hard you tried and the ones that did the least work got the promotions and that's why I left
good,This is a high customer service job. You need to know how to listen between the lines when a customer tells you what they want. Be ready for part time work and pay around $12 an hour.
good,"good place to work ,meeting nice and different cultures of people.we had fun funny caractures,i learn alot of things with different machenries .managemet was ok overal .no jobs are easy but only if you make hard for yourself .the main focus is do as you told n follow instrutsions.thank you."
good,"All told, it was a great place to become familiar with home improvement and the process of establishing a project to completion. This covers interior and exterior."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Lowe's.  It was fast paced but fun.  My supervisor was fair.  I always got the hours I asked for.  The only downfall was that I was only hired as seasonal; therefore, I didn't get any benefits.  I especially liked when I was assigned outdoor lawn and garden because of my love for plants."
good,great place to work while in college or as a part time gig. Some of the managers dont know how hard it is to work on the floor when a truck with 2000 boxes comes in. The people who work here are great.
good,"The management helped when they could, but some customers are quite demanding and require some patience. System is easy to learn and everyone there was nice and helpful"
good,"Lots of new changes and restructuring and direction of company makes me want to change jobs."
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for. They take care of the customer and associates.  They do a lot for the community and people.  I love working for them.
good,"Typical retail environment but with great training and direction. this was a relaxed environment, the people were great and the company was helpful in making sure you had the tools needed."
good,"lowes is a retailer of home improvement products and installation services, they are one of the largest distributors of appliances in the country and offer a wide selection of flooring & doors and windows and a full line of general building materials."
good,"A typical day at work is always a good day "
good,"I started as a cashier and then got moved to be like a front end supervisor. We rang up customers purchases, handles any isues customers may have had, processed returns, lottery, Western Union, ran front end."
good,"Working at Lowe's was a good experience but management of the store I worked at had problems. When the new store manger took over, there were a lot of changes that made work unnecessarily harder."
good,This is a nice company to work for. I feel like the management I experience cares about the staff. The coworkers I experienced were kind as well and willing to help me learn in the beginning. Overall it is a nice place to be.
good,"Lowes is a very good company to work for. They continue to assist their employees with learning techniques and online videos. You can learn about their products and services. They also believe in helping out communities in need, especially after dramatic disasters.  They send employees out to affected areas to assist the Lowes in that community to quickly rebuild and restore the community"
good,"Friendly staff, solid work environment, room for advancement. Company was helpful with scheduling conflicts"
good,"Lowe's is one of the best paying retailers you can work for, but be ready for stress, quick pace and plenty of policy/ management changes.  "
good,This is a good company to work for.  The hours and pay were good and I enjoyed working here.  I left because of a move to another city. I would recommend.
good,Enjoyable place to work.  Heavy lifting and climbing ladders to access top stock is common. Management is friendly and willing to listen to concerns but full time positions are hard to come by.  High turn over.
good,It was OK. The paint department was friendly and there was always something to do. Even when it was busy it was not stressful or competitive. I would recommend working there.
good,"overall good place to work, people seemed to care, typical company both good and bad,most employees worked towards one goal: helping the customer.but it is a business with stockholders,profit margins and board rooms and competion."
good,"It's a good company with solid benefits and a second family atmosphere. The hours can be a bit extreme during busy season but, all in all, it's pretty good company to work for."
good,"It is not a bad place to work, the benefits are good and they are willing to work with you as far as schedule. Job advancement is slow and very few positions open up to try and advance to."
good,"A typical day could be stressful at times. Overall it was a good job."
good,"as a freight unloader my job task where to unload the trucks use forklift and stock merchandise ,I loved to interact with customers and help them have a great shopping experience"
good,They try to make you feel like family. Also try to work with you in any way you need to grow as an associate. There are many ways to move up in the company and they always strive to improve the work place and always talk to employees to see if there are any needs they would like to see on the job.
good,My employment with Lowe's lasted for only a couple of months.  It was a seasonal position at the start of the spring planting season.  The work consisted of cart retrieval and customer assistance.
good,It has a lot of great leaderhsip that wants to do very well however a lack of teamwork and development hinders as a whole. It needed more integrated teamwork between the business partners when running the stores.
good,its a good paying job for some one looking for quick money but it not all that great once they see that you are a great fit for one post and you want stuck
good,"Worked in the Install Office/Production Office. We saw so many customer complaints, we called ourselves the complaint hotline. We put out fires every single day, for every single install-related department, and nobody ever cared. Instead, we were talked down to and berated for not doing our jobs. On top of that, the pay was not commiserate with the amount of effort and difficulty the job required. My department manager was great, and I loved the people. However, the way the company was run - firing people and ""restructuring"" management, that was cut-throat and awful. With hardly any notice at all, they up and got rid of a majority of the management positions and made everyone left in a management position fight for a handful of the new positions. I left because I was offered another job, and the store production office was switching to a CPO, which I hear is going swimmingly."
good,What i do is work in the garden center. It is a physical position but i enjoy that. The management team is good.  The hours are great. Benifits are excellent
good,good place to start a career in. customers are really depending on finding what they need while we are there to assist them. it can be challenging days but all within good reward
good,"Pros"
good,"There is a friendly and supportive work environment.  The pay is fair, and probably above average for retail employment.  Training is provided, but could be better."
good,"My favorite thing about my time as a Lowe's employee was problem solving for customers.  Finding something in our store that would solve their issue always brought me joy.  Also, as a DIY'er myself, I took pride in guiding people through home improvement projects."
good,The job tends to be pretty relaxed. Working in building materials there are many products to stock and there tends to be a lot of lifting. The worst aspect of the job is the occasional need to work outside in subzero temperatures or just inclement weather in general. Management is fairly solid and is willing to work with employees.
good,"If you are looking for advancement and furthering you career with Lowe's than as of now, this may not be the place for you. Earlier within my time at Lowe's, the company was thriving and advancement was all be guaranteed, if you put in the time and work, which I was totally on board with. When Lowe's cut their management workforce in half, I truly believe every aspect of Lowe's in-store business suffered, and because of that, I believe now, that if you want to advance at Lowe's its no longer about your work ethic, but more of if you are someone's favorite person.  In many ways though Lowe's is still to me a very good place to work for, They work with you as far as family obligations, offer fairly competitive wages (depending on the area you're in), and the people you work with are easily some of the most kind and caring people you will find, but advancement at Lowe's has now all become a political battle."
good,"It is a good place to work, in general a person gets to the working area and does a self paced job but still it has to be productive and show responsibility and care for performance."
good,"The best part of my old job was dealing with people everyday. Each day was different and required different skills. The problem was having to work with an ASM that thought he knew everything and bullied his way through the day. It gets hard dealing with someone that refuses to except they might be wrong or could learn something. In retail, regardless of the company, you never stop learning. Everyday you learn something new."
good,"Working at Lowe's was a pleasant experience.  There were several regular customers that made my job worthwhile.   However, the schedule was not flexible enough for me."
good,"Great place to work. I really enjoyed working there, the pay was great, the customers had problems that were easier to deal with. They pushed training on employees to allow the correct information to be passed onto the customers."
good,Good place to work if you are not necessarily looking for career growth in the immediate future. The company seems to lack a consistent structure though out the different stores. There is not consistency on policies among the stores.
good,This company has perks and opportunities to learn.  It also provides a diverse work experience with many opportunities to learn about subjects that may not have previously interested a person.  Once you get into the atmosphere you may really enjoy the fast paced environment and high-demand to fulfill customers' needs.
good,Decent place to work the staff for the most part are supportive & friendly great people to work with. Clean and organized environment. Learned a lot about customers and how particular/difficult some can be.There is a lot of running around involved because it is such a large store.
good,"I enjoyed my time working there. I hated that it came to an end. Lowe's is a great place to get some experience under your belt, provided that you have good management."
good,good company to work for. the customers were always very nice and cheerful which makes your job a whole lot easier. the area I worked in was slow paced but it got very busy during the holidays which I enjoyed
good,"I really enjoyed working for Lowe's Foods, I meat a lot of people there & even became close friends to both the customers & employees. I loved my job."
good,This is a great place to work for the young and the older alike.  There are many positions and opportunities available and the pay is fair in the marketplace.
good,It was a great place to work.  I enjoyed being able to get health insurance and not having to work inside the actual store since I was a delivery driver.
good,"With the exception of the one assistant manager I absolutely loved working at Lowe's and would love to work there again. The only job I want to do is cashiering and unfortunately the one manager that plays favorites is over the cashiers at the store #1635. I loved that I was able to be myself and everyone just accepted me and loved how I did my job. I tried everyday to make everyone smile and have a good day, whether it was customers or store associates. Everyone has issues in their lives but if I could bring smiles then that made me happy."
good,Due to short staffing you would have to cover many departments throughout the store. You have to have extensive knowledge of household improvement materials and tools.
good,"As a cashier here you don't really do much. You restock snacks, check people out and that's about it. You don't know much about the store which sucks because everyone comes up to you asking for help and you're as lost as they are."
good,working at Lowes gave me the opportunity to share my knowledge in helping client with their own home improvement projects.. I also placed special orders for merchandise that the store did not normally carry to fullfill costumer's needs and requests.
good,Trucks to be unloaded were not secured from the DC. Alot of merchandise was damaged upon arrival due to the DC personnel not loading trucks correctly. There was not enough room for the material coming off trucks to stage before taking to sales floor.
good,"1. Open and close garden"
good,"As a Product service associate the job is astronomically different than most everyone else in the store. The main focus keeps you busy away from customers while working a fixed m-f early schedule. "
good,Alright many people didnt like me though............so that was a down fall but there were also a decent amount of people i would view as friends too.
good,interesting interactions with customers and employees.  Every day is different and you will always have something to do.  Also you will get your exercise.
good,"During the slow months, unless you’re full time, the hours drop horribly. 20 hours a week or less. It’s a rough patch definitely. During the summer and spring, 30 hours weekly. If you start as seasonal, they often hire you on if you’re good at the job you do. The pay is nice enough for retail. You accrue vacation and holiday times. But you’re not guaranteed consistent shifts. Scheduling is all over the place if you can work anytime. Overall, it’s not a bad place to work. It really just depends on what type of management you get under."
good,Most people are fun to work with and can joke about different things. Dress code is pretty laid back. Has a app that can be used to locate items in the store and help customers when needed.
good,"Lowe's was an enjoyable place to work.  There was always something new going on so it was never boring.  The people (customers and employees) are what made this job so enjoyable though.  You are always meeting new people, which is exciting to learn about people and where they are from and what it is they are looking for.  Some of my best friends are my co-workers and that is one of the greatest benefits of working with Lowe's."
good,great job but you have to be careful to not leave money in registers and get a clear understanding of what the cashier is requesting be done. half communication can really beome an issue.
good,"Overall, I would rate my time at Lowe's as a positive one. I've been there for three years now, and I've gained a lot of meaningful experience that I will bring with me to my next position. I'm grateful to have worked there."
good,"I was lucky to work with a great group of people there, but seasonal employees or ""bad apples"" could put a damper on things. Otherwise, it was always easy to enjoy the work hours."
good,Lowe's is a customer focused place of business that targets the every day family DIY person. They value customer loyalty and working in the community.
good,"Opportunities Include but not limited to:"
good,"This particular Lowe's (transferred from another one) actually was well-run, stable, and had its affairs in order. The most stressful it ever got was during ""Contractor's Hours) (630am-1pm, give or take.) Th rest of the time was spent restocking as needed, or helping basic home owners, etc."
good,I enjoyed my time at Lowe's. It wasn't the best job but it was honest work and the people there cared for one another. Customers where generally bearable
good,"Lowes is not a bad place to work, but it seems to be a little different at each store. Personality plays a big part in the success at Lowes(Store Level). There seems to be a lot of gray areas as far as managing not always fair. You have to prove yourself each time management changes. I did not have problems with new management because I learned to adapt to different personalities and I also had excellent customer service skills. Exceeding customer expectations is the mission of all retail."
good,"Working as a contractor for Lowe's was something new for me. I was a delivery driver and installer for carpets for many locations around the Charleston area. Depending on the size of the house and how many rooms, at the most 3 houses would be finished a day."
good,"It was like being in high school again! Enough said right!! "
good,It was a good place to work. I enjoyed the employment and the people who worked there. Meeting and greeting customer was a pleasant experience. The hours of work was also pleasant.
good,"At lowes I mixed paint, helped  customers find their items. Cashier, worked in lawn and garden with plants and soil. I also helped in tools and worked in hardware stocking and making keys."
good,"Lowes has its challenges but overall its a great place to work. Customer service is key in the workplace. Management has the ability to make your job difficult, but if you're a good employee, the odds are less likely."
good,Great place to work. great people. Very positive experience working for Lowes. l only left my position with Lowes because l re-located out of state. l am currently seeking another position with Lowes.
good,"Lowes was a productive place to work. There were times that there were some issuses with the scheduling but they were able to take care of them if they could. I did like working for lowes but then there was a job offer that was more money for a set schedule which worked out better. Also, I was a part time employee working full time hours for awhile but never got hired on as an full time employee for the year plus i had worked there"
good,I really enjoyed working there. The people was nice and friendly. They didn't hesitate to teach me the things I didn't know. There was always something to do so the time flew by.
good,"Nice Place to work. Decent Coworkers, Management isn't the strongest and after the recent restructure noone seems to know what they're doing. good pay starting out but not a place to get rich."
good,Constant sales and promotions. Accessible information and education for all employees. Great team work and associated are friendly and willing to help
good,enjoyed working at lowes and would of stayed there but was hard to get in with full time hours and was the reason why i left but overall was a good place to work.
good,The responsibilities varied from day to day.  Every day I had to unload trucks and make sure that all the paperwork was filled out properly.  I really enjoyed this job.
good,"Typical deli department requirements, how to go about the usual talking to customers and making sure everything is to there liking. "
good,Great place to work! Constantly learning everyday with opportunity for advancement in the company. Management is easy to work with and are always willing to help out.
good,It was a great place to work at for the most part. Management tend to think of themselves more than the employees. Benefits are worth it. The hours were okay.
good,"Worked the paint counter mixing paint and recommended products to customers to complete their paint projects."
good,"once your clocked in, you never know who you're going to meet that day. the experience of helping other is amazing. the best part is learning how to drive a fork lift."
good,There is room for growth in this company. You must take action on your own career. Majority of the time the company lacks putting associates in the best position to succeed due to the lack of training or lack of proper training.
good,The management made it a point to listen to their employees and to make an effort to have a safe work environment.  It makes it hard for people if the management does not listen but the company makes it a especially important issue so as to provide a safe environment that customers and staff can come to.
good,"Good place to work, not very flexible on needing days off. Bosses are laid back and coworkers are good to work with. Hours are not optimal but thats retail."
good,"Will let you go on the spot once your seasonal time is up. They don't tell you when it is, just let you go. Other than that management is okay, a little strict. Customer care is important so management looks for that."
good,"I was only a seasonal employee.  Something I was not told until the orientation meeting.  Was not told I was going to either be extended or let go at the end of my employment even though I repeatedly ask my bosses what my status was going to be.  I was part of the freight team.  Unloading and sorting out freight trucks.  Summer time was the busiest. Usually a full semi-trailer truck of merchandise. A lot of walking and heavy lifting at times. No benefits either as I was only a seasonal employee.  Again, something I did not know until my orientation."
good,"It was a great place to work until all the restructuring took place with management. Managers now are hard to find, generally don’t answer their phones. We have a store manager, 3 ASM’s and 5 service managers. There are some nights where only one of the managers is working and 1 head cashier, if the head cashier is covering on a register and the manager is busy, there is no back up to help a customer who needs an override or a customer who needs a manger. They end up having to wait or leaving very upset.  Before the restructure we had department managers so there was always back up. Not any more. Our store has lost its heart."
good,I enjoy my job at Lowes and would recommend them as an employer. They pay well but have no benifits for part-time employees. I enjoy the daily meeting of new people u get.
good,World's Second largest US Retail chain in home improvement with it's Indian extension in Bangalore is a at it's nascent stage. The company gives you the maximum exposure to contribute your expertise.
good,"The typical day, these days, is nonstop on the go at all times with lack of staff to help the customers and lack of Store Manager interaction with anyone in the store. I learned that now, Lowe's has unrealistic ideas and goals with giving the needed help just save payroll and gain profit. It is not about the customer or the associates as they continue to tell us on a store level."
good,"Pay was decent, especially if worked overtime which was mandatory during certain times of year. Could not really ever be bored, the people were fun to work, and loved the team work."
good,I would recommend Lowes for someone who is looking to fill some extra hours in their life or to someone who is just starting out in the business world.
good,"During a typical day at Lowes I am constantly assisting customers, making sure that they get what they need. I also help customers load their vehicle."
good,"It's retail, experience depends honestly in good you are handling conversations and relationships with your supervisors and customers. But asking to change your availability is impossible. You must have open availability and cannot have set times in the week to be off."
good,The company as a whole is an amazing company to work for but unfortunately no one takes their job seriously which ends up with everyone mad at everyone for leaving meaningless tasks behind for others to eventually have to pick up the slack.
good,Over my time at Lowe's I learned a bit more about how to approach customers and help them by answering any questions they had about product and displays.
good,"Was a great place to work, except for the previous store manager that I worked under. Also, can be hard to get on full time and permanent. unless that is specifically what you have applied for. I also saw several instances of favortism, but that was my personal experience."
good,"I worked in a few different departments while at lowes. I started as a cashier and also a cart attendant. I later moved to deliver department where i would get the loads ready for the truck. whether it was appliances, lumber, etc. I worked the forklift and picker"
good,"Wasn't a bad place to work, but it was really hard to get full time hours. The pay was good and the hours were steady around 20-30. Hours were based on how many trucks the store got per week"
good,The job was interesting and helped many people with their projects.  The revolving schedule made it nearly impossible to be a single parent and find safe and adequate child care from week to week in Helena.
good,"If you're looking for work that pays well, Lowe's is worth checking out. However, because of company restructuring, be prepared for stressful situations where you don't necessarily have the help you need. Get permission for necessary administrative decisions. Get to know your coworkers, and even the customers, because the ones who care will have your back and help your days go by better. Do your job to the best of your ability."
good,The job is located at Lowes. The Manager was a respect and great person to be around. The other employees were very helpful and were polite people to work with.
good,"Great environment to work in. Co Workers are nice. Plenty to so, but you'll have plenty of help also. Not to stressful of a job overall. I would recommend to anyone."
good,typical day at work was busy and productive.  A great place for team members and staff to work to produce products.  job was easy to do.  Job consisted of working with different cultures
good,Great Place to grow in employment. working with some real seasoned employees and contractors can be very beneficial to a young employee. Lowes systems are a little outdated but it will allow you to learn to overcome challenges.
good,"Good place to work overall. Management does a descent job of looking out for employee's needs, can get overworked when they are short staffed. Not a lot of upward mobility from inside."
good,"This was a contractor job. I only worked on Saturday and Sundays."
good,"I was paid very fairly at Lowe's. I lived in Wasilla and they asked me to work in the Muldoon store. I was hired into a position where normally you work your way up to that position, there was little to no confrontation between me and my peers. A very good work environment."
good,Fund work place. Leaders were more like coaches than bosses. Company was strongly connected to community and provided employees time away from work to support community events.
good,"Lowe's is a good place to get experience early on in your career. They're a really large company so there's a lot of opportunity for growth and movement within the company. The culture can be very hit or miss depending on the department you're in because it's so large- so some groups have a really great, progressive, laid back culture, but others can be a little conservative and inflexible.There tends to be a lot of young professionals so it's easy to make connections with people early on in your career. The work space is great- the facilities are very nice with a lot of amenities onsite. The pay is decent, but not competitive and you don't really get enough vacation days. When you have less than 5 years experience you only get 2 weeks and 6 holidays. Additionally, teams/departments are being re-organized constantly and job positions are eliminated often. Overall, I'd say it's an enjoyable place to work, but if you're concerned about job security it probably isn't the best fit."
good,"The work at Lowe's can be challenging, but you have to have people skills, you can learn alot from the associates there,  they are very knowledgeable."
good,Great place to work with minimal work experience. Definitely learn a lot of skills and product knowledge. Decent starting pay. Works with school schedules. Health benefits and 401k.
good,"loved working there, just offered part time was the only bad thing.  Fun, high paced, great to employees.  Worse part was having to leave sue to not being full time"
good,"I liked working at Lowes.  I did feel the personal training was lacking and I was not sure who exactly was my supervisor.  There were 2 or 3 in the Lawn & Garden dept."
good,"I worked for a few months at Lowe's. The position I had was sales associate in the Lawn and Garden dept. I learned aa bit about customer relations in retail, something that I had not experienced. The management was up to par, except for a few middle mangers. Most difficult part of my job was loading mulch into customer's vehicles.Greatest part of this job was communicating with the customers."
good,It was a fun place to work. Everyone was great to work with. The hours were a hard a little hard on the commute with the traffic and weather. I learned a lot of new things and they have a good training process.
good,Hard work and friendly co workers.  I wouldn't say it was challenging physically but it was rewarding when helping a customer.  I would reccomend Lowe's to anyone
good,Lowe's is a unique company that i have been with for 5 years. The atmosphere with the other employees is of a family enviorment and its a very enjoyable experience working with them
good,"i worked in the shipping department when i was there. it was a tough job at first, but once you get the hang of things it is more enjoyable and very rewarding."
good,"You need to be a fast learner with Lowe's bc it's mostly on the job training. Computer system is completely out of  date. Once you learn your job, make sure you learn other departments as well because you will be covering those as well."
good,Don't really have much to say about Lowes but I know that I come in and give them 100 % every day but due to the down sizing in department managers I'm looking for opportunity elsewhere.
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes and selling appliances. I took a lot of pride in providing quality customer service to our customers and consumers and selling the right product to them.
good,"not a bad place to work if you're in school and looking to just have some cash on the side. "
good,"I good place to work. friendly co workers, lots of public interaction, ability to advance in the company as well as relocate if desired. benefits were good."
good,"A typical day consisted of checking out customers, processing deliveries, or assisting them with locating an item. "
good,Lowes is a wonderful pace to work. There constantly changing for the better everyday experience training is not hard mind the work is not hard but you have to work at a really good paste to make a 120 for production
good,Only have been at lowes for a few months and only work 3 days a week there. They have been doing well with some scheduling but sometimes i feel that it could be streached a little more between all employees
good,They hire people in that don't know anything about the departments they are put in. I was blessed enough that most of the other employees in the department didn't mind picking up the slack until I was up to speed. Quite often though people would call out and leave the newbie in the department alone which angered the customers.
good,"The company has a lot of benefits but also a lot of negatives."
good,I do not wish to comment due to the fact that I'm searching for a career currently & would like to stay on the good side of management................
good,I worked here for a good while and have many fond memories. Working for such large corporations can often be hard especially when management begins to make large changes.
good,Lowe's has been the best job I've had. I love every one of my co workers. Good place to work. The only thing I don't like it the scheduling. It's not fixed and you have to have complete availabilty to work there full-time.
good,"Big Box environment requiring you to learn your department and all others. Sweep floors, do stocking, take out the trash and your own work besides., Not bad hourly rate but their is little concern for personal schedules like school."
good,The company has the initiative and vision.  There needs to be more of a streamlined approach to what their future looks like in today's retail environment. Today they lack the tools and management for a fortune 50 company.
good,"Lowes was a great work. They offered great employee incentives, they did care about you. Although this company has changed in the last thirty years I can speak for the company today."
good,Had a great time at Lowes! Management was awesome they treated everyone like kings. Felt at home great place to work for anyone looking for a sales/cashier position.
good,"fast paced environment,  good learning experience, never enough help on the floor, typical day would be to come in finish overnight stocking, pull install orders, downstock your area, help customers throughout by yourself."
good,There is always something to do or someone to help.  I learned a lot working here and met quite a bit of great people I now consider friends.  Great opportunity to work and grow your skills.
good,"Work was Slow"
good,Lowes for the most part is a very great company and a fun place to work. it can be stressful with little to no training and at times stretched further than you can be to cover more than one department.
good,"A typical day at work involves a lot of customer interaction. I learned to drive a forklift, operate a narrow aisle forklift, and a order picker.  Management could v'e used some help. The workplace culture was very diversified. The hardest part of the job was the lack of staff in my department. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my customers."
good,The coworkers at Lowe's were the best part about the whole job. I believe that management could of been their for the workers instead of believing that the customer's were always right
good,I enjoy my job. I go in early and leave early. I get paid every 2 weeks and get annual raises. I like my co-workers.  It can be stressful but it's retail.
good,"Lowe's was a fun place to work, always meeting new people and helping them figure out solutions to their problems. Having to operate the machinery there was also a plus because I knew I could do it safe and no one would get hurt."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this company. Very friendly and helpful staff and management. The pay is competitive for retail work. The pay is rated off the experience that you have.
good,"Advancement doesn't seem to be based on experience or abilities.  More of a last man standing kind of system."
good,its ok. its a good first job and they pay pretty nice. really if your a weekday team member then your work life will be hard trying to learn everything
good,"Lowe's is an excellent company to work for.  It allows great potential for promotion, and diverse positions within the company.  There is a lot of face to face time with customers to help them improve their homes."
good,Compensation and benefits are great.  Seemed to be maneuvering by managers to hire friends.  Didn't care about well being of employees if they sustained unavoidable injury.
good,"As early morning logistics, I had to make sure the floor was ready for the store to open.  I really enjoyed the people at Lowe's.  The management was very nice and was willing to help when needed."
good,A typical day at Lowe's would be behind the cashier for about 6 hours a day. I learned how to become more social with the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was that the shifts went by quickly.
good,"I liked working for Lowe's."
good,Lowes highly compensates their workers as far as salary but it is fairly unorganized coming from the top down to upper management . The environment isn't as family orientated as they make it seem . If you can hold you own and have tough skin you can survive here . Moving up seems to be about who you know instead of performance but this may just apply to the location I was working for .
good,"Lowes is a good company to work for. There has recently been restructuring in the company that has made the day to day a bit harder than it once was. The kinks are still getting worked out but all in all, it is a good place to be."
good,"It was a great work environment with a lot of friendly employees.  There were many opportunities to learn new, unique, and tangible skills while on the job."
good,Lowes is a great place to work.  Recently there have been a lot of changes and it's just become less fun and more stressful.  People feel unappreciated and stretched thin.
good,I really enjoyed when the company was based and catered to the women  market  . very different that  Home depot  . I had a very enjoyable time my  tenure there
good,"this is a fast paced work environment with lots of room to grow, you can start out as a cashier and work your way up through the different sections of the store until you are in a management position."
good,"good benefits, good pay established organization. Enjoy team I work with. Reliable schedule & compensation. Enjoy working with the customers and co-workers"
good,"Benefits are so so, could be better. It is like your married to the job. Home life suffers, due to the demands of the job. Employee moral lacks due to poor management."
good,"good company to work for. care about employees. not willing to relocate current employees. good benefits. good schedule. vacation, holiday, sick time offered."
good,"I have gained lasting friendships, as well as, valuable skills and knowledge that will be useful in my future career. Lowe's has shown me new interests regarding my career path and broadened the spectrum."
good,Lowe's is a fun and relaxed workplace. I enjoy working with the public and helping customers find what they need to better their homes and lives. The management team is understanding and fair
good,my job involves helping customers find what they need for the projects they are involved in. i also keep my department clean and neat.the job has a decent wage for a decent set of skills.
good,Good hard work and I think if you work hard enough you can move up the ladder. But I don't see a lot of older people that have been working there. They should push for people staying with the company for a  career
good,You really felt part of team. Everyone was always willing to lend a helping hand. I was one of many customer service representatives. I enjoyed helping others.
good,Depending on who's working it can be a smooth job that day. Some of the higher ups like you think they are the big boss and do stuff that is not in the guide lines
good,"customer focused company, that strives to improve every day. "
good,"They tend to work with your schedule if you let them know well in advanced. Many different people shop at Lowe's so customer service skill are required and will be learned while working there. Also, product/department knowledge is beneficial to helping customers."
good,"I enjoyed working in the garden center at Lowe's. There was always fun and friendly employees and customers to work with, plus, I got to spend the day outside. Working inside as a CSA, on the other hand, was a bit more challenging. Customers and employees are more tense and uptight. I found myself having to run the register in the self checkout area more and more which was extremely boring during slow times of the day. However, I had more freedom to walk around and converse with customers and coworkers. Furthermore, I must admit that there were times when it was difficult to find certain tools and/or seasonal items, such as Christmas trees or mulch, that had a bar code to ring up at the register because they either didn't have one attached to the item, the bar code was bent or too dirty to scan, or the book of bar codes had pages missing or ripped in half."
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers but the management is very lackluster. Bad communication, unexpressed expectations, snap emotional decisions, and lack of transparency."
good,"I have very busy days, I enjoy the ability to give customer service.  I am not happy with the the fact that you have a real hard time getting on permanent with the company but all and all the people I work with are good people."
good,I was young and made plenty of mistakes with this company. They worked with me best they could to train me on better habits. I would recommend working here!
good,"good coworkers, good bosses, nice clean workplace, stress free climate, easy to complete ones job so as to help other coworkers."
good,Great job and management for the most part.  The only downfall was the company constantly switching company culture and organizational structure.  Pay was also not as good as it should be.  Would work here again though.
good,"Whether it is in-stock product or special-order items, serving the wide range of customer needs is very fulfilling and challenging.  Each order needs follow up and attention, from gathering in-store items and organizing them to follow-up with vendors and tracking down the best product. Best part is doing this work for each customer in multiple departments and see almost an entire house come together in a single sale."
good,Lowes was a great company to work for before they decided to restructure.  Now the work load is dramatically increased for insanely minimal compensation. I'm doing an assistant manager job for department manager pay all while the assistants walk around doing next to nothing and make us service managers do everything.  Not really worth it anymore.  Lot of turnover now.  Lot of long time employees either leaving or considering leaving.
good,"As a cashier, my responsibilities were to run the sales floor; maintaining cleanliness and assisting customers with their building project and provide any extensive knowledge learned to provide best customer service and devolving affable reports with customers. Hardest part of the job was answering/transferring phone calls while greeting and ringing customers up. although, I over exceeded and the best part, became that much better a performer."
good,"Good place to work on a short term basis.  When winter months come, they let a lot of part time employees go.  Management is extremely micromanaged.  Good starting job."
good,"It's retail so work life balance and decent schedules are non existent. But the pay was fair. Decent advancement opportunities, decent managers, the staff can be great depending on the location."
good,"There was always something to do, whether I was given a task or not.  I filled my down time with cleaning and organizing various areas.  I really enjoyed being able to work independently."
good,Freedom to run individual department as one sees fit for customer base.  I learned multiple skills/trades while sharpening my managerial skills.  I enjoyed helping customers love where they live and becoming an expert in multiple home improvement departments.
good,Balanced work space. Very friendly team. Able to flex around your schedule for most occasions. Good management and incentives. Proper training and training for power equipment.
good,I worked with a family member as a head cashier and didn't get much experience at work. I would work here again but probably not at this location I did learn a lot about flowers and gardening though.
good,"Pros -- loved working in the garden center, good co-workers once they become familiar with you"
good,"A typical day as a cashier is busy, busy, busy. Requiring you to push yourself to help your fellow co-worker as much as you can when you can. All and all, providing a steady and healthy workflow throughout the day."
good,loved it there    everyone helped each other to get the job done  loved the customers and the atmosphere   they always tried to make work fun and pleasent
good,The people are good i liked working there but there was not enough hours to work so that ment my paycheck suffered for it and i cant have that i have a family to support
good,Too much politics at the store level which holds back advancement.  Too many restructuring changes.  Not the best company at accountability.   steady job
good,The job itself was fun.  The training was lacking at best.  You learned from fellow employees which was helpful but the computer training was overdone and not interactive enough to learn from.
good,Have always enjoyed my job. The best part is being able to help a customer figure out how to fix or improve their home. Unfortunately the recent management restructuring has left us with a crippling manpower shortage. Corporate management is focusing on customers that are planning future projects with time to order what they need and forgetting about the customers that come in and want to buy something today.
good,"Work atmosphere is pretty good. Great place to meet a wealth of diverse and interesting people. The company offers many possibilities for growth. Overall, not a bad place to work. Many of my coworkers have been with the company for at least 5 years or more."
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work if you are people oriented and you know about things like tools, building, cleaning and repair. It has a fun team oriented environment."
good,"Overall good company to work for with great benefits. "
good,"Lowe's provides an environment which encourages you to grow. For me a typical day would be coaching, and mentoring a team of 170 people to provide excellent customer service. The workplace culture has improved over the past 5 years, and employee engagement is now a major priority for Management. There is still a degree of poor work life balance based mostly on the amount of time in the day they are open. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping a customer realize their dream home. The hardest part of the job is how many aspects of the job are beyond your control, like levels of inventory, or installer partners."
good,It was a great place at first then it became very stressful with angry customers calling in upset.taking phone calls all day long for 10 hrs back to bsck is the most stressful you feel like you have no time to do anything.
good,Overall its a good place to work. Depends on the people you work with that decides whether you like the workplace or not. The regular people that come in are the ones who make you smile and laugh. Its nice to see the same people over and over again and hear how their lives are going or the projects they're working on.
good,"I'm a seasonal employee, which means I don't get any benefits. But the management there is awesome & they're usually able to work with my availability."
good,"Simply put, working for Lowe's is not something that I would recommend making a career out of.  The amount of work that is expected to be performed daily is simply not something that someone should have to put up with.  The atmosphere at most stores is generally negative, the pay is average at best, and management can be hit or miss in its overall effectiveness."
good,"Lowe's has gotten away from taking care of its employees. Like every company, they claim to offer career growth through internal promotions, but only deliver on that claim if you are a favorite amongst management. The part-time benefits are minimal and taking time off can be challenging, due to black out dates during peak seasons."
good,"Mainly my job was to move shelves that hold appliances and make new isles. I learned how to drive a fork lift, a cherry picker and other machines. A great job."
good,"Great place to work, but under new structure and management. Can be confusing at times to find a manger to help with customer. also knowing whjo the right service manger is for the specific department."
good,Started working at Lowe's while in college. It was a great part-time job but not much of a career choice after the management restructure. Advance opportunities are almost nonexistent.
good,"How well the day goes depends on who the current MOD is on site. Most co workers are easy to get along with, but aren't held accountable for their actions"
good,"Daily cycle counts, inventory management, shipping and receiving, install of products, payroll and scheduling, margin and revenue control. Customer complaint follow ups"
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for. Great opportunities to advance. They work well with your schedule as well as any personal issues. Very family oriented atmosphere.
good,"Good job, friendly environment, work schedule was not the best, Didn't like not knowing schedule of working hours on a weekly basis. I like more structure and able to plan things ahead."
good,"They need additional training in people skills, policies and procedures and need to be held accountable for their actions and decisions at all times.  They have no problem holding other accountable."
good,Started at Lowe's in 2012 and it was a great place to work. Everyone was so helpful and nice to me. Now that everything has change recently it's lacking in management and floor coverage.  I love change and welcome it but going through this change is bad.
good,The managers at that location were very helpful and friendly. The computer system was archaic and made for an interesting day. Sometimes that was half of the fun of working there.
good,Clock in and report to assigned register.  Scan customer purchases.  Collect many forms of payment.  Bag merchandise.  Too many Chiefs and not enough Indians.
good,I liked it at first but after a year or so the management team was replaced with people that shouldn't have ever been put in those positions. I eventually quit due to management.
good,A typical day at work here involved being outside surrounded by trees and plants. I learned how to care for plants and flowers the right way. The management here was friendly and nice.
good,"I really loved this job at first but then after a while some of the higher ups will make it obvious that they have favorites and/or that they don't like you. You can try to report it, but EVERYONE in management or higher positions are friends so they have each other's backs. Other than that, I'd say it's a super easy job with really good pay and an option for benefits. If you work here, try not to make friends! Just stick to your work and you will be good."
good,Lowes is a great company to work for if you do not have a family.  It is very stressful at times and can take away from your personal life because of the hours changing daily and working nights and weekends
good,There are a lot of decisions made from the corporate level that severely impact the role of each individual store's management team. The selling tools are cumbersome and outdated for a company of this level. The installers subcontracted at the location where I worked often did not deliver satisfactory results for the customers.
good,"Very good environment.  Nice brake room with television, chairs,tables, re frigs,microwave and vending machines. Brakes where two 15 minute breaks and one hour for lunch."
good,At the store I was at it was a great place to work minus the fact that they would hold back people from moving departments or jobs if the management didn't want you to move. I was flat out told I couldn't leave the frontend bc I was to good but yet wasn't aloud to go full time.
good,This position gave me a chance to grow professionally. I was able to cross train in multiple departments and was given to chance to teach others as well.
good,Good job. I feel the pay is to low. Sometimes it gets to hot outside. I would love to have a job Monday through friday. Training at Lowes was not very good.
good,Very busy. Fast paced. Fun. Good training programs. A lot of middle management. Scheduling is subject to dramatic changes. Steady stream of job performance reviews based on secret shoppers.
good,Lowes is a decent company to learn how to operate power equipment and learn to problem solve quickly. It is also a good company to help jump start your future into a more promising career.
good,"As with large companies each store varies.  The rock hill location was like a family.  They are a supportive group who will assist when asked, cover when needed and even ask about your day."
good,A typical work day at Lowes is a very busy & productive one. It is known to be very busy at times with our day to day customers. The hardest parts of the job are standing on your feet all day.
good,Working in the garden center i learned a lot about different types of plants and flowers. I would come in early mornings and water all of the flowers as well as help customers in need of ideas for gardens and inside their homes.
good,"my overall feeling Great company"
good,"Lowe's is great for the part timer, in that it has flexible schedules and works with its employees better than any large company I have experienced. The problem is like most corporate jobs they like to stick you in a department and leave you advancing is difficult."
good,My favorite part of this job is the people I work with. Everyone comes together like a family and there are great employee relationships. A lot of helpful people.
good,"Coming from an Interior Design Education, I have learned an extensive amount about products and paint that helped me further my knowledge. The most enjoyable part about working at this company was the customer interaction I got to have and being able to make someones day by helping to improve a space in their home."
good,"Too many hours put in, but the job was fun.  The bonus structure was very lucrative, but not enough to offset the hours required.  There was a lot of opportunity for advancement if you were willing to relocate."
good,"Fun environment. Very customer friendly store. Always something to do. Hardly any down time. Management left a little to be desired, but overall a good place to work."
good,"unload truck, and greet customers to assist with finding items that they need for there home improvement needs, make sure the store stays clean and inviting."
good,"Hard work, but they pay well. Sometimes favorites are chosen. They may switch their job on you in a moment. The pay  is well for temps, and usually starts at 10/hr, depending on experience."
good,"It was a nice summer job, and I got along with everyone who worked there. Some customers were less than great but they were the exception not the rule."
good,Great people to be around as well as the management. You learn so much from all the departments you may want to build your own house after working there.
good,"Nice place to work, great people I learned a lot even though I obtained this job after working for the United States Military. Definitely a good place to get some summer experience and hours in."
good,"come in work do your part customer service be a team player, if you want to be part time make your hours known other then that Lowes we pretty good place to work"
good,Valspar is an excellent company to work for.  They have a high quality of standards which makes the people you work with think more about the quality of the jobs they do.
good,its a great place to work overall but is a pain when you acquire a injury some of the supervisors are real inconsiderate in regards and the company doesn't help with your injuries and the processes.
good,My management staff is great. I enjoy spending time and helping them when ever they need it. Lowe's keeps its stores clean but doesn't have enough staff.
good,Store management was very cooperative and supportive. Training should have been more in depth. Chance of advancement was fair if you were willing to relocate.
good,"Visitas a clientes de la cartera y atención a clientes en piso de la sucursal."
good,"It doesn't matter how you are you will do the same things over and over again. The typical day at the store I worked for is inventory replenishment, down stocking and helping people try to figure out what they need and answering the question ""where are the restrooms?"""
good,Enjoyed working there. Did not like the way I was treated at times. The hours were very long. Overall a good place to work. Management was okay. The hardest part was finding a helper and delivering Samsung refrigerators. The most enjoyable part was meeting the customers
good,"The typical day started for me at 6 AM lining up materials and subordinate responsibilities(up to 6 persons) for the day. Talked with management about upcoming jobs and/or materials that may be needed for the next week. Job experience was a time of growth for myself and my family keeping our time together in balance. The job taught me a lot about how to approach a problem and get it solved as quickly as possible to satisfy the client. The hardest part of the job was letting people go. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of the happy client with their completed cabinets installed"
good,Retail schedule is difficult to balance with family. Total compensation is good. Some managers are not the most supportive for you to do your job well. There is a nice amount of holiday and vacation time.  Depends on your management if they will let you take it when you want it.
good,The shipping department was a very face paced department that required you to work as a team. Very physically demanding and stressful at times but also very fun and rewarding.
good,Great company to work for.  I've been working here for over a year I enjoy working here the benefits are great but I would like to move into management and that is not available here at this present moment and it doesn't seem to be in the near future doing to the actual cuts in  structure of management
good,"Manage the training, detection, investigation and successful resolution of all internal/external investigations within assigned store. Good management team."
good,"Cleaning and stocking shelves. Unloading and distributing truck loads. Management is friendly, but co workers tend to be rude to each other and management does not attend to the situations."
good,"Must have a solid management staff in place with a good plan. Depending on the store, moral can be high or low. Nothing there was really difficult, just demanding, You might be pulled in 7 different directions at any given time. Free food quite often earned various ways, safety cookouts, holidays, etc."
good,"A typical day consisted of , greeting customers, loading and unloading trucks,shipping and packing merchandise,assisting customers in locating the proper tools and parts they needed to complete work or home improvement projects,measure cut a variety of different materials, stock ,clean /organize merchandise and shelves. This was the type of job were you are learning something new every day there are so many product you can learn about and it also gave me vauable experience in customer service. It also taught me a great deal about conflict resolution,theft control,and how to safely operate tools and machinery. The culture was a very family atmosphere were you work on projects as a team as well as independently.the hardest part of the job was turning an irate customer into a satisfied one by remaining calm and finding a way to change there mind about there thoughts on the service they were unhappy about,turning many into loyal customers.The most enjoyable part of the job was aiding customers with unconventional ways to fix and design their homes and complete projects. I gain valuable work experience in customer service and learned a lot about many different tools and ways to fix things in my own home."
good,Lowe's has the best benefits and pay in the retail industry especially in the smaller West Jefferson market.  It's over all a great place to work but there is a steep learning curve and you have a lot to take in from the get go.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my job at Lowe's.  However, they are a shortsighted company. For all their posturing about customer service, they do not keep the employees who make a difference over their competitors. I worked in installed sales, a department they eliminated. I had many customers who used Lowe's installed sales because they liked the fact they could call us directly in the store rather than calling a call center. However, Lowe's is like the little kid whose mom said if so and so jumped off a bridge would you.  Guess it is just the retail trend. Management at individual stores can be good or bad. Our store is sort of a training ground fo store managers and during my tenure we had good and bad, but the good thing was they weren't around long. The culture of the workplace can be troublesome mainly based on the store manager!  The most enjoyable part if the job was definitely my coworkers and the hardest part of a job in installed sales was dealing with complaining customers, especially those that really didn't have a reason to complain and not being backed by management."
good,"A good work environment, a good place to learn A new career. A company that rewards you for your performance. Bonuses and vacation paid. Discount to employee and perks!"
good,Love the customers and fellow employees. Management not interested in employee advancement. Hiring part time and must work in any area. Short on staffing and hard to find customers the help they deserve.
good,Great to meet different people everyday while some are regular customers. Teamwork is key. Great co-workers. Sometimes it is a high - paced environment but great atmosphere. Can be difficult to coordinate multiple customers at the same time. Meeting customers needs is great.
good,"Used to be a good place to work, but getting more and more demanding recent restructuring has increased workload for assstant managers. Never seem to have enough employees"
good,This was where I saw a lot of the development through myself. I was able to improve multiple departments as well as the department that was my home base.
good,I really enjoyed the management team in Georgia Lowe's. They were fun to work around as well as other associates. very welcoming me in to to the family of employee Let you work your pace catch on before sending you on your own. lets you be comfortable to work for them and easy to talk to
good,The opportunity for a varied work experience in all aspects of the HR disciplines.  Great diversity and the chance to really make a difference. Overall a wonderful experience.
good,This position gave the opportunity to be involved in many different facets of the company on a daily basis and a fast pace.  There is a need to be able to assess situations quickly and accurately in order to make timely decisions.
good,"Lowes is an excellent company to work for, and gives it's employees the opportunity to build sales skills. it even offers benifits to it's part time employees."
good,Lowe's is more of a seasonal store. Spring and summer are very fast paced and competitive. winters are not as busy. if you are willing promotions are available. with stores closer together you can move short distances to a different store to advance faster.
good,"Loved my job until the restructure, after which moral went through the floor in my store and have decided possibly it is time to part ways. All together a decent place to work."
good,"decent 40 hours a week, low pay at first but starts adding up within the years fairly decent based on budget of course. great staff very friendly, good place to work your way up."
good,"I enjoyed working in the environment, the people are great and very helpful. I would highly recommend this establishment for anyone whose interested in great customer service."
good,"The employees need more training and the management needs more training and personal skills. Far too many do not know how to speak to employees. At first working here was nice and I seemed to get paid well, after a year of working here I have only got a 23 cent raise while people starting after me with less experience are making more then me. This needs to change, promotions need to happen from within. The hardest part of this job is working for a management team that does not care."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me clocking on and going to the cash registers to begin my duties as a cashier. I learned how to drive a fork lift and became fork lift certified at this job. Management is very helpful and listen a lot. I informed management that I was growing tired of being a cashier and I enjoy hands on work, and they put me in the garden center for a few weeks."
good,Fun to work at. Easy going management team no matter the time of the year. Will teach you how to do anything you want. Job advancement is tough to go for.
good,"Always got the same amount of hours each week. Decent pay. Work isn't necessarily difficult, but in the summer outside it gets tiring easily with sun and lifting/moving."
good,"⦁	Smile greet all customers in a friendly professional manner."
good,Great Benefits and chance for advancement. There are chances to work in several different areas and learn many skills. You however have to want to be put in those positions. If you want to stay where you are then you can.
good,"Lowes is an awesome place to be inolved with. with the various departments that you could be eligible to work in, you learn new things every sinlge day."
good,the only real con to working at lowes home improvement is that you work late hours and the schedules are not rotated as often as they should be but this has gotten better over the years.
good,"The Company trained me for floor sales, customer service and receiving as well as certifying me as a forklift operator. I was the first one in my class to pass.  I received the trucks: following company procedure from start to finish with accuracy."
good,Started my career as a cashier and worked my way up to ASM/ Sales manager. I learned a lot and gained valuable experience.  In the 18+ years I worked for Lowes I enjoyed working for the company and worked with a lot of great people.
good,I provide product assistance for customers and my pears. I get to walk and great all customers as well as work with them in getting the product they want.
good,"While working for Lowe's I learned a great deal. The company allowed me the opportunity to expand my knowledge in merchandising, operations, P&L ,HR, and people skills"
good,"Lowes never stops improving, from the check out to the customer service that is provided. Management biggest concern is the service that is provided to the customers."
good,Company provides ample opportunity for learning new tasks and trades. Company encourages growth and promotion from within. Company has great benefits package for full- and part-time employees.
good,Well i was selected out of a bunch of other people whil i was in job corp at the time i wanted to do something while i was there at the time so i figured get a job or something out of the corps
good,every employee works in many different departments not just the one you were hired for.  There is no longer any dept. managers and so there is no room for advancement.  the hardest part of my job is not knowing where i'll be working that day until I get there.
good,the work I do is very physical and testing but in all I am able to take care of my family so in all it is worth it because of that nothing more other wise its a job and its retail
good,"The work life balance at Lowe's is amazing, HOWEVER the constant reminder of layoffs due to new corporate building opening in Bangalore becomes very stressful and overwhelming."
good,Helping people accomplish their home improvement tasks was fun and rewarding.  The people I worked with were very kind and made me feel part of the team.
good,"This company is now closed. Learned forl klift driving "
good,I worked there for three years as a loader in Florida and they treated me well as an employee. Friendly co-workers who you can become friends with and get to know.
good,"I used to really love working here, but since they went through a corporate restructuring,  everything has gone downhill. Really sad to be having to leave"
good,It's an okay job.i like working with people as a team. I love the schedule most of all. I work weekends and it's convient being I have two small kids.
good,"- Very High Chances of growth as a growing company"
good,"If you are only interested in making good money operations leadership is the place for you. Good luck seeing your family ever. I worked at the corporate center in Wilkeboro, NC"
good,"This was my only experience in the retail industry. I started as a sales clerk and moved up several times in just a couple of years. I finally decided the retail industry was not my cup of tea, but Lowes was good to me, paid well, good benefits, great retirement benefits and I learned a lot about management and supervision while I was there. They offer a lot of opportunities to advance and get training and if you work for them you should take every opportunity provided to you it will propel your career. I worked with some great people at Lowes and they are a generally well run company with well defined roles and expectations."
good,I am usually going at 100mph all day. I think perhaps the hardest part of my job is trying to help everybody that calls on me. I have been here 13 years this May and have quite a large client base. I am often training new employees. I open new commercial accounts on a weekly basis and go above and beyond trying to save my customers money and make their shopping experience a good one.i pay close attention to detail.
good,I love the company itself. I'm not too fund of some of the people I work with but I do love working there! The pay is good but the hours aren't that great!
good,In the paint department I was able to work and meet with customers and get them the type and color of paint that they wanted. This gave me the opportunity to work with others and solve problems.
good,"Leadership role to maximize sales and productivity through successful daily routines.  Ownership of Financials and Commercial Installs.  Customer satisfaction with delivery of quality products, and goods along with teaching methods for self-installs.  Sound understanding of Customer and Associate needs to gain a sustainable business model.  Repeat Customers and long term Associates reinforce that a culture of respect for the individual was achieved."
good,"The managers often contradicted each other, and I worked there for months before some of them even knew who I was. I had a few excellent coworkers, but many of them seemed like characters out of a horror film. They were constantly warning me: ""Don't let this become your liiiiifffeeee!! Get out while you still can!!!"""
good,Lowe's is a fortune 500 company that offers its full-time employee's complete benefit packages with 401K and stock purchase plans. It services professional contracts as well as the DIY'ers. Provide full spectrum services for its customers.
good,"Great company to work for typical days during peak seasons were enjoyable. Very focused on the benefits of the associates, and promote growth."
good,"I have been with Lowe's for 15 years and, for the most part, have been happy here.  My position is going away and will be replaced by a Central Production Office."
good,"great work environment, tends to be very micromanaged and could give out better raises for the work being done and expected"
good,"Lowe's is one of the few companies that really takes care of their employees. Sadly, it is not a job that allows me to attend College while working full time."
good,Good company to work for. Job is hectic due to staffing issues but overall an enjoyable retail experience. Upper management always seems to be there when you are in need which is not common at a lot of companies.
good,It was a very nice job and the individuals were great to work with and seeing the smiles on their faces made my job way easier.
good,"In my years at Lowes, I very much enjoyed the comradery and the feeling of being part of the team. I had very good leaders and my coworkers worked well together."
good,"Overall, I learned a lot from Lowes. This was my first major role after graduating college. I believe the pay could have been better for the tremendous workload.  However, I loved the employees and grew as a professional."
good,"Initially, Lowe's was a positive, nurturing work environment.  Advancement was possible and encouraged.  Positive, as well as negative reinforcement was given.  Due to the recent restructure, all of the Department Managers lost their positions, less than half were promoted to new positions, and the remainder were given a year in a reduced capacity at their current wage to find another position in or out of the company to transition to or be terminated.  Also, at least one Assistant Store Manager per store was immediately terminated.  Most of the available positions involve taking a substantial cut in pay to have job security.  Even then, with current situations looking like only the tip of the iceberg, no one is sure what positions will be next to be cut.  Hence, the lowered morale throughout the entire workforce."
good,"Easy going job"
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for with a friendly staff and a stable work environment. The hours are steady and guaranteed.
good,the problem wit lowes is they have a high turn over rate.Leaving u swamped with not enough workers during slow season they cut hours and are slow to hand out full time
good,Lowes is some place to work if you like freedom to manage at your own pace. You can be in charge of making your own decisions on servicing customers.
good,"Lowe's has always been a good employer to work for. There are shortcomings just like at every job, but I feel it is a workplace that I am extremely comfortable with."
good,I loved working there. it just really made me upset that they hired me and then six months later they laid everyone off. and ive tried to reapply but theyre apparently still LAYING OFF
good,its fun meeting new people and catching up with known people.It fun learning about new products and learning new and unknown systems.
good,"I liked it. I learned a lot about interacting with different people, whether it be other employees or customers. I would recommend working there to other people."
good,Typical day as a manager consists of delegating responsibilities to a group of 12 supervisors.  Helping supervisors manage the workload vs. staffing while adjusting to the demands of the customer.  Overall fun atmosphere.
good,Training is ongoing since there are so many products in each department.  Location of all store products to direct customers is a constant duty and mobile devices are available for that purpose
good,Lowe's has a  very diverse work culture. Fun work environment. Employees are empowered to make decisions in order to make sales and build customer relations.
good,"Was on track and moving up as planned. Like many corporations Lowes decided it would be better to have more faces in front of customers as opposed to fewer knowledgeable associates. 2400 mid level managers terminated immediately and remainder given one year to either accept lower pay or get terminated. Was a superior company to work for, not so sure now... we will see"
good,Never a typical work day in retail.  Job function required multitasking in a high volume sales store.  Best part of the job was the interaction with customers.
good,Typical day would consist of loading freight into tractor trailers with stand up forklift. Then sending the trailers to the stores at the end of the day
good,Every day was different and a new learning experience. Interacting with customers was both enjoyable and challenging. Co workers are the company's best asset.
good,Good place to work; friendly people; flexible hours; clean and safe place to work; worry tons about safety! Good management. Easy job
good,Do not work here if you are expecting it to be like working at target or wal mart.  Customers expect you to know pretty mich everything about construction.  Of course they will train you.
good,It is a decent place to work. Like any retailer be ready for change. If you are able to get full time the set rotation is nice for planning.
good,"Had the opportunity to meet great people, both fellow associates & customers.  Helped provide customers the necessary items needed to complete their projects."
good,"very friendly enviroment, staff was very helpful as well as managment , overall a great place to work, very flexible when it comes to scheduling I.E if you have school ect."
good,The benefits of Lowes is very good. The 401K option has helped me build my retirement funds. The healthcare benefits are very good.
good,"Not much promotion opportunities, steady so no busy work, job doesn't give much emotional relief, can get boring, bad communication skills, calls are graded if calls aren't good they terminated"
good,"I have met a lot of great individuals, most of which are more than willing to teach others what they have learned.  The work environment is very casual.  Organization is working hard to be omni-channel.  Organization is always looking for opportunities to ensure it will survive in the ever-changing retail climate."
good,For the time that I worked there everybody else that worked there was nice and helpful and the whole experience was great. The one that I did not enjoy was that even though I did not work there for that long they put me in charge of a lot of the stuff and some of the stuff that needed to be done could not be done because they also took forever to get me certified so that I could do everything they wanted me to do.
good,Great company that realizes that changes are needed to help the continued success of the business.  Values associates and customers by being a company driven by a purpose.
good,"Its an ok job if you like drama and everyone dating the whole store, I have nothing else to say. now leave me alone about the job that I am trying to quit."
good,"Loved working at my Lowes store, heavy customer traffic on the weekends, can put you to sleep during the week sometimes, open early and lots of weekends"
good,The best part about my job was my co workers and my regular customer.i enjoyed my job very much. Providing great customer service and making the customers happy.
good,is great to work in this place but the pay rate is not that great. if the pay was great it will be a great place to work at. Management was great to work for.
good,"Over great experience, Keep your self busy as soon as you walk in to the time you leave. Great exposure to operations and sales. You will learn team work with your fellow co-workers. However, You are not micromanaged by your direct supervisor, so you have to be able to work independently and be prepared for a thorough walkthrough of your work at any given time."
good,Great place to work. It has its ups and downs just like every other place. Probably one of the best places I've worked at in a while. I would highly recommend it.
good,"relaxing work environment"
good,"Nice place to wrk, Management was not that great. Management changed often from store to store because if one store was doing bad they wanted to take good management to the ""bad store"""
good,"I have learned there distribution warehouse and my experience is skill perform a lot things and get along with coworker , they did provide what my need for example interpreter when have meeting or something"
good,It depends on the store you work at I was originally I. Sulphur Springs Tx and transferred to Mansfield Texas most of the managers in Sulphur Springs were good and did there job. When I transfered to Mansfield it was totally different. The store did a lot of things different and I had told them before I started I had another part time job and gave them my hours available. I was still scheduled to work when I had to be at my other job.
good,"I liked this job. Paid more than most entry level jobs, came with benefits, managers were nice.  Working as a cashier was more stressful because breaks weren't always scheduled or given."
good,It was always busy and the customers made the days interesting because they always had something different everyday to ask about.
good,overall was a good company to work for. very well ran by management. not really enough hours to go around though. they hire so many people so there isnt really much money to be made here unless you can move up to management.
good,"The ONLY bad about Lowe's was the pay/benefits. No annual raises. Low starting pay. No bonus potential. There was a lot of fun to be had. There was also a lot of ""tell me to do it and leave me alone""...which I loved. Less than ten per hour is not a bread-winning or bread-supporting job for that matter. Lots of good managers that will just come shoot the breeze with ya whether you're on break or not. Lots of practical jokes, card/gift giving that make it feel like friends working together. The day to day doesn't change a lot. Days that you work can be set the longer you work there. Most holidays are worked."
good,"The employees here were very nice. The management team is okay.The benefits that were offered were not very good, but overall it was a pretty nice place to work for."
good,"Work with a variety of people. Management is good. if willing, you can learn a lot about home improvement. Always task to complete. Good team environment."
good,"Stocking selves, setting up displays and helping customer find what they were looking for learn that people have different ways to accomplish their projects.Worked with pleasant and helpful people. working with damaged or returned items was the most unpleasant part of the job. Working in a pleasant and positive environment made the day go better."
good,"As a delivery driver, I try to make small talk with customers, tell the same jokes that work, and be overall nice and give compliments.  Most customers know that a complaint will get them a 10% discount, so they will call and complain.  or the managers change the delivery schedule after we have everything ready for the next day.  The biggedst problem i have though is getting blamed for a truck breaking down when i had been telling the delivery manager about the check engine light being on for a week, as well as writting it up on the daily inspection sheets.that does not seem like good management to me."
good,Lots of neat things about this company.  They are very open to family and care for their employees.  Enjoyed working for this company during my tenure.
good,"Working at lowes at first I didnt think I would like it at all but it turned out I learned a numerous amount of things from my co-workers. I learned management skills, I learned how to close sales. Hardest part of the job is working on a slow day. Most enjoyable part all of the luncheons."
good,"Enjoyed being able to learn so many different jobs inside the company. Besides working most positions on the front end, I was able to learn to drive a fork lift and a cherry picker. I also cross trained in different departments, which help me with the main focus of customer service."
good,always working non stop workers willing to help each other out at job sites. enjoyed learning a new trade would recommend the trade
good,"I wouldn't recommend this position for everyone, it's long hours, it's a lot of lifting and moving bulky items.   "
good,"not bad for learning more about the tools of the trade."
good,It is a great place to work at if you are looking for a low stress environment.  Everyone at Lowe's treats each other like family.  They crack jokes at each other while working and motovates each other to work harder.
good,nice working environment but at times was impossible to work there as managers feel they are not like anybody else and don't take advice from anyone that works with the problems on daily basis.
good,"Good place to be on very large programs. "
good,"Wonderful company to work for if you looking for full time work with  hours all over the place and great full time benefits.  I don't think it is the best place to work if you have kids and you are looking for somewhere to work between the hours of 8-5:30pm to get the kids to school and daycare and etc.  To be able to work these hours, you have to be a part time employee and benefits for a part time employee are not that great if you have any medical conditions.  Part time benefits are preventative."
good,"Working in retail, every year my co workers and I would have to set up christmas in late September early October.  Many times we would have to work overnights (not our decision) but we always made the best of it and had a blast."
good,time management and management leadership could use improvement. they don't communicate with their employees as far as ads and new communications for the store
good,"depending on the store, when it's not truly following company values, its hard on people with a passion to do their job.  the most enjoyable part of Lowe's is being able to help people just like myself in their home projects from DIY to setting them up to have the company install product."
good,"Lowe's is a strong brand, our customers know and love the brand. This is a great place to work, the work/life balance is very good. The biggest challenge is the amount of change you experience, every 6 months there is a major shift...its retail."
good,"Did weekly jobsite inspections to assure that project is being completed in a timely manner and all requirements are met."
good,The co workers was easy to get along with. You can learn a lot. Breaks was only an hour. fast paced place. A lot of responsibility. Good Team work. Flexible schedule.
good,Would love to be an asset to a company like that again. They were fair with number of hours giving per week. Everyone works as a team towards a common goal.
good,I made sure my department was fully stock every night before the store open early in the morning I unloaded the freight made pallets drove the order picker and clean my working Area and also help other than apartment we were done until everything was done we made sure the store looks good all the time..
good,"As far as retail is concerned, Lowe's is probably the best retail store to work for. 1516 has some really great people working there, many who have been there for more than a decade."
good,This company has great benefits and promotes education. The company provides tuition reimbursement. The company provides 401k and insurance for part time and full time employees. The scheduling would be my worst encounter.
good,"A typical day keeps me busy from the time I walk in until I go home.   We all work as a team to better get things done.  I enjoy the customers I meet and I build a trusting relationship with them so that they feel comfortable and can trust me with helping them with their needs.  A lot of times they will come back to me and ask me to help them and thats the best part of my job."
good,"While working here, I had the opportunity to work with some really awesome folks. Management changed several times while I was there but the over all feel of the place was 'family'. A really awesome first job!"
good,good environment to work in. good team work; understanding workers. organized management and safety first. Best place for customer service.
good,it was a good experiance i learned alot about diffrent aspects of the company. i also got a chance to get familer with the power equipment like the fork lift and the order puller etc..
good,"My typical day at Lowes was 8-9 hours long, with a one hour lunch break and two 15 minute breaks. I would typically start off by cleaning the department and helping customers, than i would down-stock and prepare orders for customers, and at the end of the day I'd clean the department."
good,Not a bad job at all I would definitely work there again. Being a cashier at lowes wasn't very complicated at all fast pace and very friendly work environment
good,"I wake up at 3 in the morning to get to work by 4 a.m. its a major responsibility. The workplace taught me how to work under pressurized circumstances, the managers understand that it may not all get done but they also sometimes wish for too much with out acknowledging the reality of frustration the job comes with. My fellow workers are all inviting and social but too social. The critical part of the job is managing to completely function so early in the morning, but its great to be able to leave earlier then others to enjoy the day."
good,My job was mostly to serve customers in the outside garden area. Being a seasonal employee only gave permanent hires every reason to leave projects for me to finish or even start for the simple fact that Im the one the needs to be hired not them.
good,The associates are very knowledgeable about what you ask them about. Go to any department and ask the designated employee and you will have your question answered instantly.
good,Lowe's was a good company that does a lot for their employees. They provide good benefits and do what they are able to so their employees may succeed.
good,Working at Lowes required a lot of fast pasting work and having patients with customers. It is a very busy store and our top priority was great customer service. I worked at the Front End which i am responsible for cashiering and working at the customer service desk. Cashiering was easy after learning all the policies because customers have questions all the time and me providing them with the right information was a great success after seeing them leave satisfied.
good,"lowes is a good company providing competitive wages in that type of work.I have learned customer service skills, product shipping management and many other useful skills."
good,"Productive, supportive environment built around good people and good teams. Young and fresh management and upper management staff."
good,"Worked as a sales associate "
good,Shifts were very flexible. Depending on where you work it can either be easy or hard to make performance. You just have to go in with the right attitude and good things will happen.
good,A typical workday for me here was coming in and unpacking appliances to take out on the delivery truck. I went out on delivery to install appliances in customers houses. While working at this job I learned a lot about customer satisfaction.
good,It was a good work experience with Lowes. They was teaching if I wanted to be in being a Contractor this is what type of work I'll be good at.
good,"most of the time we were short handed , I learned how to set up accounts , half of the management was good but the others are way to power hungry and  disrespect  the employees, my co works were, are so caring  and friendly , i love them, they were the reason I love working there , the only reason why I left was because of a manager it was so hard working for him"
good,I made Lowes my career path. I worked with them for a total of 29 years. Started as a driver and worked to warehouse manager the first time I was with them. Inventory control and placement of merchandise in warehouse and yard. The second time I started as a gate guard and worked my way up to assistant manager
good,Lowes is a great company and you work with great people. Often times it is the management that makes work difficult. The customers definitely can be what makes the job great of more difficult. This job was great for my position in life and I learned a lot from working here.
good,"The actual store manager was really nice to me as well as the head HR lady. A couple workers who were transitioning into management were nice too. But other wise it wasn't a very pleasant place to work in. Overall it was kind of dreadful to be honest. I had an opportunity to move up (via store manager), but I turned it down because it just wasn't a place I wanted to be. Money is not everything, if you don't like the job, I believe you won't help the company or yourself."
good,A typical work day for me is to come in and evaluate the situation of what needs to be completed and I spend my day making sure that those things are done.
good,"a typical day would be your basic warehouse jobs, depending on which department you are in. Very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. management was ok, most co-workers were ok, but tend to be a lot of drama throughout warehouse, almost like high school"
good,People as in co-workers are the best part of working here.  They will take care of their employees mostly.  We have a lot of cookouts.  A lot of time is spent training.
good,It was a great store to work for as well as company. The only reason I had left was because they were cutting hours for all employees.
good,"ups and downs like all jobs. Mostly good employees, some are sorrier than others. Need more appreciation and acknowledgement from all management"
good,"I worked at Lowe's over 10 years ago and I enjoyed my experiences. Customers will always put demands on the employees, but that's what you're there for: To help people spend their money. Gain as much knowledge as you can about all departments so you can help customers around the entire store."
good,I worked in many departments also inside and outside. Nice work place. Alot of hours during the spring season. After spring season shortage of hours
good,Great place to work as team. I was fortunate to lead some great teams and made some great friends in the process. Stay focused and work hard and you can make it up the chain.
good,"I loved working here. The management team is very friendly and flexible with my school schedule. Coworkers were friendly as well and created a great working environment, stress-free."
good,I enjoy helping people and asking them about their projects. I like it when they seem genuinely happy with my experience and answers or suggestions. Lowe's is a great place to work. I would like to be able to use more of my artistic abilities. I have tried to get into another department but it hasn't happened.
good,"A typical day for me is just assigning cashiers tasks throughout the day in terms of keeping the area clean, keeping shelves stocked and assisting customers. I've learned to use efficient time management. My cashiers work as a great team. The hardest part of the job is maintaining good customer service with no/short coverage. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my associates, we've become like a family."
good,Many departments to work in and fellow co workers were great to work with.  It was a seasonal job but it enjoyed it while it lasted.  Good company to work for
good,"Hired for one job and ended up having to learn others, Understaffed. But great company to be apart of everyone felt like family"
good,"lowes is a fun place to work at. management is really cool, they don not demand stuff to be done. the make sure you know what you are doing to get the things needed done in the store."
good,"Not a variety of opportunities for advancement. once you have reached the ""top"" its not two many more options. Overall great company to work for if you are younger or have great skills in "
good,I loved working here and WA S going to make it a career but corporate bright in a monster to clean house. Everyone was fired and now they won't hire new people. The store manager they braught I. Was terrible but the people I worked with and for were great. Good benefits and decent enough hours
good,"Working as a customer service leader, I gained great experience with forming relationships.  No matter how long I was in contact with a potential customer, I made sure to exude confidence and friendliness."
good,I enjoy my job because everyday brings new challenges and learning opportunities.  I work within a small team inside of the legal department and enjoy the opportunity to work and learn from others.
good,"good company with competitive pay. work culture can get a little ""click-y"". Constant opportunities to move within the company depending on your commitment to wanting to be with the company."
good,"I would deliver loads to customer homes and drive a flatbed semi trucks ones in a awhile .  The only part I enjoyed was delivering product on the flatbed . Hated delivering washer dryer, fridge and dishwasher to customer home because they would get to picky! Lowe's policies is customers all right. So you gotta watch what you say and act , especially being in customer homes."
good,"Work long hours for little pay. As a manager you have to steer away from becoming friends with co workers, although, most of them do a great job of making sure their jobs are done correctly. I strive to do my best and make sure all work is completed in a timely manner although it is difficult to give all of your time and attention to a job where you feel that none of it is appreciated."
good,The everyday job went by smoothly most of the time. It was when you actually needed to do something you couldn't find the things to properly do that task.
good,"A physically demanding job, that most who have applied for have quit from while I have been there.  Management struggles to keep a full crew hired, and never praises the crew it does have for its efforts."
good,"Typical day at work for a department manager involves overseeing 10-20 people, acting as Assistant Store Managers. Workers are spread thin, but held to a high standard of productivity, higher yet for management. My Human Resources manager and Store Manager that I current work under are the ones who hired me, and they have been the most helpful management I could ever have hoped to work for."
good,"Did not work there long.  The time that was spent as an employee was very productive, and the company is very team oriented."
good,"I worked in the Outside Home & Garden department so it was a tough job in terms of weather and lifting heavy materials for customers. However, my co-workers in the department were great and made everything worthwhile. The customers were also overall pleasant to assist."
good,"Lowes has great management and plenty of opportunities for growth.  The health benefits offered are very good.  The atmosphere is friendly, focused on always keeping safety first."
good,Talking to customers and helping them find what they need is really all you do.  You will learn a lot of things about your specific department.  Once you are hired it is very hard to lose your job.
good,"Lowe's keeps me busy, I've learned how to operated a fork lift, and order picker.  Magment is easy to talk to, they're great with employee's and they seem fair.  My co-wokers are a lot fun and great to work with.  The hardest part of my job I would say is installing refridgerators and second floor laundries.  My favorite part of my job is driving."
good,"A nice place to work, grow and learn. If you enjoy interactions with home owners and contractors then this is the place to work."
good,"not much to review i was there on a seasonal basis, each store is diffrent based on the staff and how they function its to review a company on just one location"
good,"Working at Lowe's expect long hours, with below average pay.  It can be rewarding as you learn management skills, but it is not a long term career for me."
good,Working at Lowes really made me feel as if I were part of a team until it came to management. There was more cursing than conversation. Its hard to focus and keep a smile on your face when you have people talking down at you rather than showing you where you went wrong.
good,"Great retail environment to work at.  Helping people making changes to their homes is a joy for anyone.  Very helpful co-workers, even if you are new.  Management does a great job of helping out with gaps in scheduling as well as handling issues with customers."
good,i loved working for this company at first but then shifts in management and unfair hiring practices led me to find other employment.
good,"As a Millwork Specialist, I was to special order products (doors, Windows, lumber, roofing, trim) to customer's needs, to their exact specifications. I loved helping customers out, giving them the information needed and even when it came to a simple personal conversation. I made sure that before they were to submit their order, every detail, down to color, was the way they wanted it so there would be no mistakes. I would interact with every customer that came by to make sure that their day was going better than mine, and if it wasn't I would try to make sure that before they left, their day was going great. I also had to do daily stocking of in'stock doors, windows, and trim. Work with a forklift, Narrow Aisle Reach truck, and an Order Picker."
good,"The weekend shifts are long, but it's only 3 days a week. Able to work alone or as part of a team. Management is friendly and approachable. It's long days in a hot warehouse but the people are good and there is constant opportunity to make bonus."
good,Awesome Co-workers and nice place to learn new things about home improvement and new customer service skills. I love assisting  customers and helping resolve their issues.
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for as a start up job with the possibility of good hours and benefits if you commit yourself.
good,Lots of opportunity to grow and you would learn a lot about the retail business. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. Managers are respectful and helpful.
good,I learned alot of useful things that will come in handy in my daily life and I met alot of good people. The management team is helpful and is willing to talk about anything.
good,"My Department manager was a perfect example of who you would want to work for.  She made the position entertaining.  However, the store was vastly understaffed, and the employees had little autonomy"
good,I enjoy working at Lowe's. It has provided me with several opportunities to advance and do things that i enjoy.  The work is fast paced and the co-workers have fun and feel like family
good,"great work environment, management needs some help, trainings are so-so, jobs not hard but good customer interaction, by phone that is"

good,"Wanting to much from employees for what they are willing to pay."
good,"Pretty sure I already did this review.  Workplace was nice, lots of product information is needed as well as the ability to work with a team.  Better have a good pair of shoes otherwise your feet will hurt."
good,"I worked in the garden center, which I absolutely loved,. Lowes is a great company. They value their employees and many of the people at the store I worked at were 10+ years employees there. Lowes gives allowances for cook outs for every 60 days accident free. Felt very good to be appreciated!"
good,"I enjoyed working for the company. The company takes care of you, I would go back and work for them. the management staff is friendly and will guide you to success."
good,"I worked in the back in shipping and receiving building grills, lawnmowers, etc. Everyone i met was very nice and very helpful."
good,just not for fast moving people. get done with your work too fast then youre just walking around searching for something else to do.
good,I enjoy working here because the people are great and its a wonderful environment.  They trained me on the necessary equipment to do my job properly and gave me room to grow.
good,It was a very fast passed environment. Very well liked supervisor with great co-works. Every day brought new challenges and hard work
good,"If you are someone who seeks change and a fast pace environment, Lowe's is the place for you! I would highly recommend this job to someone who is wanting to advance from entry level retail jobs. Lowe's offers many opportunities to advance your career."
good,loved the job itselfand helping people with their home improvments.  just didn't like the way the management handled the part time employees.me and others as well were used and transferred all over the store. told we were going to get promoted to full time employees and it never happend
good,"A typical work day included working with customers, helping them find what they needed in the store and making sure the department was stocked.  I learned many different things.  There were no hard parts of this job.  The most enjoyable part of this job was driving power equipment."
good,Usually work from 10-3 on the days that I work. People are great to work with. The only thing I really don't like about working there is the house and pay. I don't seem to get enough hours during the week . I really enjoy getting to know and help customers.
good,"A typical day is ensuring customers are taken care of and your respective department well maintained. I have learned constantly in my 5 years with Lowe's, and came from part-time hardware associate to full-time Senior Kitchen Designer in under four years."
good,fun but productive managment is good all about saftey nice people learned a lot just working there i definently recommend working here
good,Hard work.. great times with employees and customers. but long hours and not enough money. Loved work though. not enough money
good,"Although I like working at Lowes, the repetitious nature of the job is too monotonous and boring.  Lowes, however, actively shows their employees their appreciation by shaking our hands when our shift is over and recognizing achievements"
good,overall great company just some management limits your forward progression to move up within. its hard to move up because not alot of movement within. they hire alot from outside instead of within promotions
good,"I loved working here, but fell ill that year and could no longer be an associate, so I resigned. I loved my co- workers and most managers, I loved my job duties, but it would get really slow sometimes, only downside"
good,"clock in, go to lumber work station, keeping area clean, helping customer to find what they are looking, cashiering mostly lots of team work."
good,"would help customers walking in with anything they needed as well as helping them out of the stoer doing anything from helping them find to product, to checking them out, and loading the items safely into the car."
good,"One can learn how to work in different systems that the company has and excel very much."
good,Great job.  I held many positions.  Schedule varied.  Shift Work.  I had more experience than most associates that worked there.
good,"If home improvement is your end career goal, Lowe's is a company that stands by its employees, and provides great benefits. Although the hours are flexing due to being retail, Lowe's overall was a great employer."
good,Its was a decent place to work... Didn't have much time for family life because of the scheduling not be consistent. Typical day would consist of helping customers special orders and so forth.
good,"Your typical day could include assisting customers in a variety of departments in the store, checking out customers, answering phones and looking up orders on a computer, and unloading the daily freight. A great company with fun and caring employees who make getting through tough day more enjoyable."
good,"I liked Lowes, it wasn't my favorite... The Customers was great also the Employee.. the job was fairly easy once you get a hang of it"
good,A typical day at work usually involved a wide range of challenges. providing good customer service requires attention to detail and the ability to communicate effectively with customers.
good,Lowes is a nice place to working as far as a retail jobs. Management is relaxed and understanding . I would highly recommend
good,Lowes is a good place to work and learn how to excel at doing things the right way. Safety is there first priority. Co-workers were always helpful for brand new employees in showing how things are done.
good,Good work environment and a good educational system and required training with good opportunities to work your way up the employment ladder.
good,Lowe's offers many benefits for their employees and their family members. Busy environment and multi tasking is a great skill to have in this environment.
good,"Management kept people happy, listened to concerns and did they're best to fix/accommodate. Stable hours, and if your willing they'll offer even more."
good,Had slow and busy days. Were able to take classes to learn about other areas of the business. Management changed quite often. Co-workers were very friendly. Hardest part was trying to stay busy when it was slow. We were allowed to joke around and have fun to make it easy for the customers.
good,Was a hard working job was not bad during the stocking hours some of the other workers were lazy and did not do their job seemed to be very hard to get fired was a decent summer job
good,Lowe's is a good company and offers excellent benefits.  Unfortunately some of the Area Staff are difficult to work with and somewhat condescending.
good,There is always something new to learn in Lowe's and the people are usually interested in help you to learn new trades.  Pay is good with good benefits.
good,Loved being able to be myself and have a good laugh with the other team members. Everyone helped one another out so it was a great opportunity. My boss is a very kind and professional man and I was very privileged to be able to have called him my boss. The hardest part of the job was when you had to do stocking.
good,"Very friendly staff, always there to help with questions, the training needs some improving but overall great impression with the company."
good,"Something new every day, good co - workers, problem solving, limited advancement, hardware, lawn and garden, paint, seasonal, lumber"
good,Learned everything about DIY home repair that you would want to know and more. Plus the pay was not bad at first. But after a while corporate found a way to cut commissions and overall pay and decided to tell us it was in our interest to do so. Many great sales people left soon after. Management is often cold or indifferent to their sales staff. Often people where working 3 or more departments simultaneously (my personal record was 6) because of chronic serious understaffing issues.
good,"Demonstrates leadership skills through collaborative efforts and the ability to influence and manage all performance levels through use of situational leadership, creating growth and opportunity for team members. Proven business acumen which has lead to increased and store margin while reducing shrink levels."
good,Really enjoyed working for Lowes. It is a great place to work. The employees are great to work with. Typical day for me would be helping customers and working outside in lawn and garden.
good,"I assisted Lowes customers in the plumbing and electrical department, stocked shelves, distributed incoming freight."
good,"Liked to work with others and assist customers locate certain items. It was moderately difficult physically, but not overwhelmingly so."
good,"•	Assisting customers with location and information of all merchandise on the floor"
good,"At this job a typical day would be answering phone calls, returning items, cashing out customers and stocking inventory. "
good,great place to great benefits great. mangement was great co workers was good to work with. a great laid back job with no up and down
good,Lowes is a company. Retail just like all other retail. I cant think of too much that would separate lowes from any other retail chain.
good,Working at Lowes was a great experience for me. I got to meet many new friends and learned how to deal with different varieties of customers and situations.
good,"Lower management were easy to talk to and usually very helpful, however the farther up the chain people were, the more ignorant they became to real problems during a typical day at work, and it was hard to talk to them about making improvements or any self advancement. Work environment otherwise was typically very friendly and other employees were easy to get along with. The benefits offered by this company were actually very good, however annual raises were barely enough to compensate for the time that management require you give to the job. Overall it was not a bad place to work through college, I learned very much and improved my interpersonal and multi-tasking skills, but ideally it is not an occupation or an environment that I wish to stay in for an extended period of time."
good,"Great place to work and a friendly environment, Very supportive company to work for. A typical day at work will consist of cleaning, making sure breaks and lunches go out on time. Management is very supportive and willing to help. From working in my position I've learned many things, such as cash handling, communication skills, great customer service skills as well. The hardest part of the job is when it is busy and the coverage is minimal. however there is always a way. The most enjoyable part to me is working with my co-workers they are great people and very supportive."
good,"Its all about who you know, especially in IT.  Poor overall management, but if you they like you they will look out for you.  If you make the wrong person mad, you will be stuck."
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowes the customers always made me want to come to work, the made it fun for me to come to work everyday."
good,"Lowe's has been my employer for the better part of a decade. I love the people I work with. Management can be scatterbrained at times. Communication is lacking. One manager will tell you one thing and another will tell you the complete opposite. The atmosphere is relaxed at times. I've learned time management, delegation and prioritizing from this job. A typical day includes stocking shelves, Customer Service, inventory management and cleaning. The hardest part of the job is covering several areas with no help."
good,"Management was always available"
good,Working for lowes was a great experience. i learned many skills from management to customer service and relations. Best part of the job was trying my associates to better their career.
good,"A typical day at Lowes starts and ends with the customer. Serving them in any way possible. Keeping the lines flowing and keeping the store and products presentable."
good,They really believe in a family atmosphere.  They are willing to work with schedules and family life.  They believe in making sure everyone is happy and want to give you the opportunity to advance
good,"I work with a lot of great people at Lowe's.Very flexible with schedule and pride ourselves on good communication through out the store.Enjoy that everyday is so different, such as working in different departments, team oriented tasks and also individual duties as requested."
good,"Flexible hours, management willing to work with most people.  some benefits even for part time and better than average basic pay."
good,aveces el ambiente y las responsabilidades de trabajo aumentaban y era mucha la carga para el empleado.
good,"Enjoyed working for lowes.  They are a dependable retail company to obtain employment for long periods of time.  Good Benfits, but it is retail, if you can handle the hours this is the retail you should be in."
good,fun work place with supportive management. Not all about number but how much you grow and develop. Most co workers are extremely friendly and helpfull.
good,"If you like toys or video games, then it's for you.  The holidays are crazy, but can also be fun.  After all, it is a toy store."
good,"There is always something to do to make your day go by fast.  You will learn how to be a better customer service person.  Once you learn how to do your job, you are able to help other, ""Love where they Live."
good,"When i first became employed at lowes, We had a different management. After I worked there for a while, we got a whole new management, and it wasn't that great. We definitely had a lot of issues with moving forward in the store, but overall the employees that i worked with were really great, and made up for the harsh work place that the management brought every day"
good,I love customer service so this job was a excellent fit for me I made lots of lasting with customers. When it comes down to it though the job quality depends on your community.
good,"ran leads all over state, long hours worked, very good compensation, not much family time, management was very good, great company to work for but lots of hours"
good,This was my first job. Learned lot of responsibility about having a job. My co-worker were very nice and help full. a typical day for me as a stocker was making sure the selves had plenty of stock and keep up with making the store look its best for our customers.
good,Very engaging environment. Everyone helpful and friendly. Great employee experience. They have multiple opportunities to grow with the company. Management is very involved from the General Manager down to the Training staff
good,"Very good company to work with but its depends on your location,I will recommend Lowe's as a good place to work if you enjoy working in retail."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work while going to college full time. They have flexible hours as long as you are part time. The pay is above average and you get raises every year. Moving up can take awhile. The people is what makes Lowe' most enjoyable. The lack of proper equipment to the job such as pallet jacks and personal protection equipment.
good,"Lowe's has most importantly improved my customer service and social skills. I usually serve up to 100 customers or more per day while doing load outs. This is the most enjoyable part of my job, being able to make relationships with the customers."
good,"The day consisted of replenishing stock and arranging to stock to be in an orderly fashion, while helping customers with questions about product, and assisting customers with helping hands."
good,"typical day at work is handling customers and product, I learned how deal with different situations and how to work other people."
good,"a decent place to work, average compensation. little room for growth, and little flexibility for improvement and self growth"
good,"Favorite place I ever worked"
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting customers stocking shelves and cleaning department before leaving. My co- workers were very hard working and family oriented. They made working very enjoyable ,as well as the customers, because they were so willing to help and teach you new things.The i really did not have any hard parts to my job and I say this because if it was hard I endured through it, with no fuss."
good,"Overall, a great company to work for. They take care of their employees ranging from a seasonal associate all the way up to senior management. Very high attention to detail when it comes to customer satisfaction."
good,It is great working here but can't really test my abilities to do certain things being that I stand at the cash register but I am able to show some of my technology skills.
good,Not a bad place at all. Rotating shifts kind of difficult to deal with. Opening the day after you close is tough to get used to.
good,Lowe's gives you an opportunity to grow within the company. The company is aggressive in terms of profit acquisition. Politics play a large role in your success within the team. Everyday is filled with constant customer interaction and never seems like there is a dull moment. I am ready to seek in new opportunities to expand my career horizons.
good,I worked with a verity of materials. Working with different machines; Most notable the fork lifts. Very long nights.  But good time.
good,"My goal is to help my client accomplish what it was that first brings them to me. It gives me great joy to be the reason a person walks away feeling accomplished, secure, and smiling. Working with all the other employees is usually a very nice experience, and you will never really go around in great need of help because there is always someone near by who is willing to help."
good,"Goal driven company, but still a fun atmosphere. Managers are friendly and have great attitudes towards customers and their employees."
good,"I assisted customers with their requests; stock recovery during the slow periods. I learned all about the features and benefits of the various tools, nails, screws ,etc. from my customers and co-workers. Management was always available and helpful. The hardest part of the job was not being able to provide the needs of the customer; the most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customers needs."
good,Lowes Home Centers is a fun and exciting work place. I have been able to advance in the company rather quickly.  Management and co workers are very helpful and knowledgeable.
good,Co- workers were outgoing friendly and fun to work with. Management was fairly supportive. The work hours were ideal for the management position I held.
good,"Everyone has to get ready for the day, greeted customers, cash handling, customer service."
good,"I learned about every department in the Store, built great relationships with Department Managers. More hands-on with customers. Was able to report suspicious behavior to Upper Management and Lose Prevention."
good,"Responsible for the schedules of the other operators, paperwork for the management and worked as the HR specialist. worked different hours. I felt I worked for the employees and the company would benefit."
good,"Worked as a seasonal associate. If you have experience in ustomer service and knowledge in home improvement, this company is right for you."
good,Excellent place to work. Great benefits and very understanding management. I need first shift and the only way to advance is to work swing shift.
good,worked in many departments and had an opportunity to learn many different jobs and gained knowledge of most departments.
good,"Providing the customer with exceptional service includes not only have a good attitude, but understanding what the customer needs and providing good service by asking the right questions."
good,Great customers and rewarding experience.  Busy store.  Great learning experience. Work hard and receive SSEI Bonus. Would encourage applying.
good,Great part time job for college students. All of the workers were very good people since we were all similar in age. management would sometimes get on you just to get on you even though you were the one hustling and working your tail off. I would go in to work and would be discouraged by management since they would call on me to do a lot of things since i was always willing to do it rather than distribute the work upon all the workers. This seemingly made me want to put less effort at the job.
good,"Good pay, Good benefits, and my favorite part is the co-workers. I worked my butt off but was never seen as a prospect for management or a higher paying position due to my age."
good,"The work is physically demanding, and the management is demanding on your time. However, they have a great policy that you get one weekend, meaning Saturday/Sunday, off every month."
good,Fun work place with supportive management not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics.
good,"A typical evening at work for me would be, cashing customers out, helping the customers load up their lumber and drywall, cleaning my area, answering the pro desks phones, answering questions, giving prices, cleaning up some of the lumber area and finding someone to help the customers with the things I do not know."
good,"Continuous customer service with a professional team of employees and managers. Daily challenges included delivery issues to inventory issues, which made a typical day prove to be gratifying upon solving the daily concerns."
good,"Lowes is a great company that offers many routes in how to shape your career. I started as a seasonal associate. With the right guidance from management they were able to help me grow from seasonal to full time associate and then a full time Sales Specialist. They have internal growth so they don't forget the associates that work with them, day in and day out."
good,"This is a place I enjoy working because I have much interest in home improvement projects for myself and others. I feel this is somewhere I can learn and grow. A typical day is very busy but productive. The hardest part of the job is not getting enough hours, which would push me to seek other employment even though I may not want to, The most enjoyable part is my co workers. We work as a team and help out where help is needed."
good,"Working at Lowe's was a great experience."
good,"I enjoyed my work experience at the job centre its a nice friendly environment to work in, and it was good to see how the work place runs."
good,"While customer service is the heart beat of any business, Lowes is as much tasking as is customer service.  I strive to let the customer know they are much appreciated and want their business and loyality."
good,"was my first job, learned a lot of skills and was able to advance from cashier into management. It's still fast food and has its down sides like late hours working and your constantly rushing all the time."
good,"Store manager is extremely nice, but does not delegate properly, which leads to a lot of scheduling errors and shortages of staff."
good,Company is structured well and likes to promote from within. Good benefits. Positive work environment. Management easy to work with.
good,"The management was very friendly at Lowe's, and coworkers also helped you get through the day. The culture that Lowe's strives for helps customer and employee interaction"
good,"This wasn't just another retail job. People from my community would seek me out, regardless of which department they needed. It made me feel good to know that people were still asking about me, years after I left Lowe's."
good,Coworkers were great and the customers were easy to handle. The lumber was heavy and you need muscles to do the job. Also good training involved on Lowes part.
good,Typical day at work was helping customers with merchandise and making they were satisfied.  We had a very pleasant working atmosphere.
good,Just like with any multi billion dollar corporation there are issues that are out of the store level control.  For the most part the store was an enjoyable place to work.  I gained not just friends but family from my time there and including meeting my wife which I will be forever greatful.  Days were usually pretty hectic but you get through it.  I wouldn't want to drop the ball and have to have someone pick up after me.  Management and myself had a really good relationship.  Always had an open door.  The others that I worked with I couldn't say a bad word about.  It was a good team/family at the store.  What was hardest for me there was the level of dishonesty some will go to get a discount or something free but in the same breath the best part for me was helping someone from start to stop and see the smile on their face as it comes to an end and its better than they expected.
good,"a typical day at work consist of stocking, helping guest, and maintaining clean and safe areas, which is the best part of the job"
good,Work day consists of the same basic tasks everyday. I learned a lot about the garden center as well as all other departments in the store from employees as well as customers. Hardest part is dealing with the customers. most enjoyable is the benefits that pay off for dealing with the customers.
good,It is an good company to work for.  I work Return/Customer Service Desk.  There are awesome managers and some dedicated workers.
good,"A typical day at work was working 8+ hours a day on the register, my co workers are what made the job enjoyable, the hardest part was constantly being pushed for credit and extended warranties and barely getting any time off even being part time."
good,good growth potential and work load. mid management was a little disorganized and inconsistent. plus employee moral was very low not sure how it is now tho
good,hard work but meet great people did not like the hours. working to 11 pm then getting to be at work at 0600. one week end off a month when you were lucky. if you got the week end off you worked till 11 pm and had to be back Monday at 0600.
good,"I learned a varied skill set which enabled me to gain certifications in forklift, order picker, & narrow isle reach truck equipment. Great environment for entry level positions."
good,"I'd rather not give a review of Lowes, it would be to time consuming and be of little benefit to me, the company or anyone else."
good,Been working at Lowe's for over 8 years and I personally consider it as a second home together with great people to work with. I have learned so much working for the company but I am ready to use my knowledge in other areas.
good,"Typical 8 hour work day a 1 hour lunch, compassionate/great co workers to solve problems on the job and to chit chat with  Most enjoyable part of job is getting to know the customers and hearing their personal experiences with items and equipment in your store hardest part is the amount of lifting you do you will feel exhausted by the end of your shift"
good,was nice working and meeting new people everyday.liked helping people.was nice to be out on your own.hardest part of the job was having someone new alot of times ..its hard to train someone when they are out in the field doing things and they are your only help.
good,"I really enjoyed working with the associates and developing my skills as a CSM.  The company has a Love where you Work philosophy; however, at this specific location it was hard.  The other two locations I worked at were awesome, team orientated, great management and followed the Lowe's way and policy/procedures for the whole company."
good,learned alot about things in a hardware store and alot about plants while i was there. i just could not take all the passive aggressivness from upper management.
good,"I worked many jobs throughout my experience at Lowe's. However, my typical day consisted in helping customers, preparing financial reports for my department, and clean up my department to the best of my ability. I enjoyed interaction with employees as well customers. Lowe's taught me how to become successful with my management skills along with learning new communication skills. The hardest part of my job was adjusting with low coverage; however, we constantly found new ways of handling the issues. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping others and accomplishing goals. Overall, it was a great experience for me."
good,"I appreciate so much about this company and all that I learned. I have so many opportunities. However Family life is impossible and"
good,"It has been some years since I've worked here, but I did enjoy the opportunity to talk with customers, meet their needs, guide them to products, and to give information and options for their home projects.  The atmosphere is very positive among the employees, and the morning meetings can be fun and informative.  I was a cashier, but if I wanted to learn about flooring, or paint, or any other department, there was plenty of opportunity to do so."
good,"Its a good place to work, although it can be random sometimes. There is more balance for those with permanent full time status. Its a retail job, so certain things are expected"
good,Lowe's pays better than some of the retail business and their work environment is fair enough. There is some opportunity for improvement for employees.
good,Overall it was great the managers was great and concern about the employee's. Learn alot and well train in my department.
good,A typical day at work is taking care of all customer needs and scheduling cashiers breaks and lunches. can be a very challenging job some days but is very rewarding.

good,"The morning start with a Department Information Meeting (DIM), where we review information from the day before, and then discuss what we have going on for the day. Address crewing needs of the plant with other supervisors and then get started with daily production."
good,As a cashier I would operate the register while providing excellent customer service. Both my coworkers and management were very understanding.
good,"I have worked for Lowe's since 1997. Lowe's bought out the Eagle Store I worked in, in 2000. I have worked in the following departments. Paint and Home Décor, Inside Lawn and Garden and Hardware and Tools. In all of my years working for Lowes I have been engaged in Lowes mission statement of offering as much of my expert customer service but now that I am 65 I would like to find a new job which is less physical"

good,"We would have communication huddles with all team members in the morning to go over sale goals for the day, all current promotions, and  programs and processes to restock store. "
good,"A typical day involved checking out customers, providing excellent customer service, team work, answering phones.  I learned how to easily adapt to different environments and situations that evolved in retail and how to effectively handle them. I also learned how to excel in my job and get customers in and out quickly. Management handled situations I could not and helped when needed. The hardest part of the job was making angry customers happy when they were set on what they wanted. The most enjoyable part was the people I was surrounded by everyday. The customers I got to know and my fellow co-workers made each day good and fun."
good,"I was hired as part time seasonal."
good,Hectic work schedule. Self training for the most part. Not everyone has a good work ethic and no punishment for slackers. Extremely physical work.
good,I developed marketing and merchandising skills along with problem solving skills.  Each reset has its own challenges.  I have learned to approach each set with the proper strategy to execute the reset with the end result being showroom ready.

good,"loading and unloading plants, bricks and other outdoor items into customers cars. Watering plants, helping customers in aisles."
good,"The job hasn't been too bad, but I've had better. The pay is good, but the hours make it impossible to have a life outside of work. It's next to impossible to plan anything without burning a vacation day or calling in. The work itself isn't too bad."
good,Great people to work with.  Great customer service.  Get to be involved in any area of the store.  Great benefits.  Enjoy my time even with the stress of the season!
good,"I typically answer fifty to a hundred calls a day for Lowe's call center . I started at Lowe's working in triage department and work my way up to working the software were I take calls from Lowe's employees that are having technical issues with the software on the registers, terminal, PCs, and printers of Lowe's."
good,Working at Lowe's is a job. Unless you are in Management. I knew some who had been there many years and felt trapped. The pay is fair for the work. Hours are retail. Unless you love home improvement or need a job Lowe's is a good start.
good,"Job is fast paced and rewarding.  Can be hard to find good qualified help.  Bonus structure is good, excellent vacation pay"
good,"Great career builder and amazing opportunities to exploring your options as a customer service representative. "
good,"The company is an excellent company to work for."

good,"This was a Seasonal position while i was there i learned;"
good,"I am in management and it requires me to be on the move constantly."
good,"A typical day at work is assisting customers with all their shopping needs. As a front end cashier, I work in the lumber department, front end casher, and Garden Center. I work will really great co-workers that are always willing to help me out if I don't know how to do something. The management is very flexible will scheduling. The best part of my job is just helping customers."
good,"Very Good work place . Easy going ,typical day greet customer, handling money , solving customer issues. "
good,I enjoyed working at lowe's. It was fun. I learned a lot in a short period of time and not just about work. About stuff i could do in my home. And i loved the customers. They made the job so much more fun!

good,"I have learned a lot working for Lowes such as customer service skills, product knowledge and certain abilities that I posses. My typical day at work is being friendly to customers and understanding there needs. I also work with a group of knowledgable individuals who have been in the business for years."
good,many opportunities to move up within Lowes as a part timer. Its very hard to get a full time position. I been with Lowes for a little over a year and i have been promoted 3 times as a part timer. Still trying to get a full time position within the company.
good,"On a typical day, I would come in and look for a work list if listed by the department manager, then go and put away stock and start working on the task list that was assigned to me. Customer service is number one, so I would stop what I am doing to help customers get their merchandise or answer questions."
good,"Good management"
good,"My typical day of work included cleaning all paint machines, putting away inventory, organizing inventory, assisting customers and other coworkers, and mixing paint."
good,"A typical day is making sure that the store is looking good inside and out. By sweeping and mopping floors, washing windows, tables, chairs and mirrors and emptying garbage where needed. The best part is knowing that I have taken care of everything needed to be done at the end of the day."
good,"It has been over five years since I've worked there, so this will be very short and sweet. Everything about the company was great...the atmosphere, people, compensation and benefits, culture, and professionalism. The only negative thing I could say is that trying to improve a process by changing it was like trying to wake a sleeping giant. It is, obviously, very corporate and there are many levels to go through to obtain desired changes. Unfortunately, the guys at the bottom are usually the ones who know the most about the day-to-day operation. It is important that their voice be heard."
good,"My work family is great, they are supportive and provide a positive atmosphere. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that I helped somebody by offering them knowledge or the time to explain something thoroughly."
good,"Working daily with customers and other employees."
good,Lowe's is the best one stop shopping experience for all first time home owners.  Working for Lowe's provided me with a friendly work environment and showed opportunity for team work as well as social development.
good,Great group of people to work with. It is enjoyable helping people love where they live. Opportunities for advancement.
good,"Daily at Lowe's we a team of 6 in a department, would apply customer service skills to treat and serve customers. We would help in any areas of need or question. Our other task include stocking and maintenance of the department. We had four managers above us in each department, and as a team we would all ensure that the store in total was prepared for success. Great environment with a sense of hard work and dedication, and with it being a home improvement store you get the feeling of a home environment with the team you work with."
good,"Lowes is typically a fast-paced work environment, and is very stressful. There is not a lot of time for breaks. Management is very particular and overzealous."
good,"If you're just starting out, then this is a wonderful place to work. I enjoyed the time I worked here. Management is wonderful, but there's not much room to advance."
good,"There is always someone who needs help and things to get done in the building. Co-workers are great and friendly. Management is great, always on top of things."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work and learn skills, but it is simply a stepping stone for people who have strong management skills and are self starters.  For these people, the bordeom will catch up with them and they will find themselves seeking other opportunities."
good,"Worked with heavy machinery to stock and bring down appliances, as well as sell appliances to questioning customers."
good,"You're typical big box corporation. Long hours that vary in terms of the time of day. Customers can be very hard headed, which should be expected."
good,"Reviewing email, customer weekly review, project analyses, quote creation, special orders, and submitting invoices,"
good,A typical day would require standing for 4 - 5 hours at a time and cashing out customers in a timely manner. The job was easy to pick up and there was not much difficulty. Management is relaxed and does not make the job feel stressful.
good,"good job have fun, take care of customers and go home I already wrote a more detailed review earlier and dont feel like writting it again"
good,"I like my experience at Lowes.  They worked with me on schedules, and taught me a lot about the positions I held.  Also allowed for limited travel opportunities if desired, for which I was compensated well."
good,"As a girl working in the lumber dept my job was a bit challenging but i enjoyed the customer interactions and my co-workers were helpful in times i could not lift heavy items alone. iIlearned how to use a panel saw and became really good at precisely cutting boards to customers specifications. Over the summer in our busy season it was hot and there was a lot of work to be done, but i worked with a wonderful team and we made it through each day together."
good,I learned more about tools and products and what they were used for and how they were used. a day at work i would assist customers with finding anything or cutting wood and loading customer vehicles.
good,"My typical day consists for going in, checking email and beginning to build.Overall I enjoy my job and for the most part I like my management team. There is unfortunately a significant amount of what could be considered ""high school drama"" to be had there. They hire many 18-25 year old associates which can cause a rumor mill but if you do your work there is rarely a problem."
good,learned a lot with tools and days at work would be great due to the people working there. most enjoyable part of the job is learning something new on the job or about the job.
good,"Helping a handful of customers in several departments, using power equipment."
good,"typical day at work, you clock in best way is to clock in about 7-9 mins before shift. go to your locker and grab your vest. Then head to the Head Cashier and ask them where you're needed. You will spend the day at one of these register locations: Front end, Self-checkout, Outside Garden center, Inside Lumber Yard (Commerical Services desk), or the customer service/returns desk. typical shift for full time cashiers are 8 hour to 9 hour shifts with an hour lunch break and a 15 min break. for part timers it varies from 5 hour shifts to 7 or."
good,"I never had a problem with Lowes' culture or policies. But as with most jobs, poor management store level can really make a job unbearable."
good,"Great place to work.  Fun and challenging sales environment, with lots of opportunity to grow.  I felt very valued as an employee."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company. Management seemed concerned for employee well-being, being flexible whenever possible. The company also succeeds in recognizing the value of internal mobility (i.e. promotions from within)."
good,my day use to start with greetings each other and then customers. After all that dedicating myself to work then go home safely.
good,it was a good place to work nice people to work nice boss hours suck really bad great place for younger people or retired people
good,I enjoyed working here. I loved my co-workers and the management. I liked multitasking and helping customers. I worked in different departments and learned about different products to better help customers.
good,A typical day would be upon arrival review the tasks that need to be completed and any preventive maintenance that needs to be performed.
good,Worked around great people and enjoyed my time there. Helped me learn what it took to give great customer service. I will always remember all the people i helped at that store.
good,Working at lowe's is enjoyable a typical day is interesting because you never know who you will meet or what will happen. I learned organizational skills and product information. Management were good to all of there employees and were always there to help. The co-workers were great to be around. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with all of the orders. The most enjoyable part was helping people and knowing you did them a favor by teaching them and showing them the right thing to do and buy.
good,"Lowe's is a great place for fresh out of college or new to the corporate culture employees.  Its an interesting ever changing environment just on the cutting edge of putting new technology in place in needed areas.  A great place to learn new skills, network and build on your education."
good,They have great ability to move up in the company and the mangers were always willing to help when needed. The skills of the specialists was always helpful
good,"Deal with lots of customers on a daily basis.  "
good,Coworkers were great.  Store Management was suffering.  The attitude of the store was very low.  Lowes is a good company
good,good job ..long days but worth it ..good company..get good food people r nice
good,"Every day had its own challenges. I enjoyed engaging customers, but because of our smaller staff, it was difficult to keep up with store stock levels, store cleanliness, and making sure that all of the customers were helped in a timely fashion. Generally, the management staff wanted to help get things done and find solutions, as well as some of the employees. I think that the most fun part of the job was the ability to find people good, quality products for less than they would expect. The most difficult part was the lack of training and motivation across the board from some of the employees. It was hard to get help in other areas or to get some newer people trained when they first started."
good,so many opportunities. the training is endless and the possibilities are infinite.
good,"Helping the public with home improvement projects. Learning how to multi-task in a fast pace environment while staying customer focused. Management was OK during my time with Lowe's, I am sure the same could be said about any retail environment. I had great co-workers, many of which have turned into life time friends. The schedule was never stable, changed week to week. Working with great people was the best part of the job."
good,"Lowe's is a fast pace, high volume store that provides excellent customer service. From store manager down to the Customer Service Associates, all members of the Lowe's team work hard and are dedicated to providing excellent customer service. The hardest part of working in the lumber department would be the physical part, but all the lumber associates put in 150% to provide customer satisfaction. The best part of working at Lowe's is knowing that every customer leaves happy and appreciates our hard work."
good,"Unloaded freight truck, fun and challenging at the same time."
good,company over all was ok but the pay was lacking. I was able to learn many things over the years and loved the ultimate great customer service. The company has under go many changes over the years and hopefully for the better. Over all I enjoyed working for the company.
good,"Customer service, upbeat busy atmosphere. Fun location to work but consistent in expectations and customers. Fast cashier skills as well as knowing the store as well as the customers."
good,The hardest part of my day is when I am unable to answer a question for a customer. I go through many channels to try to get the answers I feel they deserve. I do enjoy meeting new people and providing positive customer service 100% of the time. It is a great feeling when you can leave someone smiling and knowing that you have done your job great.
good,"A typical day at work for me includes managing a list of 35+ accounts that need to be grown every month. These accounts are our top accounts for the store that bring in the most amount of sales. My list of accounts makes up over $1 million of sales per year. I work in a group of 4 other guys who also have their own list of 35 accounts. While I manage this list I am also working with customers who come into the store looking for guidance. As a Sales Specialist in ProServices, you are expected to know every department of the store inside and out. If someone wants to know about flooring, you need to help them, point blank. "
good,"Good job, good training, good people, good benefits, learned a lot."
good,This company provides nice opportunists to work part time or full time but does not provide much room to move up the ladder but has a low ceiling
good,Easy work. Just come do your job and you'll be fine. Great benefits for part-time and full-time associates. Just wish they would give the part timers more than the 25 hours a week.
good,"Working at Lowe's has taught me many valuable lessons such as how to communicate with people, customer service, and how to sell products. It is a fast pace place to work at, with very little down time if any. Customers are always looking for assistance with their projects and we are there to help. The best part of the job is the people who work there, they all have a positive attitude and are hard workers."
good,"This was a wonderful company to work for. American Eagle was my dream job! However, when sitting down after my first year there for my review, I was told that there was no advancement or pay raise associated with the route I was doing. This was so frustrating. I did however, love this job so much, that I just told myself to wait out for a different route to open up. Before that could happen, new management came in, told me I wasn't servicing one of my stores enough (which was the FIRST time I had heard this), and that I was being let go. It was unfair. Especially when I received the top bonus checks I possibly could each month. Gosh, I wish I could have stayed here. It really was a wonderful place to work! I miss it so much!"
good,Prepared deposits for the store. Customer Service and cashier for the rest of the day.
good,Good company to work for. Benefits not all that good. Room for growth.
good,Its an enjoyable mostly fast paced environment. I've learned patience as well as many office skills
good,Great place to work depending on the store.  Every store is it's own environment.  Good benefits and chance for advancement if working on store management side.  Employees work together and go out of their way to provide the best customer service they can.
good,"I enjoy working here and like the people I interact with, both co-workers and the public."
good,"At lowes I would provide customer service and help where I was needed. I learned about merchandising, management how to be the best in every area of customer satisfaction possible,"
good,Loved my coworkers and my customers. Working at lowes was the easiest job I've ever had.
good,"On a typical day I would be assisting customers with payments, returns, exchanges or purchasing items. The co-workers are easy to get along with and nice which makes for a good place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help someone with their problems and keep them coming back."
good,"In Loss Prevention we would perform countless audits, reviews, check and balances to ensure store's profitability. The store personnel were truly wonderful to work along side, though we were technically removed from the store for investigative purposes."
good,All the employees were very friendly and helpful. If I had a question they were there to help.
good,Great Place to learn about Home Improvement and proper way to handle customer service
good,"On any given day, I maintain the appearance of the lumber canopy via stocking concrete, drywall, and OSB as well as giving it a daily thorough cleaning.  Depending on staffing, most days I end up inside zoning the sales floor, stocking shelves and cantilevers, and driving power equipment.  Most of my daily activities revolve around customers."
good,"Lowes offers great benefits for part time employees in comparison to other companies. My experience at my store in particular was good because management always worked with my schedule while I was in school and when I had my daughter. They rely a little too much on computer based training, but otherwise managers are happy to coach team members something new."
good,"As a sales associate I was responsible for providing quick, friendly customer service by answering customers questions, providing purchase assistance and keeping shelves stocked. Assigned primarily to one zone on the sales floor, but may be required to work in other areas. I worked in lumber, building materials and millworks department."
good,Fast growing company dedicated in teaching and training associates to take care of the customer.
good,Employees make an effort to be as efficient as possible while provided a positive experience for customers.
good,A typical day  at work consists of helping customers find what they need to improve their home project.
good,I would say that working at Lowe's did teach me a lot. I love to work where I am able to meet new people and am able to give a helping hand to others. This job also has its ups and downs the management was very poor and due to that I was let go of this job after 3 years
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work.  It's been fun being back in the stores after not being able to find a paralegal or admin job after I obtained my paralegal certificate and took Microsoft Office training.  The last time I did this I was in High School."
good,Typical Day is helping customers with your few employees who rather not work. Typical Retail.
good,"The job itself was not bad, just hard to promote up with ok benefits."
good,"Fast paced work place - Frequent vendors workshop and product update are the excellent sources of learning new technology and products."
good,"my typical day at work was helping customers with what they needed and ringing people up for cashier work. I learned that customers have there bad days and so does everybody, mostly this job wasn't for me don't get me wrong I loved working with the customers 100 percent but my coworkers never worked as a team"
good,"I have been with Lowe's for seven and a half years, and I can truly say I have learned a lot within the retail field.  My typical day of work includes running a cash register and using great customer service skills to help patrons to the best of my abilities.  The only downside is standing for long hours, however my managers are fair with giving their employees breaks.  My most enjoyable part of the job is working with my great co-workers and constantly meeting new people."
good,Possibilities to move up the ladder are endless. Flexible scheduling and management is there for you whenever you need them.
good,Work is hard but pay is well worth it.  Especially if you are a college student.
good,i really think lowes is a great productive company with employees that work as a team.
good,moving stock all over store and puting in proper destinations
good,Good place to work. room for advancement. retail hours nights and weekends.
good,"Early start at work with filing paper work auditing Order Management, and ensuring product is ready for our Installers to pick up. Taking and making calls whether to resolve situations with installers, vendors and/or customers. Constantly updating customers on their install project progress. The biggest challenge of the day is to ensure all parties are happy and working together, such as the Installers, co-workers, Customer's and vendors. When involved with a situation which takes management guidance, our Install Sales Team has great support in handling more difficult situations. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the group of women in the office and helping customer's with their remodels, no matter how large or small the project is. When customers express their gratitude, it feels great to be part of a project that has made them so happy."
good,"Daily I was responsible for customer assistance, stocking shelves, and assisting with all departments. Learned about different types of building material and how to assist customers when they had questions regarding needed materials. I worked with several departments at Lowes and enjoyed getting to work with other team mates. I enjoyed the experience working with this company but needed to find a job that I could move up in."
good,60 hour weeks/1.3M Budget/Excellent Compenstaion Package/Multi-layer Management Somewhat Effective/Computer Systems Need Improvement/Co-workers & Peers Supportive
good,Very well organized and nice place to work but unless you are a sales specialist there is no room for growth within the company and you could be in your current position for your career. The most enjoyable part of the job is just a sense of accomplishment in completing your daily tasks the hardest part is that everyone on the job is manual labor dedicated and you're often left to go behind them and complete their tasks.
good,If you don't know information just ask anyone and they will tell you. Hardest working people Ive ever met.
good,If you love to wake up early mornings (around 3:00am) this is the job for you.  Little oversight from supervisors.  A lot of moving around and heavy lifting.
good,"I would stock shelves early before the busiest part of the day began. I would work on scheduling, ordering, taking care of customers. All my co-workers took pride in our department and kept it very clean and we made sure that we always helped the customer."
good,Great company to work for and loved the fast paced environment that I went into each day.
good,"Great place to work, a very big team in every store.  If any problems occur there is always management and HR to assist you and help you get through them."

good,I loved working here because the management really cared and was very nice. I liked that I was sometimes outside and the employees were awesome.
good,"-Typical day at work requires heavy lifting or moving of heavy objects from 100lbs - 500lbs, also interacting and serving customers the best of my ability."
good,Management provided profound support. Most enjoyable part of the job was the workers and team atmosphere. Learned product knowledge and heightened customer focus
good,"I worked for Lowes retail, for 2 years - working in menswear."
good,I like working for Lowe's. Most of the jobs there are easy but a lot of the scheduling is awful. Some of the workers called each other names behind others backs. Very childish. Management acted like they were better than you... They did not follow procedures correctly but punished you as a worker if you didn't follow them.
good,"Lowes Home Improvement was a fun place to work.."
good,A typical day at Lowes was pretty fast paced. we were always on our feet helping and checking out customers. The management was very helpful when it came to needing help. Hardest part was dealing with the angry customers.
good,"I learned that after 10 years of retail, 3 of it at Lowe's that even though I was great at it I was miserable."
good,"Most everyone was really nice, the work was tough sometimes but they tried their best to take care of their employees."
good,"This was the best place for me to have worked. My work ethic really changed in this place, I went from being relaxed and polite, to being relaxed and polite... but moving faster and getting more done. Management was great and my coworkers were the best. Since I left, they haven't considered my for another position in my new town, but I'd definitely work there again."
good,"very friendly co workers"
good,"Good job, great people. Just had it to save money. People were cool. I really haven't worked there in years."
good,get to meet a lot of people and a good variety of situations just unstable work hours and days makes it hard on a family person
good,"You have to work hard everyday, but it's worth it.  You learn to deal with a lot of different people, to be flexible, and to solve problems efficiently."
good,"Maximize sales of departments  merchandise and related products. Maintaine  the     departments according to company merchandising standards and store operations policies. Ensure  that all merchandising and operational activities take place on a consistent basis. Provide and ensure quick, responsive, friendly customer service."
good,"received and created charts for clients "
good,I really enjoyed being a cashier.I learned to be more outgoing.The management were ok.There was one supervisor who was not too nice and not enjoyable to work with at all but I guess that could happen anywhere.
good,A day is full of customer satisfaction and learning the different levels of such.  A person must build on ones own character to advance in this type of job.  The fellow employees are enjoyment to work with and play their part everyday in fullfilling Lowes mission.
good,"Down stock some items to fill the empty holes, help customer to find the right hardware or tool for there project."
good,I had a good time while I was there. The friendships that you build is what makes the difference. I loved serving customers who were nice and appreciated what you did.
good,Great place to work. Need more hours. Upbeat management. Decent pay.
good,Great training camp for anyone wanting to learn about the basic of customer service - A university within itself.
good,I enjoyed my time at lowes great work environment with great people
good,"Not the worst place to work depending on which location"
good,Customer service says it all. It is a customer service business and that's what keeps the doors open
good,"I loved working here. Its a great first job to have. You learn more than just helping customers out, you learn about them."
good,I have worked for two lowes. this was my 2nd lowes and this was way better then the one in mount Pocono which was a new one. this one has been around longer and the management was way better.
good,I loved our family atmosphere and our ability to work together. Managers were easy to talk to as well as coworkers.
good,"Normal workday with friendly people"
good,"Always moving around, constant help for costumers, answering phones, assistant other co-workers."
good,"I can honestly say that the majority of my coworkers at Lowes were good friends and are still very close to me. I can go in there today and still get stopped by the same friendly faces. That is what I miss most of all. No matter what I was working on or where I was, there was always someone that had something nice to say to me. I learned that even thought there are people that are only out for themselves, there are still kind and caring people that would drop everything to help out. The hardest part of my job was being away from my family and that is why I am searching for a work from home job that will allow me to stay close to them. There is nothing greater than being able to provide for family while being close to them at the same time."
good,"It was an OK place to work."
good,great place to work. good pay and good benefits. I loved working with all the great people
good,Never a boring day. Great Customer's. On the job training is fantastic.
good,Everyone works together to get the job done  from office people to the cashier. great team great job
good,"A typical day was just working hands on with customers, and running the front end properly."
good,"Most days go by smoothly, but on those off days its worse then being in grade school with bullies. You have those that really try to do the job at hand and some get the chance to do it and do it well. But most often then not middle and upper management couldnt care any less about the employees. "
good,"Pretty fun, good exercise, talk to people, get some sun, smell the roses, DRIVE A FORKLIFT."
good,"Serviced customers in a number of ways including cashiering, finding products sought after in any department, and preforming cutting services. The managers were pleasant to work with, boosting confidence and helping you push you to the next level of employment at lowes."
good,Providing all the benefits they give - it is a pretty awesome place to look for. but dont let them fool you - it is harder work than you would think. especially if you are thrown out on the floor before being properly trained.
good,"Since as i currently work nightshifts i would have to say thats one of the hardest parts. I am order picker as well as reach truck trained i do mostly the big boxing top stocking, throwing up pallets also bringing them down."
good,pretty good job.  lots of opportunity to move up if you work hard and follow the rules.  very hard to get hired full time.  lots of politics involved
good,"3 stars, its ok.  I personally wouldn't want to work there for more than a year, but honestly if I could, I wouldn't work at all..."
good,"A typical day for me would be to go in and review the safety aspects of the store, walking the perimeter and training any associates I come into contact with. Next thing would be to review the previous days shrink as well as review and research any previous days discrepancies such as  inventory, accidents, training issues that arise and etc. I then manage my day based on needs of the store and also attempting to investigate internal/external activity as well as train associates on shrink related programs throughout the day."
good,Hardest part of this job is the retail hours and schedule.  Expect to have no life and no family time.
good,Good self learning opportunities but poor career development from management.
good,"•	Cashier "

good,Good place to work just ready for a change of pace management was pretty good with helping in times of need and dept. managers were always very knowledgeable of their areas.
good,Everything was good about working here nice paced and fair pay
good,"Decent place to work. Rotating schedule can be very trying at times, but is unavoidable in a retail environment. I am blessed to have a position in which I have a set Mon-Fri 6-3 schedule. Can't complain much at all. More often than not, I come to work clean and leave clean. However, I leave plenty of days sweat soaked; my job is physically active and demanding at times. The only downfall is the quality of senior management, considering the amount of training that  the company puts these higher level managers through. Its almost as though it was for nothing. I suppose that is something you get in any work environment."
good,"Great place to work. Great place to advance your career."
good,i learned how to be safe. the job was basically the same routine daily.
good,Everyday was kind of new. Typically consisted of assisting customers and operating power equipment
good,"Great working environment, family-like company. Compensation is not very good depending on the job"
good,"This place was easy going and a lot of fun to work for. I loved Lowes and Wish I could return however once you quit they don't want too pay what they originally paid you. However that wasn't even my issue. I applied and was told ""im over qualified"" its ridiculous. Anyways, great place but crazy hours and good pay too."
good,It is slow most of the year and basic retail.  Gets really busy in the 4th quarter and you work alot then.

good,"Stocking Shelves"
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for. Working with nice and helpful people is a bonus.
good,"Balance bank cash and teller units on a daily basis. "
good,"A typical day at work would be: greeting and working with customers to provide the best shopping experience possible, I learned many different things using the computer: looking up accounts, Processing phone and internet orders. Management was not very supportive, very condescending, you never felt you were good enough. Coworkers were a great support system always ready to help. the hardest part of the job was the constant insults from management not just toward me but others as well. The best part of the job was seeing happy satisfied customers."
good,"This is a wonderful company to work for. I work in Wilkesboro NC and enjoy the daily activities of my job duties. Working with different vendors, US broker."
good,Good company to work for.  Great benefits and pay is better than most.

good,I enjoy working with my coworkers and interacting with the public
good,Really liked the job and the atmoshere stayed very busy loved the customers
good,"It is very hard work, a lot of heavy lifting, at a very fast pace,The people are great for the most part, although we are doing a lot of OT and you can tell when people are starting to get grumpy. The worst thing is the extreme heat or cold. In a warehouse the language is pretty bad, and the dust and dirt gets to you."
good,Ok but a different Job with no real rules at times or slowly learning it slowly...
good,Typical place to work. they do treat their part time employees better then most places
good,"Lowe's was my first job.  I began when I was a college sophomore and continued well after graduating.  The worked with me throughout school to accommodate me class schedule, and taught me everything I needed to know to work there."
good,Direct the associates to close customers. Stay in stock.Operations focused company. management is fair. Enjoyed the special order customer service.
good,Lowes is a cool place to work if you are a student or without a degree of some sort. The store allows many to earn a comfortable living by following guidelines and taking direction. Not bad.

good,Friendly customers and coworkers. Enjoyed company cook outs
good,Lowes is a great place to work. Althought there are days where the senior management team lacks support to there employees.
good,"Great place to work, the people are great, and so is the atmosphere. The only thing is the nights, I don't mind working the 40+ hours, however I am looking for a day shift."
good,Great company to work for. They are very flexible with scheduling and life balance.
good,The best part about working there was getting to know the men that you are taking care of.  They are all very special in their own ways

good,"Hr was horrible nobody followed chain on command, it was unorganized.."
good,"had a changing working schedule.co-workers very helpful, was"
good,I mixed paint for Customers. I love the customer interaction. Had wonderful co-workers. Great teamwork. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers choose their paint color. Hardest part of my job was to see an unsatisfied customer.
good,Customer service and being able to help others with their outside projects is always satisfying.
good,"Lowe's is your typical retail job.  I worked on the weekend team so I got to work in most areas of the store.  When I came into work I would look at the schedule and it would have listed which weekend team people were to go to which departments.  If that department became less busy the management would put me into another department that needed my help so I could work up to 3-4 different departments a day but usually it was just 1 or 2.  The training is bad as all Lowe's cared about was making sure their employees learned all of the store's policies.  I got zero training of any of the departments before I started out on the floor.  The management pretty much left us to learn on our own with the occasional help from a regular department employee.  "
good,The manager;s were nice and helpful. They did good at training me and the Employees were great.
good,Good place to work if your are looking to start a career in a related field or in the retail lumber business.
good,A chance for upward mobility.  Good part-time pay.  Good co-workers.  A healthy company that gives plenty of hours for those looking for it.
good,I learned a lot about customer service in my 7 years with Lowe's. I started off as part time and with hard work and a great work ethic I was able to work my way up to Assistant Store Manager in a short period of time. I enjoy working with my employees and customers. I enjoy watching my employees grow and develop in their roles. I enjoy helping customers find what they need for their projects.
good,"On a typical day, I'd mix paint, cut blinds and go with the flow of the work day."
good,loved working and learning here. Just wish they would have offered a full time position
good,Lowes is a busy and fast paced work environment that changes every day. I've learned exceptional customer service skills that I use every day while using time management to get stocking and cleaning done. Working in paint is the best part of my day at Lowes and being able to help customers achieve their desired look.
good,"*A typical Day would be me checking my emails reveiwing how we did in sales in the past days and see what we can do better. Then head out to the Sales floor Take care of every customer that pass me by with anything they need help with. Walk them to the item they are looking for offer them any offers or promotions we have, and make the customer feel like they are more then welcome to come back and knowing we are here to help. "
good,Currently I work as a CDL Driver. I load trucks for delivery and then deliver product to the customer's homes.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job at Lowes were the customers. I truly enjoyed helping them plan their gardens, ponds, fire pits and walkways. I loved sharing my ideas with people and in turn having them tell me how great their projects turned out. It was a pleasure to have people come back and thank me for the advice and assistance I gave them and tell me how nice it was to have professional help from Lowes."
good,"Best job ive ever had job salary was amazing not including the bonus each month, benefits great"
good,"I really loved working for this company!!  I would assist the Department Manager in making sure that both, the electrical and plumming, departments were running smooth.  My day would consist of, depending on a the shift I was working, putting up frieght or unload the frieght truck, doing my paper work (Cycle Counts, P & L report, and Negitives on Hand), Stocking shelves, Covering other departments for breaks, and giving the BEST customer service that I could to each customer all the time!"
good,Retail job that lets you learn a lot about home improvement.
good,I enjoyed working there. I worked with a lot of nice people. The hardest part of the job is you never sit down all day.
good,"The job was pretty easy. I ran the register, interacted with customers, and did our best to prevent theft. I worked in all of the register areas at least once including customer service; however, my main area was outdoors. It was really hot when the temperatures were warm, and cold when the days cooled off. That was the worst part of my job. Co-workers were quick to help you out and make you better at your job because they wanted you to be able to help in any and all aspects of the job when needed. Management was a little out for themselves and was not too concerned with the little people. That presented challenges sometimes, but for the most part the other little people helped you out. Overall, not a bad job to have."
good,"Plant and landscape a job site"
good,"working at lowes is nice while waiting for something better to come along. the customers are nice and the store is constantly busy to make time go by fast. management is helpful and do their job very well.  Because im a all around lovable and open person to new people i enjoy my co workers getting to know them and . the most enjoyable part of my job is the customers, althouth some are not as nice as others, the smiling customers and nice people make my day"
good,"I would arrive in early morning hours to have team meeting with work crew to plan our day for what needed accomplished.  I learned how to trust others judgment, work as a team, and communicate effectively with others.  I enjoyed working closely with my manager and coworkers, we were like a family.  The hardest part was the amount of constant physical work accompanied by the long distance traveling.  I enjoyed working with my team the absolute most."
good,"Just like any other department or big box store, this is retail."
good,Great time having fun selling hardware and great customers
good,"On  a daily basis I deal with a variety of people with multiple reasons to shop our stores.  I answer all questions whether in person or over the phone to the best of my ability.  And if I am unsure I direct them to someone that can answer it for them.  I really enjoy dealing with people as well as learning more about our store, it's products and the services we offer."
good,Lowe's is an enjoyable place to work. Each day is a new challenge as I attempt to provide superior customer service to new as well as repeat customers. My management team is knowledgeable and encourages me to pursue advancement and to continue learning new things. I attempt to expand my knowledge of the products and services that we offer daily. I also enjoy answering my co-workers questions when I am able.
good,Good company to work for.  Friendly atmosphere.  Genuine care for customers.
good,"there is always something to do at lowes distribution center. when you are done with your area, you can always go to another part of the dc to help out. the schedule was nice and there was always something to be done. the co-workers varied from young to old to all areas of expertise. there was never a dull moment."

good,"Learned excellent customer service techniques"
good,"assist customer and learn new tasks ,the co worker are overall nice and fun, the management is very laid back which is good but can be bad in certain ways. The environment is easy going relaxed."
good,I liked the job and schedule. management was ok people were cool and I liked working alone in my trailer
good,"fast paced, great managers and coworkers. you will learn something new everyday from each other and the customers. the biggest satisfaction on the job is when you help someone solve their problems and they don't have to return and they can stay at home with their families instead of doing a project and being separated from their families."
good,"I have been working for Lowe's since July 2011 at Lowe's in Howell, NJ. I started as a Customer Service Associate and had great training for the job. The training they provided prepared me well in a short amount of time but only if you are willing to put in the effort to prepare yourself. They were very flexible with my schedule. I was promoted in March 2012 to Head Cashier and gave me a lot more managerial training and experience and my hiring manager really worked with me to help me understand how a store is run. I learned the ins-and-outs of the front end and really enjoyed it. Lowe's has always worked with my schedule and helped ME but when it comes to functioning as a store on an operational level, Lowe's and its' store managers and assistant store managers they really need to learn not only how to communicate and get on the same page with each other but also communicate that with their employees. That really is my only complaint."
good,I learn how to handle cash in a fast past & got to meet new people daily
good,they are a good company a hard working environment and great managers
good,I spend my day processing returns taking payments faxing papers anwering multiple phone calls and most of all helping customers

good,great work environment  and team. Always a good day with great management. Never backed down from a challenge.
good,"Fast pace environment that is high volume, excellent teamwork and rewarding."
good,"A typical night at Lowe's includes helping customers and scanning customers items. If you work in the evening, it can be busy at times. When there is any downtime the managers make sure the employees clean and get everything straightened up.By the time the store is closed there are usually very little things to get done before going home for the night."
good,"I work on weekends only. I help customers wall-to-wall from Lumber/building materials to Outside lawn & garden. I am certified in every dept. Always continuing my education. Managers are always very helpful when I need it. My co-workers on my team are great to work with. I enjoy working with people so this job has been very rewarding for me."

good,Interact with customers. Assisted with purchases. Handled financial transactions; Stocked.
good,Lowes Home Improvement is a good place to work with friendly caring people. I learned a lot while working there and not just home improvement things. Corporate structure and how things work on the inside of retail. A downside that I had with the company was the turnover rate of general managers. Once you got close to one of them it seemed like they just went away. So it was hard to be recognized by a manager to possibly move up in position sense.
good,Lowes was a great company they were strict but had the best coworkers. Just no longer happy with the job
good,"Pull orders the that day, working  here you must always focus on safety. There a lot of team work, make this job more enjoyable. The only thing  hard about this job, isjust not enough money. Great shift to work!"
good,it was only seasonal but i was outside everyday and loved it great group of people i worked with!
good,"Great welcoming atmosphere, where all employees are friendly and helpful."
good,Lowes is a fast paced call center and the supervisors tend to neglect their employees needs.
good,"A normal day for me involves checking out customers who have chosen products for purchase.  The work environment and my coworkers are great.  The management could use a little adjusting, but overall are acceptable.  The hardest part of the job is getting used to standing on concrete for an entire shift."
good,"A typical work day included operating the cash register, customer sercivice. Cash handling and mulitasking,"
good,This was a position I enjoyed because I had the chance to work with the public and advise many people with questions about their home improvement. My co-workers were good and I had a good relationship with everyone I worked with.
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for.  Provides good pay and benefits along with a fun work environment.  Pushes you to meet highest expectations but, in a fun motivating way.  Through out my time working at Lowe's I have learned how to manage more than 100 employees at any given time, how to maintain and surpass sales forecasts, merchandising to meet customers needs and focus a team on exceptional customer service.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, the relationships with the customers and employees I will never forget."

good,"The job was physical but it was rewarding with good pay,  managmant and benefits."
good,I love greeting and helping customers and if you do to this is a good place to work. The only thing i didn't like is that it was bad management
good,Overnight job work is based on after hours of business lots of physical work and lots of heavy lifting great co-workers.
good,"It is a great store to work at, especially if you know anything to do with Lowes merchandise"
good,In working with this company I learned the value of team work.  Together with another employee we would do team deliveries to customer residents.  Understanding each others strength and weaknesses was very important.
good,"The hardest part of the job is the enormity of the workload, assisting in the management of expenses for 189 stores. Management is good to work with, very open to feedback and suggestions. I enjoy the job, its nice to see success right in front of me based on how much money I can bring back to the company."
good,"*Working with productive staff"
good,Everybody got along great.  All worked towards the same goal.
good,"Facing the store shelves and aisles and assisting customers in all store areas. learned the basics of working in a retail environment. management was informative and helpful. co-workers were nice, but had a tendency to shun newer employees. job wasn't difficult. thoroughly enjoyed meeting new people (customers)"
good,"A typical day would consist of stocking shelves, helping customers and cleaning.  I learned how to maintain count of every piece of inventory in the electrical department.  Management changed three times in the period i worked there.  Coworkers were nice and stuck to their departments.  Hardest part of the job was moving stock with customers being closed off to a part of the department."
good,"Working at Lowes I dealt with many different customers. I helped alot of people out on a daily basis, and gave alot of information about our products. I loved all my coworkers and I had great managers.  It was a fairly easy job and I enjoyed getting to help different people everyday."
good,I go to work smiling ready to ring out a customer at any moment and try to always hit my goal for the day.
good,Worked with customers on what home decors will work best for them and their needs. Lowes is a customer focused company and I enjoyed that!
good,"Way to much drama, but besides that it is a good place to work. There is room for advancement and most of the people there are good. Management is awful though, they don't care at all and expect much more to get done on the floor then whats possible with the constant interruption from customers."
good,"Lowe's is a good company to work for. They have good health beneifits as well as paid vacation. I like that fact that I can learn something new every day. One negative thing would be being short staffed at times which can be stressfull and aggrivating. "
good,"I enjoy working at Lowes.  The people are nice, the company is growing, however it is still small and can feel that way sometimes.  I would recommend Lowes to a friend"
good,"Learned their cash register system, management was OK, co-workers were fun to work with. the hardest part was when it was slow, & the most enjoyable part was working in the garden center when it was busy"
good,"my days where the same, I liked the job that I had (assembling). I worked there for 3 months and the Management was ok and my co-workers where nice to work with, we got along. the reason I like this job is because I worked on thing that I can put together."
good,"I go to work having to put away loads of boxes worth of tools and hardware that has been left there.  I have become more of a people person then I was before.  The management is good they are understanding and easy to get along with.  My co-workers are funny for the most part and reasonable.  The hardest part of my job is finding more to do once I have done pretty much all I can. And, the most enjoyable part of my job is when there is a nice amount of work for me to do so once I get done time has flown by."
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful while on the ""floor"". There is so much going on at once that tempers DO flare; however, are calmed in the break room by fellow workers. The importance of multi-tasking and fast-paced working abilities have definitely been recognized at this place of employment. Communication has also been extremely important; although, it could definitely use some improvement. Management aids workers in any way possible, and co-workers are always there as stress-relief and assisting bodies. The hardest part of my job is trying to satisfy every customer and their specific needs. Although, it can be done, it may require more time being spent with one than another. The people I work with is absolutely the most enjoyable part of my job! We are truly comparable to a large family!"
good,Being a truck unloader has been an overall a good job. I have learned how to stay motivated at all times and how to get a job done in a timely manner. I have learned management roles being in charge of instructing new employees on how to complete the job. The hardest part of the job was not having enough help to get the job done. I most enjoy working with a good team and driving the power equipment.
good,"•	Financially responsible for the store in all aspects. Reviewed all financials monthly and cut or approved spending daily."
good,Solid job for someone looking to be paid well in the retail field or start a life long career
good,"Decent company and good benefits, just not fittig for family life. Management does not like to work hand in hand and communication is lacking."
good,- small agency where you can contribute to real growth (even being an intern)
good,"a typical day at work is giving overrides for discounts across the store from lumber to garden center and the front end, customer service and return desk.  some days its a lot of running.  I put the money out for all registers if opening and put it away if closing.  I ring up customers, process refunds and take care of customer complaints."
good,This is a fast paced environment that is very hands on experience. The work here challenges you physically and makes you work quick on your feet to resolving issues and multi-task.
good,"Working here I saw two store managers and saw how differently you get treated depending on who you get along with. So it can be enjoyable if you get to know the right people, if you don't you may not last very long."

good,"Lowe's provided an intense work experience.  I started as a part time cashier, but on my 4th day I was asked to work in the cash office because of my good job performance.  I immediately received a raise in pay.  Eventually, I was promoted to administrative department manager and was put in charge of the front end of the store.  This included payroll and scheduling for 150 employees, and overseeing all cashiers and customer service employees.  I also settled the financial reports and daily summary.  My favorite part of the job was my relationship with my employees.  I still love to return to Lowe's and usually get a lot of hugs from these friends."

good,"My job was very demanding, but it was well worth it. I enjoyed meeting customers and assisting them in every way possible."
good,"Working on the stock crew was hard work but everyone helped each other. If someone had alot of merchandise to stock, we all helped when we finished ours. Our manager at night was clear on what needed to be accomplished and complimented a job well done."
good,great place to work with fare wages. deliever good to customers homes.drive threwout the state of wisconsin delievering and installing appliances

good,"Higher pay than most retailers."
good,"A typical day at work are customers who need help with specific projects and I guide them through. On occasion other co-workers will be more qualified to assist with certain projects, and we work together as a team to provide the best customer service possible. Our management team is very well trained in most every department, and often they are very helpful in providing the best customer care possible. There are many times that assembly is behind on building merchandise, and I am asked to go assemble. This job involves so much that I could go on and on. The hardest part of the job is the really slow times. I would much rather be interacting with customers than finding ways to keep myself busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sincere thank you from customers."
good,"Sometimes busy "
good,Working in Retail to help customer find there needs. I enjoy working with people because not only do I help the customer but I learn a lot with communicating to make sure there needs are met. The team I work with we have a great working relationship and the hardest part of the job is making sure all the customers are leaving satisfied. Not that we don't satisfy our customer but just making sure they leave with everything and has a happy shopping experience. Customer Service is what I love the most about my job. I enjoy helping others that's in need of help.
good,"I loved working as a cashier, meeting new people & having some short & some long conversations with customers. I had my bad days & my good days but more good ones than bad. I loved going in to work, all my coworkers where amazing to work with. I learned a lot from the company & if they offered me a job again at Lowe's I would take it in a heartbeat."
good,"Great company, didn't want operations people/store personnel to move to HQ, many management changes"

good,"Enjoyed helping people finding the things they needed."
good,"Management as well as my co-workers were phenomenal"
good,"A typical day at Lowe's would consist on getting your daily tasks done at a certain time.  Checking your sales, margins, and work that also needs to be done.  Upon that there are weekly tasks that have to be done in a timely manner as well as servicing other customers throughout the day.  Many of the associates are very hard workers and there has be time for teamwork and dedication to see a company go from good to great."
good,"Long hours for managers"
good,Typical day consisted of taking care of customers while making sure the department stayed in optimum shopping condition. I built my management skills while learning the customer service business. I enjoyed my co-workers very much and leaving them was the hardest part of my resignation. I loved working with people on their projects but the hardest part was keeping the department in order which takes me away from the customers at times.
good,Lowe's has been a great place to work. Not only do I enjoy what I do but I love the variety of customers and clients that come in to the store!

good,I learned to work with customers and enjoyed helping people and making them leave the store a happy customer.
good,learning new things everyday training keeps busy and easy to maintain clean and safe environment for customers.
good,"I enjoyed the interacting with the employees and customers."
good,I work nights as a stocker which is very demanding physically because not only do i have to stock merchandise more often then not i have to unload the merchandise before its stocked.  Our over night team works hard and gets along very well together which makes our nights go by rather smoothly.
good,"Everyday day we start with a morning meeting where we talked about the stores stats and how we can always improve, you know Lowe's ""NEVER STOP IMPROVING"". In that same meeting we acknowledge the employee that gave excellent customer service to a satisfied customer then end it off with a LOWES cheer. After that everyone receives the task for the day and began work while helping customers at the same time .While completing task we learn how to use power equipment,power tool,fork lifts. Overall the management team is pretty strict and checks up on you to make sure work is getting done very often, everybody meaning co-workers work together like a family feel environment .The hardest part of the job is working alone lifting heavy, other then that its good"
good,"Though new to Lowe's I have been welcomed, and encouraged to strive. The Lowe's team has been nothing short of helpful at every instance when I have been in need. A full positive experience."
good,"I worked at Lowe's for 4 years and may go back if I can't find something else as good.   I worked in several different departments and was surrounded by management and fellow employees that were capable and wanted to give great customer service.  "

good,"Currently working in management in a position representing almost five million dollars in sales annually. Train, staff, and encourage staff to meet and surpass company expectations in presentation, organizational efficiency and sales volume. Working in line with other managers in the company provides the opportunity to gain skills through others however does not promote upward movement in the company. Hardest part of the job would have to be the inability to ensure upward growth while currently one of the ""underemployed' in this economy. Most rewarding part of the job would have to be providing the customer with solutions to their product. "
good,"Good work environment, but no real notice on when seasonal employment was done.  I learned a lot about customer service and outdoor power equipment."
good,Lowe's is a progressive company that is changing to meet the needs for customers in the 21 century. It is an exciting time to work with the company as a Change Agent. I am part of a great team and helping associates develop and grow within the company is fun and rewarding. Lowe's is now a Government Contracted company so it is important to know and work within the set guidelines.
good,Enjoyable place to work. Friendly co workers and management. Low pressure with emphasis on customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is solving customer problems and helping them find the materials they need for their project.
good,"Work day was fast paced and educational"
good,Great place to work if you love to move around all day. Rotating schedule makes it hard to plan family life. Meet a great amount of different kinds of people.
good,"Retail isn't everyone's cup of tea. If you like it, Lowe's is a better to place to work with better benefits and pay compared to others. The store I worked at had a very strong management team but often overlooked taboos such as frequent call-ins by college students on weekends. "
good,I have enjoyed working at Lowe's for almost eight years.  I enjoy working with the public and people from different backgrounds and cultures.  The hardest part of my job is working a schedule that isnot consistent.
good,"Everyone here always helped each other when needed. Store was short staffed alot, but again, we all helped each other."
good,Great people and friendly. Customers that came in to look and build things was friendly. 
good,"My typical day at work includes 1st and foremost our customer needs comes 1st ... overseeing and manage inventory in my dept ,as well as helping customers with projects at home providing estimates for jobs installed by lowes or do it yourselfers manage my sales "
good,"Helping people with their needs feels very rewarding. If I don't know the answer all I have to do is ask and someone will know the answer and help me. Everyone is very friendly ,too. Learning where everything is is tough but it seems I'm always learning."
good,I am a greeter and help people find things they are looking for. I am in charge of a training tool called Race for the Cup. I have to make sure co workers go in each day and take the 5 daily quizzes. It is a training device but also a competition between stores. The hardest part of my job is standing on the concrete floor for 8 hours a day. I also get very bored. I enjoy helping customers find items they need and especially enjoy helping them pick out paint colors.
good,"While at lowes I worked often in the lumber part of the store, helping customers pick the type of wood that would work best for each customers individual project. The managers as well as my coworkers were great. The hardest part of this job is that I was only a temporary hire. The best part was that the morale of the company as a whole was great."
good,"the co-workers and customers always make your day, they are what keep you coming back"
good,Lowes is a good company to work for and I work in the receiving area and its easy at times but can get pretty hectic. overall easy job
good,"Co-workers are quick to help a new employee if needed, the work environment is busy with multiple interactions with customers. "
good,Fun co-workers with good chemistry. Problems with unflexible hours.

good,"I run a register all day and deal with customers and their complaints, I answer phone calls and money. I get along with all of my co-workers and I always have a good attitude."
good,Fun and productive environment.  Good group of coworkers. Can be hectic at times. 
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for if the management is good. I've learned a lot from working here and still do to this day. Employees there are a tight nit group who help each other with the occasional employee who is not a team player. Management can be great at times but tend not to do their job. The hardest part of the job is trying to help customers not only in your department but in other departments where no one is scheduled. The most enjoyable is hanging out with employee that in turn you become friends with.  
good,"A  typical day was unloading merchandise and putting it on the shelves. I learned how to interact with the customers. The hardest part of the job is when we unloaded trucks, the most enjoyable was the smiles when the job was done."

good,I used to earn a really good salary at Lowes untill they stopped the commission program.
good,A good place to work with acceptable benefits. Hours are not consistent. Full time is on a 4 week rotation.  Days off are always after closing and followed by opening. 
good,This was my very first and so far only job and working for Lowe's taught me how to provide excellent customer service and learned how to work for others.  Also taught me that a business runs best off of team work.
good,Lowe's pays well for the retail industry.  The company has high turnover; this is due to firing employees over the smallest things.  Management at times can be a big joke and usually the hard working managers are passed around or leave.  The company does not have a union and this makes it easier for stores to make their own rules even though they claim to be fair and have an Open Door policy.
good,Worked here for 3 years. It was fun for the most part. It's a great job for people who like getting to know about home improvement stuff. I loved it here. Their benefits are also pretty great. 
good,"Hard work, the management tends to make things harder than they should be. Focusing too much on the bottom line and forgetting about the customer."
good,"A typical day involved taking credit card payments, processing sales and returns, and generally dealing with most grievances after the go ahead from management.  The coworkers were pretty great, never had any kind of problem with anybody.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the very upset customers who could generally not be placated no matter what was done for them.  Most enjoyable part was the customer who showed appreciation for what we were able to do for them  "
good,Dealing with the general public is my most enjoyable part of the job and there's nothing hard about the job. Management has taught me to stay productive. My only dislike about the company is providing workers with less hours
good,I enjoyed getting to know the different personalities.  Lowe's was definitely one of my favorite places to work!
good,"Working at Lowe's I discovered three different types of customers. Those who know what they want, those who are looking for inspiration, and those who are looking to begin a new project in need of materials. Knowing these details and the right questions to ask makes it that much easier to assist customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is discovering all the different types of projects people are working on! From daily maintenance to remodeling back yards. "
good,lowe's is a great place. has its day but the environment is wonderful.
good,"Very fast paced!  This job requires you to be a multitasked as well as detailed oriented.  Given that you interact with customers, your attitude has to be 100% at all times!  The job can be somewhat stressful as you get extremely busy at times but the benefit of helping customers out weighs it all in the end.  "
good,"Go to work at 4 am, unload the truck and start processing my departments merchandise, interact with customers, managers, coworkers. I leaned a lot about home improvement, how to drive forklifts, cut: tile, glass, carpet, keys lumber, drywall. The hardest part of the job was the early mornings. Most enjoyable was the cutting and driving forklifts"
good,"Employees are happy so work was always more enjoyable. However, the job was only part time."
good,A typical day at work consisted of sitting not doing a lot. Until i had a customer always kept my area clean and tidy.
good,I helped people design their landscaping and sold them the correct products to get the job done.
good,"A typical day at work was extremely busy for me. I had to interview, hire, instruct new hire orientation, make sure that every new hire completed their training. Once their training was complete, partner them with a mentor within their new department so that what they learned through training they would now get on the job training. I also had to make sure that the existing employees were staying up to date on their ongoing training. I resolved any employee relation issues, I reported all worker's compensation injuries & worked closely with the adjusters until the claims were closed. I managed all unemployment claims, updated reports, and twice a month I would go into the community to build relationships with colleges, churches, veterans, etc. to make them aware of our company vacancies. I would also attend career fairs and attend meetings at the Chamber of Commerce and other organizations to keep Lowe's name on the minds of these organizations to remind them of the products that we sell as well as the vacancies that we have."
good,A typical day at work it for the most part very pleasant and well organized with job duties. I have learned that customers are the most important part of my job. The management that I have the privilege to work with are well structured and very easy to work with. I enjoy working with everyone of our employees. We consider ourselves and one big team. The hardest part of the job is you are always standing for very long periods of time. You are not ever allowed to sit and a lot of days we are so busy we do not get a break.
good,"Working for Lowes helped me in my everyday organizational skills, plus the company placed me in a position to succeed through out the company. I learned the importance of customer and client relation, how to run a multi-million dollar business and gave me the ability to and knowledge of a manager and more important a leader. Dealing with people can be difficult, but the training I received helped me daily. Working along side of the my fellow employees made the difficult times seem less stressful,simply because we understood what the other was dealing with and gave each other the proper motivation to continue through our day."
good,"Lowe's is a pretty fast paced environment, it's staff is friendly and helpful but at times the company can be quite demanding. It can be repetative at time but no more than any other job. If you have an outgoing personality and love meeting new people if may just be the job for you."

good,This was my first job and I don't think it could have been a better experience for my.
good,load and unload product for customers
good,it was a good job with a few perks. But nothing spectacular just an average job.
good,"With a big corporation company, it is easy to get lost in the shuffle. But with Lowe's, everyone was on the same team and there were people everywhere willing to lend a hand."
good,Learned how to manage employees in multiple departments. Being able to know and see what was happening in each department was a large learning curve at a young age. Hardest part was not truly having a passion for what we sold.
good,this is a ok place to work it just retail either like it or you dont
good,* Fun and enjoyable co-workers
good,great 401k and stock plan.
good,As a customer service rep at Lowe's I enjoyed helping patrons with simple to complicated questions regarding their home projects. I didn't really learn much except for the locations and functionality of some of the items in the store. The management was very fair and very appreciative of your work and dedication when they noticed and I can't think of a hard part but if i had to say one it would be the unpredictable schedule changes but what I enjoyed most was the location the that particular Lowe's.
good,A typical day at work consists of answering a multi-line telephone answering customer questions or transfering to specific department. I have learned how to run most systems involved in the front end. Management stays true to the open door policy.
good,an establishment that takes the needs of employees seriously
good,"A typical day consists of developing, planning and executing projects while working as a team. As well as manage inventory and creatively stock and organize merchandise. I learned some tool skills as well as an abundance of information about the products we sell. Managers are organized, helpful, and easy to talk to. Co-workers are helpful, friendly, and have good work ethic. The hardest part of the job is satisfying every customer who walks through the door. The most enjoyable part of working at Lowes is the friendly atmosphere combined with a learning experience."
good,I used to have lot of fun while working. We used to enjoy the work while meeting the project dead lines. The management and my Co-workers are very friendly and helpful. I have learned a lot in this project and continue learning.
good,"I work with a lot of very interesting and enjoyable people. A typical day at work is very fast paced. You need to be a multitasker in order to get things done, but the days seem short in comparison."
good,I was a cashier that learned diffferent hardware tools and also learned the values of doing handy work yourself.
good,"At work I usually help out customers. I bounce around to different departments. I learn good customer service from my co-workers and co-operating with different type of customers. My co-workers are amazing , they helped me out through difficult situations. I really never had a hard part in my job. The most employable part of my job is co-operating with all my co-workers. Which is very awesome."
good,I loved working at Lowes Distribution. Every day was different and I was able to work with everyone. I liked that i was able to fill other departments when help was needed. They allowed me to expand my skills and work experience.

good,I have worked for Lowe's for almost nine years in which I have learned many essential operations.
good,retail monster; retail mentality; do more with less; pay too little; they did have good growth potential if you could stomach the retail merchandising world
good,Those who work hard and are open to feedback have the ability to advance within the company. You need to be versatile in a fast paced retail environment. Management is professional compared to other retailers.
good,working at this place is fun meeting different customers and help the with products search.
good,"very busy, lots of customer interfacing. I've learned how to listen very well and respond appropriately to both customer and employees needs. I've gained experience throughout the store managing different depts.

good,"Assisted customers in flooring selections to meet their needs, Maintained a well coordinated floor plan making sure merchandise was always available to the consumer. Adviced customers on which products would best to meet their expectations and relayed necessary information about our product so that satisfaction of the customer was always met."
good,Work is different daily you never know what you are going to incounter. Sometimes it will be the easiest and somedays the issues are so mind bending that you feel like you didn't accomplish anything. I have to roll with what goes on and be willing to face each issue equally.
good,management has changed hands and is in my opinion not as well versed
good,"I was a multitasker and was trained to do more other than just a cashier. I worked a lot at the Service Desk answering phones and processing returns along with internet orders and just helping customers. I was then trained in the Cash Office where I would balance the registers and keep the safe even. I would also get the deposit ready for the bank and put together a folder for the dailey summary of the store. The managers were great. They made it easy to tallk to if we felt we had a problem or just anything in general. I also liked all my co-workers. I never had a problem with anyone and they were great to work with. The hardest part was probably being at the service desk when I was the only one there when things got crazy but other than that, it was easy. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and being able to make customers happy."
good,Its a good place to work but need better management. The co workers are fun to be around.
good,Work hard and get the job done.
good,each day I was responsible for the cleaning and maintence of the facility.
good,Very relaxed environment. There was favoritism in the store which was frustrating at times.
good,"I was team leader/manager of the outside lawn and garden department while away for school. It was a physically and mentally draining job, still it was satisfying. Worked afternoon and night hours due to full time school schedule. Job consisted of directing other department laborers, loading items and helping customers, etc. Lowes is a large corp so the work environment was well established and maintained. Workers were content and the job was somewhat enjoyable. I loved working outside, and if it werent for the low pay, i would consider going back. I love working outside and i love physical work, though realistically it usually cant pay the bills. I enjoyed helping customers whether they appreciated it or not, and i enjoyed leading a small team of coworkers."
good,"My job at Lowe's isn't that bad actually, the managers just make it really awful to work there."
good,Policies seem to revolve around what is needed at seasonal changes.

good,"Sales floor associate, responsible for Paint Department and Windows and Floors Departments."
good,"Start with making sure product was on tables. I relearned a lot about the product. The management treat me with much respect, and still does. The co-workers were just fantastic to work with.

good,Co-workers are good and mangers care about you. Employees need to be held accountable more.
good,deal with customers
good,"A typical day at Lowes would be clocking in and speaking to every customer who crosses your path or line of vision. Also walking thru the department to straighten up shelves, mix paint and assist customers anywhere in the store. The associates are very friendly, and tend to welcome newcomers openly. The hardest part of the job is the impact hours. This is a time frame set thru out the day where associates cannot do any tasks (down stock merchandise, etc). The focus is on the customers. This is an awesome thing except as an associate you tend to find yourself bored and wishing one could work, if anything but to get ahead or past time. I enjoy the customer interaction and satisfaction, just to help someone make a better home for themselves or others is very rewarding."
good,I like waiting on customers and giving them advice on the products
good,"My day is spent conducting a daily safety review of the store, then daily weekly and monthly operational tasks. Training managers and associates on all aspects of retail operations along with being the stores link to Market and regional managers.

Usualy Stars with Flabed Delivery wicth are loaded on the oppsite end of the building from me. My manager Lets me out the back. I go out begin my dot inspection start the semi afterwarming up drive over to comercial end and begin loading my truck. After loading my truck a manager comes out and checks off the load. Then I secure the load set up my gps and call the customer and let them know how long I will be. Usually one or two flatbeds then I move on to do 24'box truck deliverys. Backing the truck up to the dock loading the truck and getting checked off by a manager. These deliveries can be very difficult e.g. frigdes we caring them in with staps up and down stairs around diffcult corners. Some times having to tear down it to just get it in the house. After doing 6-8 deliveries we head back to the store empty out the truck and park and go home. Usually a 10-12hr day.
good,"If you are used to working in corporate retail it is all pretty much the same. they pay well when compared to other businesses in the same field, but they do not value their employees. Everyone is replaceable and is treated as such. Management can be difficult to deal with because they are more focused on sales numbers then the happiness of their employees."
good,. Funny and upbeat but getting the job done too.
good,It was so long ago I do not remember working here. I do remember that they paid better than the other jobs I had applied to.

good,Lowes as a whole was pretty good but management was poor and side taking...kinda a good ol'boys club if you know what I mean?

good,Work with commercial customers to generate sales. Work to generate new commercial accounts.

As a head cashier I am there to help cashiers with transactions, answer phone calls and customer questions and run credit applications. I am also acting as a manager so I help with customer complaints. It gets difficult when cashiers call out because when I am now its a slower location with little coverage so I have to prepair for call outs so cashiers can still go to lunch on time. In order to manage the front end I have to be very organized. When I am in the cash office I put out the moring tills and build the tills for the next day. I have to make sure the safe is balanced and order money when needed."
good,"Lowes is a good place to work, frindly enviroment. Co-workers are helpful."
good,"I have worked there for over four years and have had good times and well not so good times. That goes for any job. This job is tough only because of people, that is the only stressful part. Working with the public can be frustrating at times, if not down right madening. On the up side I like and am friends with a lot of the people that I work with. The benefits and pay are good for a retail store even if you are part time. Over all you could do a lot worse. Like most jobs what makes it better or worse is the people that you work with."
good,Seriously a great place to work. My co-workers help out a lot.

good,"Working at Lowes' has been a great experience. Everyday, management interacts with co-workers throughout the store. The strong focus on the ""Open Door Policy"" provides co-workers with a platform to address their needs. Everyday, customer service remains the highest priority."
good,Great managment as well as co-workers
good,Lowes is a professional workplace that is very flexible and kind to their emloyees
good,I was a seasonal worker. I worked there for 5 months season ended
good,"Basically I work on the cash register, at the customer service desk, and also I work at the returns desk. This job has helped me to improve my customer service skills. My co workers were a mixed bag but overall we all worked together really well. The hardest part of the job was the unpredictability of the day to day work. The enjoyment of being able to service the customer."
good,"Check the areas I was in charge of made sure everything was stocked properly, new freight was out on shelves, areas were clean and properly priced, consisting customers. Learned about products in different areas in the store. Management was good as well as the co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with other employees"
good,Lowe's was a great place to work because I enjoy dealing with the public where I can show people skills. It gave me the opportunity for further advancement in management. I had some medical problems while I was there and was no longer able to do the job expected of me.
good,I would love a career where I have a future and a little more security. I work nights and weekends so it would be nice to have some better hours but I realize that's not always going to be an option. I work hard at my company but I know I could be replaced if they wanted to get someone in there for less money. I've been told from high up management that we are all completely replaceable. I was pretty ticked off that he said that but maybe I shouldn't expect much more from a big box retailer. I like working with customer and through the 4 stores I have helped set up there have been tons of great and unforgettable people that I've worked with. The hardest part would have to be the hours that change every week. It's hard to have a life when you never know what time you're working from week to week.
good,Very enjoyable working environment and friendly.
good,Worked well with my family and medical issues sustained while working there. Eager to move forward. Wants to see you further your career. Excellent training and efficiency in business matters.

good,"Small town, no advancement."

good,"my day at lowes consit of stocking displays,keeping work area clean at all times,helping contractors, electricians and general public with applications. by being a electrical specialist and having sales of ten thousand dollars weekly, management kept me in fashion electric. plus having over twenty four year of experience in electric whole distribution i fit well in that position. the hard part of that job was climbing 10 and 12 feet ladders to pull orders. by being a people person i really enjoyed helping customers"

good,I took care of the shipping and receiving in the garden center. also helped customers find what they were looking for.
good,"A typical day could be interesting and fun. I learned how to listen to the customer's needs and how to exceed their expectations. My supervisors weren't afraid to lend a hand and give me new opportunities. My co-workers were willing to pitch in to help meet deadlines. The hardest part of the position was stocking merchandise while it was slow, and there was little interaction with others. The most enjoyable part of this position was meeting so many different people."
good,work as associate in paint. learned all aspects of retail. enjoyed the people and customers i worked with
good,Good company to work for that has taught many skills involving home improvement.
good,"great place, good people, and just a seasonal job. Managers are really nice and Head cashiers are nice also."
good,"When i came into work I made sure my assoc. had done what they were told,then i helped customers,put stock away,built endcaps,helped out other assoc.This was my favorite place to work until Omar Khan came as a hr manager,he seen fit to make sure i did not keep my job,by listening to hear say from other employees without even asking me.So I just want to say I put my blood into this career and he stripped it away from me without a warning and that is not fair."
good,"great place to start career, good stepping stone to bigger things. Just don't work past your 8hrs. class A."
good,"Greeting the customers, how to take an order on the cash register. A typical is coming into the workplace a positive attitude, co-workers was friendly and gotten along with well, putting into a department that you not familiar with such as the garden department when no one taught me whatto do just getting on the register. I love my job and go out my way by staying overtime"
good,Always something new to do in the company...staying busy and working hard

good,"Your constantly busy, there will always be someone to help, and the cashiers are always looking for guidance."
good,"night shift, unload goods using folklift off trucks, learned to operate folklift and standup electric pallet jack"
good,Lowe's is at a point where they are rapidly changing with the time. From how they deal with customers to how the order items and what they are able to get. Fast past and fun place to work.
good,I learned better people skills. A typical work day consisted of just standing there waiting for customers to come to the register to be rang out. The managers were nice and was always willing to help out with anything that was needed. Working with some of the nice co workers that were there that made me laugh.
good,I would like to see more advancement opportunities for college graduates with Business degrees.
good,Great mix of people to work with from all walks of life. Co-workers seem to get along with one another very well.
good,helping customers from 9-6

good,Lowe's is a great company to work for. Good people and good values.
good,"Very busy store, left to go back to school, don't like retail that much"
good,helped clients with the redisign of their kitchen and baths.
good,In deliveries I generally do not spend much time in the store. I am responsible for loading the truck in the morning and insuring timely deliveries. Management at Lowe's are all supportive and willing to work with the associates to insure a possitive work environment.
good,"great job very good place to wrk, also received tips, nice working environment"
good,"All the coworkers loved to sit around and trash talk other people. The management did not like scheduling you around time that was needed. If you asked off, even 3 months ahead of time, you still had to work those days. Everyone was always complaining about someone there. If you asked to take a break at a certain time, that no one else was breaking, they would tell you no, for no reason. Out of all the coworkers, I only talked to about 5-7 people. Which is sad, because I usually talk to everyone."
good,"A company with lots of opportunity for growth. Good people, and great benefits."
good,Hour are fixable not the same everyday. Some of the customers can make you crazy. The people are amazing.
good,Pretty good place to work. Taught me how to use a order picker and i got my power equiptment license
good,I ran the front end of the store and managed the cashiers and customer service desk. I have learned management roles and handle difficult customers.The hardest part of my job is the schedule I had to work. I would like a set schedule Monday through Friday. I enjoyed the leadership role and tried to make our cashiers the best they could be.
good,While working for Lowe's I learned how to be a successful salesman. I was able to take all of the management skills I obtained through previous employment with other companies and apply it on a larger scale with more responsibility.
good,to have patience and to overkill on kindness.
good,good
good,Good management staff that was willing to help each other with day to day operations.
good,Supervise cashiers by making break and lunch schedules. Advise cashiers on issues they are unaware of. Respond to customer issues and/or complaints.
good,Lowe's of N. Columbus was a very busy store that paid well. You got raises frequently. Management could be better but your co-workers are both good and bad. Only take this job if you're really willing to work.
good,"A typical day is doing time keeping, editing schedules. Creating new hire files. Copying, faxing. Answering phones and inquires. Any and all request that HR manager deeds."
good,"I enjoyed working here, it allowed me to become involved with the public"
good,Lowe's was a good wage for a good days work. The work wasn't hard just frustrating at times. Great customer service was number one priority and I liked that about the company in general.
good,Excellent place to move up the corporate ladder. Great deal of knowledge learned here
good,"Working at Lowe's there are no typical day at work each day is different in many ways; for example, one day I could be just up front, the next in lumber or outside garden. The management is greater then most they do work around my schedule when I need it the most, which I really appreciate! I would say that the most enjoyable part of job is all the people I work with. They all make it fun and enjoyable everyday."
good,"Extremely challenging.. Hardest part of the job is balancing my duties, managing my Associates and waiting on Customers."
good,"Lowe's is a very hands on job that requires employees to have great customer service and be aware of their surroundings. Cleaning is a part of every job for not only my safety but for customers as well. I learned a lot regarding theft prevention, multiple line phones, different computer systems, and how to order store items. The management is very involved with their employees and cared about their safety and that we understood all areas of our jobs. The co-workers were primarily easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the codes but once you do it every day it becomes very easy. I love working with people and especially in a town where the same customers come in a lot and it is great to get to know them better."
good,Lowe's knows how to treat employees and has a very bright future.
good,A typical work day would start at 7 a.m. I learned that this is a seasonal business. Management treated everyone the same. Co-workers were friendly.
good,"ok benefits, great management. good opportunities to move up, plus regular raises. start off low and have to work your way up."
good,Learned Teamwork And Stocking And Mixing Paint Great People To Work With And Learned Job Fast

good,The best paying retail company I ever worked for.. I like the co-workers there.
good,I love working with customers and helping them on a daily basis.
good,Overall Lowe's is a good place to work with great people. It is a good customer service based atmosphere with plenty of room for career advancement.
good,"Fun job, and pay is ok. The Lowe's career is demanding, and dont have time for anything else. I like my job here, but wish it would be a set work week. I work hard at what I do, but sometimes it seem it goes unnoticed."
good,The work environment at lowes is a great experience. The staff is great and always willing to lend a hand in whatever your needs may be.
good,"I love some of the people and the management their but as soon as the backbone got fired, you started to see the true colors. The pay and benefits were good for a part timer but the way you got treated by management was bad."
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for. They will take care of their employee's and offer training in different areas if you want it. As you move up the hours get longer and longer and you lose the work life balance. Decent turn over in mid and upper management as a result.
good,Very good place to work. Most others fun to work with. Hours are sometimes tough. Great benefits!
good,Great place to work. Retail schedule made balancing work and life a challenge. Management and corporate was supportive and encouraging.
good,"Always a team-member, and willing to help others out and go the extra mile."
good,"I have worked for the company for over 2 years now and was satisfied for about the first year and a half. I still love working there but things have changed a lot at my store recently, including management and new corporate policies and procedures, to which some make perfect sense but others just don't seem to the best of the smoothness and daily operations of the store and company."
good,"Lowe’s is a great place to work. There are many ups and downs to working certain jobs, but Lowe’s was an outstanding place to begin my journey. The co-workers are all friendly and always willing to lend a hand."
good,"Es una empresa, increíble, con altos valores y buenos sueldos, pero era difícil el crecimiento y el ambiente laboral era toxico."
good,"Lowe’s is nothing special, I would compare it to pretty much any retail store, the work load is a bit heavy sometimes and other times it’s very light. The managers are okay some are understanding and some"
good,I was trained to work in several areas. Quality Customer service was the main goal. I felt like I did really well but it did not turn into a permanent placement.
good,"This job has been most difficult to say farewell to.  Six years is the longest I've worked for any company, I've had good benefits and overall good coworkers.  However, my requests to be moved to a day shift position have all been ignored, and all applications have been declined and I must get back on days, so it's time to look elsewhere."
good,"A lot of the technology and such is outdated, especially the systems. Management has you say a lot of scripted material, which takes away from the genuineness one can bring to the table. At the Lowes I worked at too, there was a high turnover rate because everyone was leaving."
good,I've worked at Lowes for 5 years now. There's been a lot of change and more changes are coming. Need to be able to adapt well to changes. It's a fast paced environment. Corporate run.
good,"Worked as a Project lead for their remodel program. It was a fun job but the company didn't know what to do with it. They had a Gold mine, but no infrastructure to do anything with it. But it was a good experience to see how a design goes from start to finish"
good,"The company needs to invest in new point of sale software, and take a hard look at their logistics processes."
good,"The employees are really respectful, and considerate of the other people in the store. I had no problems with any employee during my time working here."
good,"Pretty good place to work! Nice people, decent leadership. I really enjoy all the people I work with. The work can be difficult at times, but it is definitely manageable."
good,"My time spent at Lowe's was to earn enough money to pay for daycare expenses and working two full time jobs with a young family at home was a brutal experiance."
good,"I genuinely enjoy working here, but the new scheduling system put-in-place by corporate has everyone in a rut. 8-5's people signed up for years ago, have since been thrown out the window."
good,"I was happy working at lowes but I wanted to look into working outside of retail. The expectations of management were unrealistic, balancing serving the customer and completing projects."
good,Lowes is a good place to work. There are good people who work there and the work is not bad. Pay is decent. Great part time job for extra money. Lowes is okay.
good,"Was there for years. Management kept changing and there was favoritism  in the location.  Job appreciation was few and far between ."
good,"Good team to be a part of, not great pay. Management were okay, big divide between the day staff and the night staff. Not on top of needed training (machines etc.)"
good,"Only down side to working here is the lack of advancement opportunities , I have applied multiple times to advance and still no luck even with owner and management experience."
good,"Its a pretty good place to work. You get great benefits to forgive the pay you get...management has seen ups and downs but mine was pretty decent. They care about your well being first. Busy area, lot of theivery in this store forewarned. Lot of meth heads. Good place overall. I was there for 3 yrs."
good,I have been working for this company going on 12 years now and I have seen a lot of change. This company is very committed to it's core values and retaining talented and tenured employees. A day in the life of Lowe's usually consists of constant ever changing merchandising to meet the needs of the customer and to stand out above the competition. The work place culture is very safety oriented focusing on everyone going home the same way they came to work. The only difficult part of the job that I have found is not having enough people during busy seasons. I can say that the most enjoyable part of the job is building new displays and introducing new products that get our customers really excited.
good,it was a great place to work. I enjoyed going into work everyday. Until one day I was reported by an employee for not finishing a comment I was going to make. He was an African American and thought I was going to say something racist and HR took his side and fired me for it. This was while I was on workers comp. They also fired my fiancée for a stupid reason while he was on workers comp as well.
good,Grate to work with if u have a family very underatanding with situations also if u are sick they will not hold it against you if you don’t have a dr note
good,"I like the job there, for New Port Richey."
good,I now can receiving  product and stack and separete correctly of way efficient and fast and in a new job I can put all this in practice thank you for give me the oportunite
good,a typical day at Lowe's consisted of hard working associates and dedicated professionals. in the same light there were many miscommunications that hindered the associates from fully completing the day to day tasks. we had great people who worked alongside us.
good,Lowes can be a very nice place to work and grow. Make sure items are stocked in your department makes it easy for customers who know what they want. Then give assistance to customers who has a question about products for what ever projects they are working on.
good,"The company take time to look out for its employees, providing training, and encouragement.  Allows their people to grow and rewards them with benefits and responsibility."
good,"I enjoyed the work we did, but at times we could've used more help. The hours were flexible which helped with my social security. One thing that was a problem was our ability to get to the items that we needed to assemble, but we were always able to find help."
good,"I've been with the company for a year and have been able to advance up the ladder to sales specialist. As a starter job, it's a good place to work, especially if schooling is in your future as they offer tuition assistance. On the flip side, be careful of how scheduling works. If you can't find a shift that works for you, the new system is less than desirable, not flexible at all really. You need to have your time in at least 3 months in advance. Management does what they can to work with you and tries their best to make the most of everything."
good,"Lowe' is a good box store over all- The job itself has been a good fit for me however, the higher up and management needs improvement. I have learned a lot about customer service and inventory skills. I am ready for a change."
good,"Exciting to work for, always changing. Job is never guaranteed though because they always get rid of positions or layoff. Would recommend for a starter but not if you looking for long-term because nothing is guaranteed."
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere of my workplace. The environment was fast paced but enjoyable and laid back. If I ever had the opportunity to work at Lowe's again I would.
good,Would have loved to continue with this company but did not have a full time position available. Teamwork was a big focus and the management works with you not just telling you what to do. Was a great place to work.
good,"As a Cashier, I was expected to be very flexible. There were times I had to hop on a register if I was at self-checkout to help out another Team member. It was fun and helpful as far as learning to multitask and working as a team to get the work done."
good,"I enjoy the interaction wit many different customers and employees and being helpful with solving problems."
good,I like working for Lowe’s. I love all my coworkers and everyone seems to get along great. They work with you on making sure you get your schedule matching your needs.
good,"Management was the only thing I didn’t like at Lowe’s. I used to like the company. I loved going to work. But when I had to relocate and transfer to a Lowe’s in Arkansas (2) different locations, it never went through. So if you wanna work for Lowe’s make sure you will never move, because Lowe’s will never allow you."
good,"A typical day starts but printing work-lists. Attending to any Hazmat left from previous day.  Processing RTM, handling OFR and assisting with receiving.  I am contacting vendors through e-mail or phone calls to determine return policy and request RA.  Prep product for return to vendor  or return to DC  for destruction. DA ends with filing paperwork  and  cleaning area.  The people I work with are great. always ready to help."
good,I like working here great people and great hours works with you when needed help to adapt to new schedule and when need to work split shift they help as well
good,Lowe’s was pretty descent to work for until our new CEO was hired and now it feels like we’re turning into Homw Depot.The direction seems to change frequently and doesn’t seem to follow corporate direction due to new CEO and District manager.
good,Too many bosses/managers and they never communicated with each other.  Too much work for the amount of employees on the floor and others not doing their job
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work, the only thing is that you will never get full-time hours. The people there are very nice and management is as accommodating as they can be."
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work, however, they have a tendency of not employing enough workers to meet the customer demand. This makes for an often hectic work environment where the customer is upset and takes it out on the workers. Training is pretty limited initially before they throw you out to the floor. From there you are on your own to get the information you need to do your job well. Co-workers are not trained to train, nor are there any benefits for them to train others, so it becomes a challenge to get the help needed. So if you can make it through the first six months or so of mistakes and frustration it will be great."
good,Lowe's was a very good position to have as you traverse the job market but not for long term unless you seek advancement from within.  Overall good gig.
good,"Lowes was a nice place to work. The insurance they offer is bare minimum. Managers for the most part were wonderful, there are always going to be bad apples. The store manager, Steve, best manager I have ever had the pleasure for working for. He did love his employees and made sure everyone knew and felt that way. There are fun holiday and bonding events and the company really does love our veterans and service members. It is a good place to work if income isn't dire. But it was one of the worse cases of bullying among coworkers I have experienced."
good,"I was responsible for the unloading and stocking of the products which arrived nightly from our delivery service.  My hours were 4am - 9am on Monday through Friday.  After the store was open for business, I would assist the customers with any needs they might have."
good,Overall a good company. Many positions available and opportunity for growth. The company is undergoing many changes and is looking for new faces. They have good benefits.
good,The primary responsibility of a CSA at Lowe's is to generate revenue and provide a quality in store customer experience. If you missed these goals you were reprimanded.
good,"Pretty good job in the big box company, Nothing to hard but stocking and restocking your department your in and making sure everything looks neat and presentable."
good,Great company and atmosphere to work in. Dealing with customers can get a little frustrating at times but if you do your job and treat people how you want to be treated everything works out
good,"management needed to be harder on those who did no show, no call for their schedule. Overall, the head cashiers were great to work with, most everyone worked as a team."
good,at this particular store management is inconsistent. You’ll have a few managers that are tolerable and then they’re some that talk to you in a condescending tone. There’s so many lazy associates and management prefers to pick on the ones that actually work.
good,"I worked at Lowe's for approximately 6 months, I really enjoyed working there. Unfortunately a 3rd party company took over my position and I was laid off"
good,I'm an under paid super at Lowe's. It's a great place to work as long as your not management with high & nearly impossible expectations. The pay & benefits are really good for retail. Most everyone is great there. I just feel that there's too much of a work load for the low pay as management. I would suggest negotiating negotiating pay on the gigher side.negotiating pay on th
good,"This job is great for young adults, college students, retired , active duty and anyone looking for a part time job. It slow pace and if the same people are there its pretty laid back and chill."
good,"Do your job and you'll be fine, pay increase twice a year, good benefits, and PTO. No set schedule, heavy products, and dusty conditions. Also, power equipment is operated on the sales floor. Management has been a revolving door in my experience, so take what you will."
good,-Helps connecting with more people from diverse community. A typical day consists of handling different kind of online and in-store orders. Getting paces with the customer calls and directing them to desired departments. Well behaved and professional staff helps at each and every step to reach our goals to provide great customer service.
good,Lowe's has been good place to work. I have learned about every aspect of the retail world here. The big corporation gets you ready for a career in retail management.
good,"Great opportunity and great environments to work in, family values lead to a comfortable workplace and willingness to want to come in to work and strive to fulfill job requirements more efficiently"
good,"Rotating shifts. You get the same days off each week but you will work each of the 3 shifts which are morning, mid and closing. It’s very hard to close one night at 11 pm and open the next morning at 6 am. Very hard on family life. You get insurance, paid vacation, 401K, bonuses when the store hits benchmarks and the option to buy company shares."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working with the public and most of the staff, given the responsibilities of a short staff they were eager to help me learn the system and pull orders when I could not due to top stock merchandise as well as responding to customers when I was out pulling orders"
good,I enjoy my time working at Lowe's.  It is a good company with a multitude of opportunities.  That being said I am looking to find a position where I can use acquired skills.  I have extensive experience in human resources from a ground level to a management level;  I know the processes of inventory controls and inventory turns and the value of cycle counting products.  I am recognized for skills in team building and function accomplishing difficult or multifaceted projects.
good,"Cool place to work, will learn and gain experience in multiple areas due to moving around the store. A lot of fun to work at Lowes during the holiday season."
good,"I worked at Lowes for over two years and enjoyed most of that time. I got to work in a good environment with mostly good people. I got paid fairly, and they did their best to accommodate my schedule. Things got a little rough after the new CEO took over. By the time I left I would describe my store as understaffed and overworked, but I don't think every store is like that."
good,"Company is currently transitioning. There is now a mixture of old job duties and new job duties, with no new compensation. Change is always stressful, but it has been months with still no equilibrium."
good,"Job security has been questionable. Unless you are an ASM and up Lowe's management structure is often subject to change. "
good,I really enjoy working with the customers and helping them with their challenges in their projects. It is very rewarding to help them to finish their projects and improve their lives.
good,"My direct manager was great"
good,"Lowe's stores were a nice place to work a family feel among co-workers.  Most workers are very knowledgeable and are willing to help in other areas of the store if necessary. I felt management could be too high strung at times, nick picking and causing loss of morale or good reliable and knowledgeable workers to move on. If you go in with a plan and do your job Lowe's as a company has good incentives, advancement and relocation opportunities if that's something you're looking for."
good,"I was let go from my position in one day, no warning, because they eliminated my position.  I was given no warning, and they cut off my insurance at the same time.  I did not feel this was very professional."
good,I've worked at three different Lowe's before I quit and all of them were a great experience but it all comes down to management of each store that makes it or breaks it. My first store was absolutely amazing. The next two were not that way and made my experience not as great.
good,Lowes is a great company to work for. I have been with the company for 3 years. I would recommend this company to family and friends and appreciate the opportunities I've had to learn new skills while being employed by the company
good,It was a hectic and constantly changing job that requires team work communication and patience with a ability to serve excellent customer service under any circumstances
good,"Offered insurance for part time workers."
good,It was a fun place to work. We most of the time we didn’t have enough people on the floor to handle all the customers and at times it became stressful. But over all I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. Hope the decide to re hire me.
good,They keep you busy. There is always something to be done. You can learn an move up quickly. Everyone is very knowledgeable an is willing to help each other out to help solve problems.
good,It started very great but over time it turned to be more drama then necessary. What’s best is to always focus on your job and use the best team work to accomplish all tasks.
good,"days would go smooth or rough depending on which manager was on the clock that day, the days when certain managers would work, staff had to do ""double"" the work, also after doors closed employees had to wait at the door occasionally for more that 15 minutes after their  shift ended for the managers to open the doors."
good,Lowe's has a great family feel and everyone supports each other. They offer a flexible schedule for family or school. I truly enjoyed my job at Lowe's.
good,The people you work with here are a big part of the job. There’s a lot of teamwork that goes into it. Would highly recommend working here to anyone looking to gain team building skills and working friendships.
good,Lowes is a great company to work for but management systems tend to vary substantially from store to store.  I believe they are doing a very good turn around currently.
good,"As a head cashier, you are constantly on the go. This is not a job for someone who is just wanting to collect a paycheck. You have to be a multi tasker and willing to do more than your job title."
good,productive place to work but the culture of working and being held accountable is lacking the management team is more interested in being friends than building a respectful culture and creation a job security atmosphere for team members.  .
good,"The other employees were great, the management staff not so much. It is very tiring if you are on your feet on concrete all day. Many long time employees suffered with back and hip pain. It takes its toll on your body."
good,"Although each store is different, the overall company is good to work for."
good,"It was rewarding to work for Lowe's, until by position was no longer needed. Lowe's was my second home/family environment. I would recommend Lowe's to those who want to learn something new."
good,Not a bad place to work. The pay is okay. Benefits are pretty good. Fun depends on coworkers and management. Just like any other big box retail store.
good,Lowes can be a great place to work. Like most retail locations it does have it's good days and bad days. Sometimes advances can be difficult to achieve.
good,"I would love to get back on and work for this company. The customers there are kind, I love the environment, much better the Home Depot in my opinion."
good,"If I didnt get an offer for a full time position elsewhere, I would not have left this job. The managers were friendly, co workers were friendly. All in all it was a good job with good pay."
good,"The Lowes Home Improvement Company that I first started working for in 2006 is NOT the same company that exists today. Granted, most companies will undergo some sort of change in their lifetime, I cannot say that these changes were for the better of the company, and certainly NOT for the good of many employees. I was let go due to downsizing within Loss Prevention / Asset Protection department - the only department, to my knowledge, that actually tracked ROI (Return on Investment) and KPIs (Key Productivity Indicators) - and consistently preformed above standards year after year. Within weeks of the downsizing becoming public knowledge, shrink and theft rose tremendously. What was done as a profit making measure has, and will continue to plague large box retailers. The current CEO, and cabinet, of the company have a standing track record of doing the same in the last 2-3 business that they have run into the ground. On the positive side, the average local store, is made up of hard working, everyday folks like yourself, who want nothing more than a job they can do, feel good about (for the most part), get paid, and have reasonable benefits. Many locations embrace a family type mentality and culture, and actually DO try to live by it, within the means of the business. If you like having tight knit relationships with your coworkers, whom you will see slightly more that your actual family, then this is the place to be. Politics of management exist everywhere, but you can steer clear of that nonsense and still enjoy what you do."
good,"The management and HR was very biased when choosing promotions for employees. Hard work, great attitude,  experience and attendance were not a factor in choosing candidates for promotions. Very disappointed. Left the company for a better opportunity."
good,"busy, always short handed, not Lowes fault but it sucks.  Sometimes covering 3-4 departments.  Managers at my store were good and supportive their job sucked when ours did they were just as busy.  Your body takes a beating cement floors and sometimes no breaks.  You work in all weather and temperatures and are lifting, climbing and walking all day."
good,"The company was good with many job related issues, but very high pace retail. Good benefits and plenty of room for advancement. If you put the effort you can move up."
good,They do a lot of cross training.  Only thing I did not like were the low hours.  Try and get on full time and learn all you can.  They will promote from within.
good,Job was easy if you could maintain what you're doing. Everyone was helpful in getting the job done. Bosses were easy to talk to and to accomplish said jobs within the warehouse.
good,Lowe's is a good place to work the management is fair. They do want you to be available when they need you. It's hard to work there if you have more than o e job.
good,"The job began as a temporary job in the summer and then after the minimum number of days (90) you could be called in for a part time position. The hours you work may be lessened due to the switch. The workplace culture is very open and inviting but is also open to switching around. When I worked the managers did a sort of switcheroo in departments, although not being in management I was not sure how they went about determining that. The work-life balance is only poor due to the nature of the job itself. In customer service you could work until close one night and then open the next day but for this job, the latest you would stay is 9 or 10 in the evenings. Job advancement was a bit difficult for me as also was securing for a full time position. This was partially due to the economy being as it is (has been since 2012) and thus proving difficult for companies in general to afford full time employees. They are very much an equal-opportunity employer and a firm believer in affirmative action. Overall, a very positive, progressive and community oriented workplace. I would apply again."
good,"Good place to work  for that help you balance work with life change. My manager work well with her people."
good,"•	Provided facility inspection and maintenance to ensure superior levels of cleanliness and upkeep."
good,Enjoy working for Lowe’s. I made good starting pay and as well was appointed to other duties due to management liking my work ethic. I applied for a higher position and got the promotion
good,Sometimes management can slack off causing your job to be very stressful. Not paid enough for the hard work done by the employees daily.  Good to have high stress tolerance tbh
good,"If you are an even moderately decent worker, you're opportunities for advancement are there. But, unlike in the past you aren't going to become a millionaire. Wages have not increased enough over the years to overcome inflation, while also trying to provide a living for yourself. Unless you get into a management role, or are extremely frugal, you will have virtually no discretionary money. Take advantage of every benefit they offer, including 401k and stock purchase plan. These are two really good benefits to take advantage of."
good,Lowe’s is a great place to work. Competitor salary and benefits . For the most part it’s a family oriented place to work. The associates is a pleasure to provide leadership to. As an assistant manager I have respect from all associates
good,"As the first long-term job I've ever had, I've been very thankful for the opportunities I've had at Lowe's. However, I have to admit that my hours have been very inconsistent and sometimes I only get enough to just cover my insurance. The management staff is often very friendly but recently they've started pushing selling things like credit cards and Extended Protection Plans at the expense of good customer service. Even so, I can't say I haven't enjoyed my time working here, made good connections, and learned useful skills."
good,It was a normal job for a regular high school or college student there wasnt anything bad about it nor good. Its the kind of job you get because you have no expirience
good,"Sometimes the jobs has its quirks that can be a little troublesome but overall a good experience. Management can be a little temperamental depending on the day and who is their boss and their mood. Changes are made when they think things will benefit, but essentially you are sometimes a guinea pig for the changes."
good,"Most recent managers when I left Albany store were lazy people that could care less about employees and how the place was run. Very disorganized at times. They got rid of too many great managers! Dept managers lost their jobs and left no one to help out. Customers got very angry because there was no help out on the sales floor. They had a bad computer system, slow and went down often.  I went through many interviews (even though I already worked there) for different positions and didn’t get any of them. I wanted to transfer or get a different position there for many years."
good,"Not a terrible place, though your experience will vary heavily depending on your coworkers. Having worked multiple positions at multiple locations, and having had friends work at even other locations, you can have a great work experience or an absolutely terrible one. Management is usually good, but they are severely limited by a tangled network at corporate which prevents them from properly hiring and keeping great employees. They are also currently going through a massive restructuring program that has led to many employees being laid off, some receiving no notice. Overall, the individual stores are usually a great place to work, though some are ruined by terrible coworkers, but they are all limited by an absolutely horrid corporate structure that fails to communicate properly to its stores."
good,I have worked at Lowe’s for nineteen years and it has drastically changed some good some bad everything has changed I wished that all these programs that corporate put in place would be tested out by corporate because some do not work very good Morale is at a all time low because we never have enough people working in each department customers have to wait around becathone assthat one t
good,Worked good alone without any management over looking my work. There was communication problems between managers and associates. To many heads at one time.
good,"over all lowes is a great company to work for. Lowes was my first retail job and iv been there for 5 years and still going strong. I Love the customers and employees we are all a big family. Recently alot of change is going on and not too many are happy about it, but that's what retail is all about. I do recommend working for lowes as I personally have never had any problems."
good,"Came in checked my area for cleanliness and cleaned if needed, checked schedule for the day.  Checked all beverages and snack, fill if needed or put on to do list. Checked with other head cashiers to see if there are any phone orders to be completed. Management I have found will not back you up when you are trying to enforce the policy and procedures."
good,"A typical day is honestly just standing at the register, ringing people out, which can get kind of boring, but it's not bad. Hardest part of the job is just knowing where everything is. Best part of the job is the dogs that come through your line at checkout!"
good,"Reasonable experience,would apply again in the future, chances for supervisor positions are declining and I experienced too much favoritism by some of the management team"
good,"its easy to get stressed out with all the deadlines given, and managers seem to get given more to do than they can handle on their own, other than tht easy place to work"
good,Loved it but just found a higher paying job. Would go back to work there in the future. It was fast paced at times and slow at times but the hours would go by fast because it would get busy all of a sudden and by the time you knew it it was time to go to lunch or go home.
good,"This was the first job that got me power equipment certification. However, there is a rather big disconnect between the day and night shift, as the night shift only had 5 people working it."
good,I worked there for many years and they were good to me in working and when they phased out my position. They were not focused on training as much as they should have been.
good,"I have worked in an office for 20 years, It was hard standing all day."
good,My experience at Lowe's has been a pleasant one. Would recommend this job to others. Lowe's is a company that is family friendly. Great job advancement opportunities.
good,"Will elaborate upon interview."
good,It was a fun place to work and I loved what I did. Coworkers were great and store management was fair but firm. Individual store perks for employees were phenomenal.
good,"I worked for LOWES in both Va  and La Quinta. There is a 180 degree contrast  between the two regions. The Woodbridge store was a million dollar store. This meant that they had a complete overnight crew which would stock the store for the next business day. This way the specialist could come in the AM and complete whatever the required reporting was for that day before the store opened. The management at this store was incredible."
good,Must be ready for the day and work fast. Helping customers get to the correct products. Didnt like that I had to do odd computer trainings before or after my shift
good,Lowes provides individuals with a variety of opportunities within departments as well as leadership prospects. Management is available to assist with employee development and support.  Employees are always willing to give a helping hand to customers and other employees as well.
good,"Working as a team means working along side each other and having fun while doing your job. But when you have 4 different people telling you what to do and nobody seems to agree, that can make your job more confusing. But working hard gets you nowhere when you see everyone else just talking and playing on there phone. But you have to look past it and just keep doing what you do and people do noticed to works hard."
good,"You are often helping with loading, locating and explaining things to customers. There's a lot of things to learn for each department, and there are often products that are relevant across multiple departments."
good,"Lowe's Home Improvement is a great place to work at. Lowes offers great benefits and good pay. The work environment is good, all employees work collaborative."
good,"Great people to work with, some management takes too much control! The culture is all about safety, but there are times where money is more important than what they wanting for culture."
good,The Gordonsville location has great people and only so-so management. Most managers are willing to work with you on scheduling and advancement opportunities if you show initiative. Most.
good,"Retail corporation. Must be available to work any time store is open. Could be 5 a.m. or there until 11 p.m..  Weekends and holidays. If you like retail and don't mind the crazy schedule, it is a good place to work."
good,My days would consist of walking around the store and helping guests find the product they want and show them items they may need. I learned how to operate forklifts. I didn't enjoy all of the managers but some of them were okay. The work culture is somewhat negative because it seems like nobody wants to work. I really enjoyed my position and the flexibility I had to do what I wanted to do.
good,"My store had 10 Store Managers in 12 years, upper management was has not been stable."
good,"Helping customers ,making out work lists. Some days are more stressed then others.When I was there I would have employees coming to me customers and managers all at once so got a little stressed at times. I did love my job though. There was always something to learn. My most enjoyable of the job was dealing with the customers"
good,The management is a little here and there but the people are all really good. The work is a little taxing and sometimes it's a blind rush to just get your job done.
good,"A good place to work at, some things could be better like more hours and more career advancement options. Would also recommend for any 18 year olds for a first job."
good,"Good Company to work for.  Generally stressful, but always felt I was appreciated.  Ended up getting laid off. I can't blame lowes since my location needed to be closed.  Honestly would have applied for another location if it was within range of my home."
good,Its a decent place to work for a beginner job. They put safety and the customers needs first. Training could be done better before you get sent out on your own. Very friendly people.
good,"There are a lot of people at Lowe's who really care about great customer service and career advancement."
good,"Just be about good work ethics."
good,"I had a good time working here in my role as a driver. We had a more flexible and easygoing culture than maybe some of the other departments. More times than not, we were self-supervised when out on the road. All we had to do was our job, not unlike anyone else, but we were not in the store environment. We were the face of the company so what we did and how we conducted ourselves reflected back to the company 10 fold so we were always respectful and professional with every customer."
good,"The hardest part about this job is balancing work and life. It is hard to do much during the day when you return home from work exhausted at 7 am. Although the hours are hard, the awesome co-workers and manager I had during the job made it worth it."
good,"Pretty good company to work for. Gets crazy in the summer. I worked here while I was in college. I had flexible hours, but I don't think that is the norm for the other employees."
good,Its a good place to work. Work with my availability. I would like to find another job bc the wont give more hours. Dome good people to work with. Love my customers
good,"I was asked to do the job of multiple people. for example, I was asked to run returns, do regular cashier jobs, work with online orders, answer customer service phone calls."
good,"Good company with lots of benefits"
good,"Lowe's has a unique culture that is passive-aggressive from a management point of view.  In some instances, they are afraid to make decisions, commitments or say exactly what they think.  There is a good chance to make work friendships and enjoy a healthy job tenure.  However, there is always the possibility that your job will be changed or eliminated based on the latest corporate thinking on what your job, or you, should be.  For instance, there was at one time the idea that ""agility"" was a top level requirement for managers.  The definition of ""agility"" took on many forms within the organization and caused the demise of many productive and knowledgeable people.  Also, youth was a premium over experience."
good,"Not for everyone but if you like a fast paced environment and are good at multitasking it could work for you. It can be fun at times and stressful as well, but a good balance of both"
good,A good place to start gaining customer service knowledge. If you're going to school they do work with your schedule. Make sure you request days at least a month in advanced
good,"I would recommend it for anyone looking for a part-time college job. Great staff and work schedule, very flexible for school. They offer great benefits like tuition reimbursement."
good,The atmosphere was great and pleasing to come to work. Your co-workers were always there to help and guide you if needed. Physically the work was easy and tasks were given ample time to execute them.
good,Skeleton crew with busy season. High over turn rate in many departments. Management told to be hands off with helping on registers. Health benefits are iffy depending on full time or part time.
good,My review for Lowe’s is that is a good place to work and they pay Good for hourly there are very good workers and they help each other out and are always there for each other.
good,Overall I love the company. I only wish they would give their current employees a chance at other positions that are opened within the store. They also don't promote to easily especially to full time. This is one reason why I am looking for other employment. I do not want to leave Lowe's so I am just wanting another part time at the moment. I can't make it on less than 30 hours a week. And no advancement opportunities are available for everyone.
good,Lowes can be a good place to work depending on the store you are in and the district Manager that you work for.  There are a lot of great people working for the company.  It is sometimes hard to have a work/life balance and can be stressful at times.
good,"It was an enjoyable job with decent pay to get me through my early years of College. Not to terribly stressful, management was helpful with any issues that popped up or needed help with."
good,A day at Lowe's was always filled with hard work and training. You never knew what was going to happen.Customers always came first and our work came 2nd.
good,I enjoy working here. But at my store all cashiers are not treated equal. If you are friends with Head Cashier then you get better treatment. Some get to stay up front all the time. While the rest of us get sent to the garden center and lumber department.
good,"Wouldn’t have left if they hadn’t cut my hours "
good,Worked as a delivery person so in the morning you had to get everything ready to go out that day. Then set the truck up to get the deliveries out faster without any time wasted. Had to be decently strong to carry washers and dryers upstairs if necessary.
good,Great place to work especially helping customers with there home . Not much of a work life balance . Everyone is nice and freindly easy job. Alot of room for growth
good,"Lowes is a great place to work in my opinion, my co workers and managers are great people and get things done. Thanks to the managers the store is run in an awsome way because everyone works as a team, even when the employees are by themselves they do a great job of getting things done. I couldnt be more thankful for them letting me be apart of their team."
good,"I ran daily till balances, till audits, and filed paperwork for management. I worked part-time on the weekends while pursuing my degree. Lowe's was willing to work with me on my school schedule."
good,"Good company to work for and great people just be warned Delivery shifts are brutal if your single and fresh out of school this is perfect for you cause you have no life not to mention high laber typical good day your lookin at a 8 or 9 hour shift bad day your lookin at 15 hours if your lucky generally go in at 5am. And they do not care if you work 15 hours they expect you to show up the next day. "
good,"Store 1050, 2605 were OK, for me as the class a delivery driver, as long as ,one, does not mind : coming in at 0530 pulling all appliances for contract Delivery,  thenn begin on flatbed loads,  normally not pulled by dept. Normally getting finished around 1830-2000. Overtime was common thing. "
good,"This is a good place to work.  They value leadership.  Customer service is #1 and if you support sales, your future is bright.  They are working hard to make sure that they are #1 in the marketplace."
good,"It was an excellent place to work with great benefits until they started restructuring and then job security became questionable and now things are shaking.  I feel like I need to get out while I can, before things get worse.  Management is okay but is better or worse depending on what store you are at.  Benefits and pay are great!"
good,Lowes is definitely a company  that will increase your knowledge of retail and teach you how to address challenges presented by customers as well as employees.
good,"If your young, the job may help you a lot because you are younger. The company didn't support me because I was older. Hopefully, if your younger, you can have a long career."
good,"A typical day at work included after clocking in, reading assignment for the day and proceed with unloading and stocking. They give you the opportunity to learn more."
good,Lowes is a great company although they demand a chunk of your time/life. Their mission statement is great! Pay is good. I’d work there again under different circumstances.
good,Would not mind working there again. Had understanding and support from management when needed. Benefits were good. Didn't spread you too thin. Clean environment and generally enough staff to help with tasks.
good,Management could be better.  I have learned a lot about leadership and working with others. Very inclusive work culture. Expect to do hard labor.  Fun
good,Love the company fun place to work. Managment could use some work. Room for advancement is  basically nonexistent  Due to people staying in the same role for years
good,"Lowe's is a very fast paced workplace that is a friendly environment to work in with advancement if you want to invest time and work odd shifts.  Management can be approachable, but also unavailable a lot of times."
good,"Working for Lowes for the better part of 5 years I have noticed some trends that seem to happen.  They mean well but have poor long term execution.  Lowes likes to come out with new plans and better ideas from sales objectives to bonus programs to even schedules.  These thing usually only last for a few months and it is back to the drawing board.  The hardest thing about working there is the inconsistent schedule.  Its not un-common to work a different time each day of the week and recently they have turned away from the rotation they had for days off."
good,"i have learned how sale flooring to customer. "
good,"I worked in returns/Customer Service and it was a pretty okay job probably the only job I have actually enjoyed working at but the ladies in my area were awful. They talked smack about everyone and then would be fake right at their faces. It was bad enough that I had to deal with cranky customers, I did not need their drama too. But anyways I did meet a lot of wonderful people, aside from my section. That was probably what kept going. It matters if you have good coworkers working with you not against you."
good,Team work and punctuality drives business in Lowes.A fast paced continuous learning environment.Valuable training and mentorship to improve your career.
good,"None. Employees are not fully compensated nor given adequate opportunities. The location I worked was so hostile by a couple of older employees at the location"
good,"have to be patient with a lot of rude customers. management are not helpful. however, job security is great. working with other employees is good. you get two 15min breaks and 30-60min lunch break."
good,"My life working at Lowe's overall has been challenging and life changing, community and Leaders with Lowe's helped me to Change and Be who I say I Am!"
good,It was a good job til the manager realized i had tattoos then it became more of a part time job for me my hours started to get lower and lower but the people were great the money was good and this was one of my fav jobs
good,not a good place to move up if your wanting to move up. the management are very rude. the front end is ran like a boot camp and the hr doent know what shes doing
good,"The job is a lot fun, lots of diversity among employees. The staff wasn't as pleasant to work with. The schedule rotated but wasn't very flexible, and time off was difficult to earn."
good,It was a very welcoming place yet the managers made me feel like I wasn’t good enough at my job and I’m constantly being pushed to do something even though I know exactly what I need to do but overall I do like working here
good,"Clock in and help customers. Stock shelves, build displays, and follow the SOP. Call customers about their orders. Implement changes from upper management. Retail"
good,It’s a good place to work but they demand you do over 100% each and every day which can be hard depending on the trailer you get each day.  You have to work hard and fast.  If the product is stacked from floor to ceiling and mixed it slows you down and if you have to get stack racks it slows you down even more
good,"good place to work i recommend, but there are cons just like every job. New CEO is one of them.. most days are busy in customer service. most of the time we are short handed having to deal with angry/sometimes nice customers and phone calls."
good,I enjoyed working there because it was a good job. I started out in lumber for about a year after that I got in delivery. just a over all good job. the people down there were good people they helped you when you needed it.
good,Adquirir mucha experiencia acerca de los materiales de construcción que hay en el mercado ya que lo consideraba importante para la carrera que estudié.
good,"If you enjoy the hours and dealing with multitudes of people and believe you belong in retail, Lowe's is not a bad choice for the long run. There are incentives for those willing to work hard, put in the hours, and work as a team."
good,"As a loader, heavy lifting was a requirement and they are very busy during this time of year. However, you could possibly earn tips while working outside."
good,"Largest challenge was to implement a new sales support system replacing an old legacy system.  Took longer than expected."
good,"Good environment nice people. Good possibility  of chances to grow. "
good,"I had all my fingers in the pie.  I was competent in the Reach, Order Picker and Fork Lift.  I was captain of the Voice Team, and Safety Committee.  I was called upon to explain the Lowe's culture to new hires. I have a CDL-A driver license.  I was Department Manager of 6 different departments within 2 Lowe's stores and guided dozens of employees for additional responsibilities within the company."
good,"Great employees to work with."
good,I had a great job as a project specialist but they did away with the position company wide. I enjoyed the challenges  of my position. Meeting new people and helping them in their  home remodel.
good,"Show up, work hard, show competence, and get rewarded with potential overtime. Every store has such a different atmosphere based on the leadership team."
good,Lowe's isn't a place to work if you aren't salary. They base the hours pretty much off the seasons. So if its cold your hours will be down versus the summer time.
good,LOWES a place to help people love where they live it was so exciting working there because you see the happiness in people faces after helping them find the things that they need
good,"Typical day was okay if you are organized personnel.Management was reasonable, Associates were always helpful.Workforce was always in and out due to various reasons which effects day to day operations."
good,"I worked in the Deli Department"
good,opportunity for advancement and good pay. working with customers to make their dreams come true is one of the best parts of this job. install services provided can really make the customer experience great.
good,I have been at Lowe’s for 15 years I am just ready for a normal schedule.  They are starting a new program and we will not have a set schedule and will not be able to plan trips.
good,"I feel that Lowe's is generally a good company to work for. However, many people are hired as seasonal help and then let go. Peak season is very physically demanding. Customers often complain about waiting for assistance long periods of time. I worked in different departments learning many aspects of the store and the merchandise they sell."
good,Most of all the staff is friendly and helpful but even the best can have an off day. They do try and give everyone and chance to work there.           other then a few hiccups here and there its a great place
good,"Great place to work overall. Treated like Family and there is always someone available to assist you when needed. Work/ life balance can be a challenge at times, but what job isn’t ."
good,"Plenty of opportunity to grow and develop. Company offers quarterly bonus potential for sales and customers focus, as well as healthcare to full and part-time associates. They also offer discount discounts through 3rd party vendors as well as an employee discount in the store and online."
good,Worked at a lowes for 6yrs.  Enjoyed my co-workers very much and must say that lowes has an environment that makes it easy to meet people.  I felt a closeness wtih the people I worked with like a family.  Depending on your area and how rude the customers are lowes is a great place to be employed
good,Great place to work if you are a college student. My experience was pleasant except when it was time to cut hours (sometimes only 16 hours a week at full time)
good,"If you start at a low rate, you'll stay at a low rate. Market level management can be opaque. Too many chiefs at times. Lots of changes which negatively affect morale."
good,Company is very respectful of its people .Diversity is very important.My management style is based on coaching and development .Lowes has given me great opportunities and everything I’ve learned I’ve implemented into my management style.
good,The job can be hard and stressful if you let it be. take pride in your work and do your best and that's all you can do. the job it self is a stressful job. just got to take each task as it comes and get it done. good benefits and ok pay but i would have a stayed if i got paid or actually let you bargain when trying to move up in the company.
good,"Good place to work if you are a hands on person, a lot of different types of tools and building materials to use.  Managers I worked with were lazy which caused work to pile up."
good,Lowes is a good company to work for. Benefits are offered to ALL employees and the pay is decent. The company appreciates their employees. I would recommend this company to family and friends.
good,"This was a great but boring place to work at. The manager and supervisor were great people and would work out any problems you had. The only gripe I have about this place is I was in college at the time, a part-time worker here yet they were giving me full time hours because it was their busy time of the year."
good,A good company with a lot of changes in a very short period of time.  The management and customer service levels are different from store-to-store.  Overall not a bad company.
good,"Like all retail, the work experience is about the people you work with more than where you work.  Lowe's was always trying to improve, so It was good that way."
good,"New Leadership provides reason for optimism in the future.  The company really does provide good benefits for employees, but the salaries are not competitive enough to retain top talent."
good,Great company with great benefits. Hours are irregular. Hectic at times. I enjoy interacting with customers in this position. Hardest part of the job is the irregular hours. Workplace culture is good; coworkers are friendly and helpful.
good,Each store is different.  This is due to how the store is run by the current management.  I worked at 2 different stores for my 4 years of Lowes work and had 3 different managers. What kind of manager really does change how you enjoy your job.  Some care alot others dont.  So ask around the store to see how current management is.
good,"I want to start with the fact that I have always enjoyed my work at Lowe's and the people I worked with up until the huge corporate restructuring started taking place. Lately, in store management has been squeezing as much as they can out of each employee to a breaking point that has lead to an overall decreased morale. There is a palpable fear and many people have been asking what happens next. The direction of the company is good, but the execution really makes me wonder how they are going to do it."
good,"I worked a t two locations in Millworks. At the first location I was being considered for promotion to Contractor sales. But then, the manager I worked for relocated to another state. So I transferred to a new store opening close to home. The manager had some personal issues, and after a while, I was offered more money to leave for another opportunity, so I left, but I am elegible for re hire."
good,"Co-workers are very helpful, and management tries to entertain new ideas but corporate decides what merchandise we carry.  Lowe's works only with certain vendors, which I think is a good idea as being in sales there are certain options from the store, or you also have the ability to sell custom orders.  Sales and customer service is part of their mantra.  I also believe this is essential in being successful for repeat business.  There are also quarterly bonuses if your department exceeds forecasted numbers.  Working at Lowe's is a very strenuous job, up and down on ladders, lifting very heavy items, over 50 lbs.  After you pass background and drug test, the 6 week training is excellent.  The work culture instills a team effort, working with many different types of customers and understanding their needs can be challenging but there is always a solution.  Overall, for a big box retail chain, I would give this a positive experience."
good,it is a fun place to work at most of the time . You have good and bad Managers but you have that everywhere . I love doing my job but than I;m working with a great Team so that helps a lot
good,I enjoyed my time at Lowe's. It taught me much of what I know about customer service. I also learned alot about the home improvement world with a specialty in professional services offered.
good,"A typical day of work was overwatching other cashiers, and making sure that they could figure out difficult situations. Other roles is making decisions when a product was under priced/deals. I learned that I could get a team that had difficulties working together could to be brought together to push towards our goals. The hardest part of the job was working with the computer system, and determing issues with it."
good,Upper management can be very inconsistent.  Benefits are good and as company it's great.  Good place to work overall but work/life balance is hard to maintain.
good,Nice place to work when going to school.Different positions are available. They're very big on safety. When closing you might leave early or stay late depending on the sales.
good,I feel the management style is very cliquish.  They have their chosen few employees who advance quickly.  A few of  senior management is known to spread harmful gossip about other employees that affects their ability to advance.  I feel I am being discriminated against because of my age because all the promoted people are extremely young and inexperienced.
good,Like my job. We're just limited on hours we get with no chance of getting full-time in the position I'm in. I'd like to work a 40 hr work week. Management is not on point.
good,Its a ok job if you are just looking for a partime. Workers are nice and there to help you with what you need. Its a good enviroment to work. Its just the short hours. It would be good for someone that goes to school and need a little hours to work after school.
good,"One on one customer interaction with much learned on your own."
good,"I have heard good, and I have heard bad. It really depends on your immediate managers, and the type of customers that you deal with. In my experience, most of the problems comes from co-workers."
good,Needed more employees to cover both specialists and regular employees vacation/ holidays. More training needed to be in place to ensure all employees are doing everything right for the customers.
good,I was made fun of a lot during my last few weeks of working here because I am a little different than others. It led to me getting laid off. Everything else was ok.
good,"Good place to work, typical day is 8 hours and not a minute longer, management was good, I really enjoyed helping out the customer base they had their."
good,"It was and currently is a good experience however the overnight crew I work with is poorly staffed and over worked. Everyone gets along for the most part, some people are lazy and some are not but that's what you get everywhere."
good,The place is family friendly and flsxiabke around your schedule if part time. The benefits are pricey but good. The company understands things come up and dont make you feel bad for kissing.
good,Staff was always welcoming and friendly. Awesome management and fun working environment. Working with a great group of people made working there fun. Great
good,"I worked at Lowes for over a year, learned a lot about the company, my department , and made lasting friendships with my coworkers.  It is a good company to work for and enjoyable."
good,This company provides a relaxed yet productive working environment. Well organized and usually fun to work with staff. Offers flexible working hours and provides a sense of purpose.
good,"This particular location is great. We are currently understaffed, and that makes it hard a lot of the time. Hopefully we will be back up to full staff soon."
good,"Will be working with both vary nice customers and people, but also mean and nasty ones also. Need to be ferm but nice at all time and try to keep a smile even in slow parts."
good,Not a bad place to work. Part time has excellent benefits and the management is ok. Depending on what department your in and the optimism you bring to work determines your day dealing with customers.
good,"A typical day at work was working with lots of different people helping them to pick out wall tiles, flooring, Kitchen cabinets and appliances.  Management was nice.  Workplace culture did get stressful at times from the higher management  needing better profits from the floor but that is typical.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the cabinetry clients and assisting in building them beautiful kitchens.  The hardest part of the job was picking up the floor tiles and moving them around.  The most enjoyable part was working at the computer program that helped me to design someones kitchen."
good,"overall is a good place to work , family oriented , meet new people and learn new things each and every day. learnd a lot of sale skills and improved on my communication skills"
good,I loved working there and got to learn a lot about the paint dept.  My main focus was helping the customer with finding the right paint for there weekend project.
good,"If you can get past the occasional bad customer then this job will be a cake walk. I did it as a temporary summer job, but there is room to get put on to a full time position if you are a hard worker."
good,"I enjoy my employment with Lowe's however we have a long way to go in regards to transparency and technology downfalls. Right now it is even up in the air whether or not HRMs will continue to have a job after Monday. We have a meeting scheduled to tell us our fates. To me, this is unacceptable. That information should have been cascaded down to us as it affects us. If our positions are to be cut, it gives us limited time to make plans. As a company that constantly does restructures, transparency is a must."
good,"I was hired by the store general manager for a department manager trainee position. The store manager changed. The new manager found me to be valuable at my position on flooring specialist and would not allow the promotion to management, so I gave my notice and left."
good,I liked Working At Lowe’s It Was Very Cool & Relaxed The People That Work With You Are Fun Angry People & Weilling To Help If Needed. Lowe’s Will Work With You Around Schedule Problems Etc.
good,Dont get paid enough for the area I live in. Love the people I work with- manager in receiving is amazing. The benefits are amazing but priced a little high- a lot taken out of paycheck. Incentives are pretty good. Our bonuses keep going down which doesnt help us any.
good,"The environment was extremely fast paced with key focus to keep the turn around times down without compromising accuracy of the 2020 designs. "
good,"I worked overnight stock. It was fun depending on which,  manager was working. Certain times you could listen to music have small snacks and water or juice. I had nice fun co-workers and ok management."
good,"Good benefits, good pay for the work. Management could use more support. Cashier's need more breaks or at least the freedom to sit when customer's are not present."
good,"Lowe's as a whole is a great company to work for, however, my company in specific was very unorganized and needed more help management wise. Great for students!"
good,"At no point under the current store manager have I felt like he has ever taken into account how the employees in my department feel; at no point has he come to us and asked how the department is and what we need to make the job better. I have routinely closed three departments by myself, even after repeated emails to management requesting more help or a staunch increase in pay. As of my writing this, neither has occurred."
good,I enjoy working for Lowes Home Improvement.  I learned a lot daily about the job. I delivered appliances. Lowes Home Improvement s is a good place to work.
good,"I only work about 5 hrs a on the weekend. I water plants, help customers, help employees. I think when they schedule, should over lap. I like my job and the people I work with."
good,"No reward for a job well done"
good,I found the upper staff to be encouraging and kind.  They went above and beyond to celebrate store victories (Example: accident free lunches).  Was supportive of a family emergency.
good,"My coworkers at this Lowes never made me feel unwelcome or intimidated, with one exception. Overall, I had a good time working there even though it was vastly different from my other jobs with much more manual labor."
good,I like the money the people that I worked with were very nice. It was a great environment for family’s to come and shop for home good and gardening supplies
good,when working at Lowes I really loved this job it was my first job and they started your pay off really good it just I didn't receive a lot of hours and plus It was  a seasonal job. it wasn't hard at all and I enjoyed everything about it .
good,"The overall feeling at my store is that no one really cares to be there, therefore the help needed isn't always available. Management is quick to point out mistakes but don't offer solutions."
good,My customer service experience made being a cashier a good fit. There were time where we were very busy. They would open another register if more than 3 people were in line. Working at evening/night in Pro Services/Lumber area was very slow.
good,"Very Friendly Employees, but not very forthcoming with information in the company. Down stocking was a major thing, Reading boxes about 12-20 feet in the air"
good,"Lowe’s has the potential to be a wonderful company to work for, but in my experience they take advantage of eager and willing employees. The managers have no clue what is going on and it shows."
good,"Some days things are calm and relaxed, more often everything's on fire and we're getting yelled at to fix it. we use two systems, ones from the mid 80's, the other is terriable."
good,Management does not work for whats best for the team and plays favorites alot. Never had the same goals as to making our work day more time efficient.
good,"Lowes is a wonderful place to work,  There are many places for advancement especially if your young and hardworking.  They offer classes for customer service to plumbing... everything. I enjoyed working the garden center the most. I was outside with all the plants and trees. absolutely wonderful"
good,"It can be busy or it can be slow you meet customers of all walks of life who have there own stories to tell. The hours feel long because the standing can make your feet hurt. It is sometime frustrating on your part communicating with customers or having to wait three hours of more for a break. The people are fantastic mainly and they do work with you, but the down fall is not enough hours."
good,I work for Lowe's for so long I enjoy what I did and most of all my schedule. after all the good management team left and the ones that was there was useless you only got treated good if you was one of the employee that kiss A--. But if you have a great and fair management team its a great place to work as long as they work with you and not walk around talking on the phone and don't answer when you need them.
good,"ringing up customer purchases"
good,"Lowe's gives you the opportunity to train in and transfer to the various areas of their store. they recognize their hard workers and comment on those that do good work. Compensation and hours, as of late, leave something to be desired. The hiring process at my store is terrible."
good,"As far as most store managers went, they were wonderful. However, cashier managers were notorious for their poor treatment of cashiers. Overlooking that detail, it was a great environment with nice co-workers, teamwork, and amazing interaction between employees and customers. Management usually supported their employees advancing in even minor ways that contributed to the store's reputation with great customer service."
good,They could be up front and honest with someone but they don’t even know what they are doing.( managers ) if I could have got what they said I would get in the beginning I would be little more happy but they did not.
good,The company tries hard and fails.  The management is promoted from within and therefore ends up being friends get the promotions.  This creates problems because people are not qualified nor capable of the jobs they hold.  Managers are not held accountable and do not follow up with problems when brought to them.  There are good people there.  There are good jobs.  The good jobs pay fair.  The company hires at $10 an hour on average and still won't hire enough people to have a person in every department from open to close.  A single person could be covering 1-2 departments and have lunches/breaks to leave those departments un-covered.  One would expect at such a low pay the company could afford enough employees to keep each department staffed.
good,Lowes was a good company to work for. They treated you as family. Schedule was difficult to plan around but great benefits. I was in 3 different departments maintaining store  appearance a provided excellent customer service to shoppers.
good,I have worked for lowes for 3 and a half years. Its a good place to work for but they really need to be more choosey on who gets managment position in my opinion.
good,its an alright place to work. i have worked worse places. the people that work there make lowes a much more enjoyable place to work. the management sorta sucks.
good,"I sincerely enjoyed my time working at Lowe’s. The management I was handed, was poor, the advancement was negligible in my sector and if advancement in other areas were offered, management looked down upon subordinates for switching roles."
good,I absolutely love working for Lowe’s.  Feels like you’re part of a family. They’re constantly changing things so you have to be open for it and adapt quickly
good,"Challenging and enjoyable.  Customer service skills put to the test on a regular basis.  Co-workers and management always ready to pitch in and help out,"
good,"I love this company.  I have over a years experience, 3 lowes stores in 3 separate markets,  and an additional  5 years experience  in the construction industry. You may get a bad manager  who is worthless, but the struggle  is worth the reward."
good,Lowes is a very high pace environment.  They put focus on customer service and sales as well as providing customer's with solutions to whatever issue they might have.
good,"Customer service."
good,it was a good place to work. the hours are flexible which is great if you are in college like i was. overall it is a great college job to have and i believe that there is room for advancement in the company.
good,"My Job was productive, fun, fast paced, and a good workout. i learned how to operate heavy machines such as forklifts and stand up riders, i also learned how to load and unload trucks.The hardest part of the job was reaching your daily goal percentage and maintaining it. The most enjoyable part of my job was operating the equioment."
good,"Being prepared for customers in the kitchen cabinet department was first on my list in order to being of service to all customers.  Learning enough information from all departments helped me in assisting customers.  Management did their best to maintain the hectic work load fun and informative to all employees since Lowe's is truly a warehouse.  The hardest part of working at Lowe's is lack of assistance due to not enough coverage.  The best part of the job was interacting with customers, building a relationship with them during the stages of a project and closing the sale.  While delivering excellence of service customers left happy, looking forward to their new kitchen in progress.  I made sure they received the right tools, product knowledge and selection, and information of the programs Lowe's offers to help them with their project.   I also enjoyed participating in their arts events as an artist for upcoming holidays, etc."
good,Do more with less.  Lots of moving parts with this company.  Staffing is biggest challenge to implement all programs.  Can build good friendships.  Need to find the right manager to excell.
good,"Lowes as a company is fairly straightforward.  It is a serviceable gap job.  However, the pay is severely low and the hours are very unstable.  One month you may work 2-3 hours over every single day.  The next month they're telling you to stay home 3-4 days a week.  Very unstable."
good,"Lowe's has excellent benefits and support while offering career advancement opportunities. Overall, I would rate this a good place to work, gain business knowledge and work toward advancement."
good,Great place to work for! Would recommend any body to work for! Great envoriment.Will work around 2 jobs. Great managament! Great discounts for employees.
good,"la cultura laboral esta bien desarrollada, pero, el hecho de tener que pedir permiso para renuncia o que te la hagan dificil para renunciar eso si es algo incomodo. Compañeros que te reportan por pequeñas cosas Lowes hermosillo puede ser el que más venda de la Republica mexicana pero el equipo de trabajo no es el mejor son muy inmiscuidos."
good,"thank god they have a new store manager now"
good,Great place to work with a lot of friendly people. Awesome benefits and great flexibility with schedules. The management tries to help out as much as possible.
good,"It's hard to get a full time job there. The hours are not very flexible. So alot of people stay part time. But if you stay long enough you might get full time. It can be stressful at some points specially when summer hits and your short staff. Alot of people leave at that point. but it slows down by fall and thats when you lose your hours. "
good,"great job and great people, downsizing. Lowes is going in a different direction than when i joined them in March of 2014. i need to be with customers, sharing what i know about lawn and garden with them"
good,"Not all of the management at Lowes was horrible.. but a couple in particular only caused issues. Constant harassment of employees, and the typical ""power trip""."
good,"great place if you like working with customers to achieve their projects. very hard work stressful management positions. As a manager a lot of responsibilities. Communication was not always clear. not very good communication from regional level, to distrct level, to store manager."
good,"Stayed busy, there is always something to do. My direct supervisor was amazing. Upper management is to concerned about keeping their jobs and /or receiving their bonuses to worry about helping employees."
good,"Always busy in keeping up with the Back End receiving and double checking the work of the crew scanning in the merchandise.  On the phone many times with customer and companies making delivery appointments and with order corrections ie overages and shortages.  My receiving team looks to me as their ""go to"" person for answers on any questions they have regarding their jobs, accuracy and general questions on Lowes policies.  Most demanding part of the job is when we have more than 3 truck deliveries at a time which requires me to sort them out due to importance and appointment times.  I enjoy the satisfaction of ending up the week with all the reports I am responsible done, all the merchandise is checked in accurately and the crew in synch with Lowes procedures.  I also enjoy training people on various parts of their and my jobs to ensure proper handling of the paperwork during my vacation absences."
good,I work at lowes for about 7 years I enjoyed opportunity being a cashier returned S service this and gave me a great opportunity to finally go to home depot to have the same experience
good,"Lowes was not a bad place to work for. The work was steady and overtime was offered. The company culture on the other hand is disappointing. You wont find it in any hand book, but the culture is someone else will do my job for me."
good,"Good, solid company which will be a big market player. Internal restructuring has led to an exodus of key personnel in stores. Moral is being affected by this."
good,"I worked at Lowe's as a seasonal employee and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a very relaxed yet fast paced place to work, and by that I mean there are times where it's an extremely slow day so all you really have to do is make sure your department is clean and stocked; on the other hand though, when it's going its REALLY going. Overall I referred several of my friends to work there and those that tried it out also said they enjoyed it."
good,I love working there and being a leader for the associates and helping to provide great customer service for the past ten years and really became like family which each person in the store and I feel it’s time for me to grow and further advance my career as a manager
good,"Tough work, but the managers were very responsive and listened. They would organize the routes well, so you wouldnt have to drive from one side of the county to the other. "
good,"As with all retail jobs this one makes it hard to have a work/life balance, this is because their business is based on customers doing projects during their free time and your job is to help them with all their home improvement needs.  To put it simply When you are off everybody is working and when everybody is working you are off.  There are a few set schedules but by and large you will be working a rotating schedule with set days off by no consistent time frame.  All full timers will get 39 hours guaranteed but part time hours will vary widely between 10-30 depends on the needs of the store.  That is the key phrase when working for Lowe's ""based on the needs of the store"".  I still found the job very rewarding when helping a customer solve a plumbing issue or completing a bathroom remodel project."
good,Lowes is a good place but if I can get a job that pays and gives better hours where I'm not working till midnight every night.  I'm fine with closing but till 12 making me have no social life at all.
good,"I'd come in check to see if there were any locks to be fixed then go about my business of inventory reports and customer needs. I learned a great deal from working there like inventory, fixing locks, cutting glass. I was lucky and to of the best managers in the store. That's Zone Manager and Department Manager. The work place environment was of a family. The hardest part of the job was the lifting, a lot of heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing the people and the return customers."
good,I worked in the plumbing department. I helped people with they're plumbing issues. I stocked and cleaned the shelves. I also learned Alot from the customers.
good,No advancement in the company but there are lots of nice people. Not everyone is very nice there is lots of mean customers .............................
good,"Pay was a little low and chances for advancement are there, just very slow to move employees around.  You have to beg to be trained above your position."
good,"This job had the ability to be a great one.Small things make it unlikeable depending on which section you work in. Tool world and hardware was decent but lumber was hard labor. Leaving lumber you will be exhausted, dirty and sometimes injured."
good,"Cleaning and maintaining work area. Help customers find items throughout store. Assist in other areas when needed. broad selection of items to sale."
good,"Used to be a nice place to work, but management rarely focuses on employee wants and needs. The bottom line on a daily basis seems to be more financially based than making their employees happy where they work which to me goes hand in hand with customer satisfaction, which ultimately leads to customers spending more money in a place they like to shop."
good,really enjoyed my summer at lowes was fun interacting with some people not big on being moved around i preferred working outside another over the minimum waged job that had pretty cool perks
good,Was a great place to work but all places have their cons. Every person has their opinion and I would prefer to let anyone interested in working here form their own without bias.
good,"There was plenty of things to complain about but the customers and the employees made up for it. Typical sales Job, plenty of freedom working in a big box store but requires self discipline to get everything done on your own time."
good,The pace was the fastest i had worked anywhere. And everyday was something new. Though there was too much micro management of activities. But over all the it was a fun experience.
good,I enjoyed working at lowes. Got to meet customers and help with all there needs. I really felt like I grew as a person with the responsibility I had working there.
good,"t typical day is dealing with different kinds of people   Ihave learned a lot for the years that i have been there."
good,"LOWES is a great place to work."
good,"Working in the outside garden was fun at first, but got boring really fast. I did enjoy learning about the plants though. It can get really hot and I was basically just watering plants for eight hours."
good,I was a full time college student while working for Lowe's. They provided flexible hours working around my class schedule. I was allotted a reasonable amount of vacation days and received an annual raise each year I work there.
good,"Face pace environment that test your service level. Open door policy. Diverse store. Allow matrix scheduling for Full-time employees. Increase time off the more years employed, scale with calculation is provided."
good,"While the practices and expectations of some of the higher up positions were questionable, the environment and management were professional and safe, good place to work!"
good,I enjoy my position as well as the leadership team.  I am given the autonomy to lead as I see fit.  The environment is always changing and I must adapt rapidly and constantly evolve to remain relevant.
good,Liked working at Lowe's. Wish I could have stayed there longer because I like customer service. Hours were long but have since been changed in the time since I left. As with all retail stores sales are the bottom line.
good,"I have worked with Lowe's for 8 years now. Lowe's is good company to work for. Good benefits,  and they care about their associate and their work environment."
good,Its Good company with team collaberation. I learned a lot of tools in different kind of usage and majorly wrote scripts for automating daily builds and decreased work time for developers.
good,Lowes is good company to work  specially in IT department. Learned a lot and nice workplace culture. Managers are very cooperative with their sub ordinates.
good,"Very one-sided.  If you spoke your mind, or offered feedback, you were looked at as always being combative or insubordinate.  Not really open minded as far as different ways to do things."
good,Clocked in form work at 6 am organized receipts from previous day. help customers with payment and refunds. occasionally place orders or find product for customers.
good,"Great company to work for with tons of benefits and other options, management kinda have there picks like everywhere else but other than that, great employees willing to learn."
good,I only worked at lowes for about three months because it was a temporary summer position but I enjoyed the time that I was there. The management was nice and willing to work things out with you.
good,Lowes was a seasonal job I enjoyed it. I worked in lawn and garden to begin with and then was moved to appliance and helped with delivery. Sales of appliance and working with people was enjoyable also
good,Work would be very busy from the time you walked in until the time you left. This made the time go by very fast. With this job you were able to learn all different aspects of the store if you were willing. This company was a very good company to work for.
good,"Lowes's on a store level can be a good job for anyone. People from the college student looking for. Summer job to someone looking to make a career l, Lowes has something for everyone depending on how hard you are willing to work."
good,"Providing exceptional Customer service while maintaining company budget. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people. However, it is hard to advance within the company."
good,"Good work environment low pay job.and spuratic hours  "
good,Started when store was being built.. Hard work but was able to get a fair bit of exercise. Lots of standing . Tried to transfer to red deer store but they did not hire me as I took approved/ un paid time off.
good,I worked at three different locations my favorites were in NC at the CDT and Ballantyne. They both had great people that were supportive and informative about advancement.  When everyone was on the same page it made the job very easy.
good,"For part-time employees the pay and hours are good. The management isn't the best, but that usually doesn't effect your work schedule. For full timers there is good room for growth and good benefits."
good,Was with the company over 13 years and they provided myself multiple training courses to be successful at positions that I was promoted into throughout my tenure.
good,"Management is click oriented at most stores. Having a bad manager can make a store intolerable, but mine were decent. They laid off a few assistant managers at every store last year which was unsettling. Corporate is somewhat clueless about the day to day activities of the store - they visit occasionally and some of them have clearly never worked in an actual store. Lowe's has been on a cross training fix lately, specifically so they can under staff the stores and have people with little knowledge of the department run the show. A lazy employee can last much longer than they should, especially if they don't call in too much. Free food and barbecue events are nice and the 401K and stock options are great. Benefits are so-so and not as good as they used to be."
good,"There was never a dull moment from day to day. Keeping all of the cashiers and management happy was quite a task. Handling situations with unhappy people is never enjoyable. All in all, most days were busy and profitable."
good,"So far, co-workers are very friendly.  Managers are too many of them per store.  I didn't get use to these too many managers in one place.  I use to have only one manager per a site.."
good,I enjoyed my time with the unload crew that I had to work with but other times there  wasn't enough man power to get the job done in a timely fashion.
good,"Great place to work with many benefits including health and vision, 401k and other programs within organization to promote advancement. Great culture, strong team work values."
good,many years ago i worked here. im sure things have changed.. i cant say i liked my job but i was young and wasn't thinking like a adult. i was not responsible when i was 19
good,"enjoyed job greatly first several years. management is always changing and many bad seeds get thru the cracks. tried to move up, but seemed to be slow"
good,"Lowes is retail so as long as you can handle differing hours, fast pace, sales and merchandising demands, customer demands, etc. it's a great place to work. Pay sometimes is not commiserate with performance or title, but that seems to be all around these days."
good,pay is good starting off but you quickly realize that the pay isn't that great because you're doing various jobs not in the job description. management is on a broad spectrum so some are easy to get along and very friendly and others are the complete opposite. The hardest part of the job is little to no overtime. The easiest part is paid time off and sick days occur frequently.
good,"Worked there as a teenager.  Enjoyed my experience there.  Job could be physical at times, could be mentally frustrating.  worst part about job was angry customers"
good,"i do not wish to answer this question at this time,  It is a okay company to work for. I did not like my management team but i worked for 16 years under many different managers and some where good"
good,"I enjoyed the work I was doing, and appreciated the opportunity despite being less than knowledgeable in my department. Best part of the job were the coworkers who were very knowledgeable and willing to help fellow workers and customers alike."
good,"Good pay, good manager, little room for growth in my area of expertise. Excellent working conditions, great people to work with on daily basis. Nice facilities."
good,Good place to work for retired people and students needing to make money for school. Management is nice to employees. Helps to have some home improvement knowledge.
good,"Each day presents new challenges which must be met and dealt with. Opening the store is different than coming in to close the store. Managing the day requires setting priorities and following through with their accomplishment. For me, this proved to be the greatest challenge. Finding time in the midst of tasks was the hardest part of the job. Meeting and helping people was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I worked in receiving, so my day consisted of me unloading trailers and all that goes with that. We used LRT's to scan product. We had to stack product on pallets, wrap them safely, and move them for the runners using pallet jacks. The hardest part was working the trailers that had the heavy product. We had a good crew and most everyone got along. Our manager was strict but fair."
good,"* Typical day: maintaining cleanliness of the store."
good,Lowe's honestly cares about their employees. I have worked their for four years and they have always inspired me to be not only a good worker but an honest one. They have taught me many skills and I could not be any more pleased with them!
good,Lowes was a fun place to work. Completely out of my field. but I enjoyed it. I love the garden center and met wonderful people. The management had a good team of people.
good,"Lowes was a great place to work. Like any retail chains"
good,"It was ok, there were a lot of good people who worked there. They moved people around alot which was a little hard to adjust to. Overall it was ok I guess,"
good,"this company was very clean and held up with strong management, i was hired as a cashier and they soon taught me most other positions. the owners of lowes push for all mangers to keep their employees just under full time to reduce benefits to all employees."
good,"Initially the atmosphere at Lowe's was great. Eventually like most good things it didn't last. The staff was underpaid and over worked and the managers were condescending, the business it was initially no longer exists. The store is so customer driven that there is no loyalty to the employees whatsoever."
good,For working at a box store this place is fine. Pay at a place like this is low but atmosphere is okay. The people were fine but the job itself is not challenging.
good,"Part time job majority of the day is spent unloading trucks and moving it to the correct area, occasionally there isn't a truck and you just wonder around the store for a few hours helping customers. Management can be a little demanding and nit picky but a good paying part time job."
good,competitive wages and benefits. stressful environment. stock plans available. need to be better with training. people genuinely enjoy each other but sometimes are allowed to do bare minimum in their jobs.
good,A positive experience for several years throughout and immediately after college. The job challenged those who were willing to work and offered chances to learn new things.
good,Its a very skinny margin business. difficult to make a living if your just an hourly employee. Its a great job if you are retired and need to supplement your income.
good,"i enjoyed working at lowes because of the people and my coworkers, work wasnt that stressful but management did put alot of us because we didnt have many workers so the ones we did have did lots of work."
good,It's Lowe's. I checked people out and helped them find products to help with their home improvement projects. Company was fine. Lots of focus on safety.
good,"It is a good place to work for many people. I stayed there while going to school for my undergraduate career. It was good in terms of pay, benefits, and flexibility for a part-time worker especially. The culture at my Lowe's is a bit tedious as it is full of gossips and false people. Management changes consistently so there are definitely managers you can and cannot like and trust."
good,"My favorite part of the job was the customers and our interactions. I had a lot of return customers that helped make my days enjoyable. The down fall to my experience was issue amongst fellow employees and drama in the workplace. I worked as a Head cashier, credit coordinator, stocking crew and appliance associate."
good,"Lowes is a fun place to shop, the employees are dedicated and the customers are great.."
good,"very fast paced environment. a lot of new employees hired on a regular basis , very good work hours chances for advancement throughout the building . pay just isn't enough"
good,Its a nice set up of having to balance cleaning/ stocking duties with customer service because the service part comes at different rates through out the day and the other duties you do at your own rate to be done by the end of your shift or by closing. The duties beyond helping customers would differ a fair bit from day to day. Stocking and such can get repetitive but the work load wasn't usually bad. Break time was easy to work out with coworkers and the people there are nice. You get to feel pretty helpful here usually.
good,Unfortunately the league city location in in need of staff and but on the other hand i am receiving well over 40 hr a week while being a part-time associate.
good,"Good compensation - Guest Commitment - Good Leadership - Committed Store associates - Strong Accountability - Hardest Part - Too Political - Great Training,"
good,"I didn't hold a typical job - I worked out back in Assembly, so I really had it made. Loved what I did and no one really bothered us. No one really showed me how to do anything out in the store - how to run the cash register or any equipment, how to look things up or anything like that. Since I buy so much stuff at Lowe's, anytime a customer would snag me, I pretty much knew where things were, so it was a cool summer job for me. Only real complaint was that there was no real guidance and the only way I found out that I was going to be laid off was that my name didn't appear on the next cycle's work schedule."
good,Working here is good for the most part. The only con is that some management can be poor at time. Otherwise you get at least a 15 minute break if you are part time and they occasionally will celebrate the stores success by bringing in food for the employees to eat while on their break or lunch.
good,Lowes is a great place to work in the retail industry. Lowes provides quality training in order to assist the customer. Customer service definitely comes first.
good,Lowe's is not a bad place to work but it is always room for improvement.  I've been there for three years and some changes have been made for the better and some have not.  Safety is one of the core values.
good,Lowe's is overall a good company to work for. The pay is decent. It's different store to store what management is like. I worked in two locations. The first the manager had to much favoritism. The current location has a better manager but the store is in a difficult location.  Overall I enjoy my job but it's hard to find a good work-life balance in a retail environment.
good,"You take away the later hours...its not a bad place to work, Generally its 40hrs but some departments rotate you early in the morning one day to late at night the next. Could be difficult on young families,"
good,"the environment was a friendly one , just the amount of work i did wasn't worth the pay and my weekends. i did two jobs for the price of one and the managers knew."
good,"Reasonable pay for the job requirements, though you need to advance into management if it is going to be a career choice."
good,"I really liked my job but I'm needing 30 or more hours a week."
good,"Great benefits"
good,"I was told by HR that I would be given full time. The position was given to someone else because she knew the manager. The HR manager at the time did not know how to correctly do his job. Breaks were never given on time."
good,"Great place to work. Love the people and the customers, however they cant seam to figure out where there going or how to get there. They Just follow what ever home Depot is doing except as Etrade said, ""They can not seam to execute their programs very well. The turn over is high partly because you never know when you are working. you need to be available every day from open to close with the exception of students and a few part time positions. You can't take and other job even if you wanted to and still work there."
good,Like any job has good and bad days. They have made to many changes lately  that have not worked in my opinion that has made working there not as good as it use to be
good,Everyone i work with is kind and friendly. Was not afraid to ask questions i did not know. Generally the best days are days we get a flat bed and have freight to put away.
good,"Working at Lowe's was fun at times. Assisting customers was great and enjoyable. The pay, however was low and made it difficult to meet needs."
good,Typically; a day at lower deals with greeting customers when you walk in the door. Sales specialist are responsible for maintaining sales leads and getting new leads from customers that come in or produce leads outside the store through customer satisfactions in store. Specialist must also maintain sales quotas.   From my experience; the departments that I've worked in are quick paced but moderate stress leveled environment.  Most of that is just hitting the sales quotas.  Sales quotas are obtainable. I was rarely able to take a breath bot never board. There is always something that needs to get done.  All in all.  the position is good and stable in the company.
good,The employer takes care of you as far as benefits. They do as much as they can as far as work parties and thanking employees for work done.  It is a typical retail setting. It is very fast paced. There is a lot of different customers that come in and it is neat to see all the different projects that come though the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you for with customers. I have learned a lot about home improvement. There are some amazing people that work at Lowe's.
good,"Meet and interacted with lots of customers and had the opportunity of learn to handle multiple situations, had a supportive management staff and most of the employees seemed to be happy to be at work"
good,You never know what your schedule is going to be week to week. Lot of the employees are not team players. But if you do your job you will have a job and for most part employees' are ok.
good,"An ok place to work."
good,"really fun working there but could sometimes be bad days. Also, they took care of you when you need time off for a family emergency. The company cares for it's people"
good,"Work place is laid back and relaxed. Most seasonal employees leave after Christmas holiday season. Good for part time job seeker, not alot of career advancement available."
good,"Rewarding experience. Sharpens people skills and selling skills. Could use more organization in certain areas, but overall a great company to work for."
good,"Good place to work, easy part or full time work. Good benefits and overall comfortable work environment.As far as a big box retailer I would recommend this location."
good,"Overall good management and great co workers. Pays well but can sometimes be stressful. The benefits are good, and you get 3 breaks and a good amount of time for lunch."
good,"I learned hoe to work and deal with all types of people, cultures, and backgrounds. This job had prepared me for pretty much anything and everything in the workplace."
good,"Lowes the company is a wonderful company to work for, and I do miss working there. Unfortunately  store managers and their politicking has it's downfall."
good,"Nice work environment, variable and flexible hours, fast-paced environment with a high degree of dealing with the public. However potential for growth is slow and you are required to apply for any promotion that is posted,"
good,"The biggest things you have to deal with at Lowes is the people you work with, being whiners and creating unnecessary drama, and policy. you may encounter an easy intelligent way to solve a problem but policy may prohibit you from doing so, often it hurts the store and the customer."
good,"Physically demanding at times depending on department, however overall good place to work. Overtime was not mandatory but a few times it felt like it in the delivery department. I had no issue with it because I enjoyed to work. For some it may not be preferable."
good,Culture indicative of typical retail jobs. Good people and good management. Time with managers was beneficial and they truly care about having a good team.
good,"As with all retail positions, the job has pros and cons. I've enjoyed working here for 10 years, and now I'm ready for a new challenge. The management could use some work, and they could be more supportive, but they do take what you say under consideration. The pay scale they use is questionable sometimes, but I feel personally well paid for the work I do."
good,Was a fairly good job for a start out job right out of high school. The training is extensive and orientation is long and drawn out. Pay was decent and you got raises on time.
good,"As a specialist, you deal with customers more and have a quota each month.  If your organized and know how to work order-management you will be fine.  Your pretty much in charge of making sure installations get done. Almost like a project manage."
good,"As a team member, it is a great place to work and even fun. Much is asked from supervisor and more is added every day. Team members punch in and out but have to perform at least 120%, making there jobs a bit more stressful and in some cases unsafe."
good,Company pays good but is going through restructure so job security is not 100%. Very few positions in the store that pay well. Only specialist and manager make good money.
good,You will be assisting customers in a retail environment.  Assisting teammates in retail environment.  Training and development is very much lacking at Lowe's.
good,"Sometimes I would run the cash register"
good,This Company Had great potential but poor management. I became management so fast because of my involvement in advancing the store that advance very quickly.
good,"you have to be able to manage many different things at the same time and be able to deal with customer concerns, also knowledge of product is very important.."
good,"Stay busy, wait on customers.  The associates were friendly, and customer focused.  Typical day, take product out of top stock and refilling the selling shelves.  Clean department."
good,Work outside regardless of the weather unloading trucks and pulling orders for contractors. Stressful part of the job is waking up at 3am but i enjoy working alone
good,Unloading 5000+ pieces per day for slightly more than minimum wage with no benefits on a strict time schedule was a very stressful and unrewarding position. That said the management was very understanding with our complaints and generally was understanding.
good,I am a cashier and meet and deal with a variety of people and situations.  Working with the public first hand helps you to learn how to handle a variety if different situations..
good,"stressful, some customer are difficult and disrespectful but you have to learn how to deal with those situations. my coworkers are amazing and very helpful."
good,"Its not Lowes Home Improvement it is Lowes foods.  Lowe's Foods is a good company, but the merchandising and Management of the company could use a little improvement.  More employee involvement in making decisions and taking constructive feedback could help the company improve for the employees as well as the consumers who shop there.  Descent family environment to work and the management is easy to work with and the people are great."
good,It depends on what you want from this job. The culture is that of a job. It's a fast pace work place and management does what they can.You have to your best to solve your own problems.
good,any job is what you make it. there is up and downs but overall its a great place to start a career. Do your job to the best of your ability and don't worry about the rest.
good,"heavy lifting, night shift 9pm to 6am, there are several issues with the inventory that do not get addressed. management does not seem to address issues with people not performing."
good,I loved working at Lowe's. The managers and employees were always there to support you if you needed anything. Worked as a team to get the job done. If something would go wrong your team will be right a long next to you to help you fix it.
good,the best place i ever worked i have learned how to handle up front at the customer service desk how to do returns and how to answer the phone manger was always fun are team meetings were always fun but i didnt like waking up at 4:30 to get there for 5 the most enjoyable part about my job was getting to know the regular customers
good,Lowes is a good place to work with good benefits for full time employees.  Not many benefits are offered for part time employees. Pays very well with annual raises
good,"Lowes provided a secure place to work.  When the rest Of the construction industry was going under, Lowes was going strong. Great benefits and very little overtime."
good,Fast paced demanding company depending upon your position held and job you were doing.  Benefits were very good. The culture of the workplace is to serve customers.
good,"Lowe's is a service oriented company that prides on taking care of it's community. Competitive, but behind in technology. I learned a lot about DYI. I liked the planning and working with my team. The hardest part of the job was trying to streamline communication."
good,Good group of people to work with. The staffing at Lowe's is very diverse with individuals from all aspects of life. The diversity of the staff is celebrated which helps to bring everyone together as one team. The hours flex between opening in the mornings and closing at nights. Weekends are a must working retail. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers that appreciate the service and knowledge that we provide.
good,Lowes was filled with different types of people that kept the day alive. I enjoyed most of the day but sometimes customers could be very mean and expect alot from you.
good,Employed over 8 years...recommendation of work performance is great good place to work with flexible hours based on one's availability...provide vacation hours
good,"Depending on the focus of the store manager, the environment of the location can be disconnected or team oriented. The store manager sets the culture of the location and when the management team is put under unnecessary stress it tends to be felt by the store associates. On the opposite side, when the store manager trusts his management staff to run the location, they can positively motivate the employees to work with confidence."
good,"Its a decent work place, customers are nice, you will stay busy so that your workday goes by faster. training is decent and they want new associates succeed."
good,I really liked working for Lowe's the employees were nice and the management actually knew what they were doing. I enjoyed working with the customers and the equipment.
good,"Schedule was not to accommodating to everyday life.Typical day was met with department walks zone(facing) as needed.Pulling orders, addressing customer issues and concerns.Inventory stocking "
good,"On the busy days it gets hectic but other than that it's a cool place to work "
good,Basically the store manager has been very supportive of my work in accordance with company standards.  We are given all the tools to succeed  and see sales growth year to year.
good,Bad opportunities for advancement since it is a who you know promotion process. Otherwise  fun challenging place to work. Good team building and fairly good management at the mid levels
good,Too many constant changes through out the company with no real job advancements. Still like working there just looking for something new that offers advancement.
good,"many changes have brought low morale to store, however i shake off the non sense and make things not such a big deal. certainly makes it easier to go about my day with out much drama, cant say the same for other coworkers though"
good,"Well Organized, Friendly workers, Clean work place. Proper tools provided. Safety minded. Great training .Employee Discounts on company merchandise. friendly people to work with."
good,"A typical day at work as a cashier at Lowes, was a very laid back atmosphere. I would wait for customers and ring up their items. The register was very easy to use. Sometimes I would work in returns, and customer service. What I learned at Lowes, I learned various names for tools and etc. Management at Lowes I can honestly say I rarely ever saw anyone in management. The Hardest part of my job, was standing for long periods of time, we were not allowed to sit unless we were on break. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with all the customers."
good,"I enjoyed my time there. The job was seasonal, but I had no trouble getting time off when needed, and getting hours when i wanted them. I would have stayed on if they had an opening for me."
good,Fast Paced. No overtime. May be asked to take a personal day to help with companys individual dept schedual hours. Part timers must be flexible but personal request are granted.
good,"Benefits, different job opportunities, good atmosphere. Schedule is sometimes difficult. Overall a great place to work. It's the best retail establishment that I've ever worked at."
good,"Great part time work. I enjoy my co workers, and the customers. every employee is focused on helping the customer, and will bend over backwards to help them."
good,Lowes was a great place to work mostly because of the employees. We helped each other as needed and management held events to keep the company up beat.
good,"Lowes is going through a massive company-wide restructure. As a result there is low morale, lots of questions, and few corporate answers. More and more of the work that was done by department managers is being shifted down to lower level employees. So far they have reduced the number of department managers from 12 to 5, outsourced IT, eliminated one ASM and will eventually eliminate two more, have completely outsourced deliveries, reduced HR to one shared employee to two or more stores, are in process of eliminating Loss Prevention and the Installed Sales Office, and it is reported that they will be eliminating all Sales Specialists except for PSI, PSE and ProServices."
good,I worked at the busiest Lowes in the world and loved it when we were crazy busy with lines around the corners.  I worked with great people and loved our customers.  The work schedule was difficult to have a personal life.  I never understood how the store that brought in the most revenue couldn't afford to pay more to the hourly workers.
good,I enjoyed my time at Lowes I worked normal days and got to work with a lot of people.  My job was a new position at the time and there were a lot of growing pains and changes happening.  The management team I worked with were great and almost all of them were supportive.  Hardest part of the job was life balance.  You would get calls depending on whether you were working or not anytime anywhere.  Most enjoyable part was the team atmosphere.
good,It's an ok place to work management is fine if you are their favorite or do everything they want.  As long as you do exactly what they want and do not question anything it's a great place.  Also the pay is better for part time
good,"Is a good place to work for a part time job, but with the recent changes in Tue company it leaves less chances for people to  advance and move up in the company."
good,"I am looking elsewhere for a new career, maybe out from retail, or a minimum retail environment. Lowes is a good company, but their changes in structure do not work for me."
good,"Lowes is a wonderful place for anybody wanting to acquire new skills and work with lots of different personalities. I was able to attain my forklift license while I was here along with other power equipment licenses to enhance my daily routine. Although it was not necessarily a requirement for employment, it does provide you with an opportunity to help out more around the store and assist customers with their shopping experience. Everyone is really friendly and most are very quick to help you with whatever you need. Our goal is to ensure that our customers get the best possible experience so that they come back and shop with us again in the future. Our associates are just as passionate about whatever project you are working as well as you. We take pride in our work and our knowledge that will help you find the best product that will achieve the ultimate result in your vision. Lowes is overwhelming with positive energy and it was a fun atmosphere to work in. I am glad I got a chance to experience it. It definitely helped me in the long run in terms of being able to assist customers and learn more about the retail market in a way I never could before!"
good,"Heavy lifting, very dusty, dirty. Hot in summer cold in the winter. Job is fast pace. Good benefits for area.  Shipping department loads the biggest part of trucks by hand."
good,"3/4 of the store were not trained properly and are expected to do the workload of 3 people while still having to complete their own tasks, and then are questioned and occasionally written up for work not being done. Then ontop of that their is next to no coverage."
good,Dedication and results is the name of the games. There are so many changes going on right now we are all scared of our future with Lowes and where it is going.
good,"A typical day at work would include a variety of things such as helping customers find the product they need, down stocking, helping customers load products in their cars, operating hi-low's, etc. From working at Lowes, I gained customer service skills, and also learned how to operate different types of power equipment. The work environment was very fast-paced, especially in the summer. The hardest part of the job was learning and having to remember information about all of the products in the seasonal section. The most enjoyable part of the job was that employees got an hour lunch break."
good,"The call center environment had great potential. The hours are rotating and the days are long for management.  If you can handle a past pace job in customer service, this is the place"
good,"Not very happy about being made to take this survey, REALLY kind of put off by this, it really makes me not wish to participate in this any further....."
good,I loved working at Lowes they treated their employees really well and if you ever needed time off they were more than happy to give you the time off everyone was so nice
good,"put away truck, downstock product assist customers. help other departments. Train fellow employees on power equipment, have monthly meetings about sales and theft."
good,"Worked in the mornings as a stocker.  I also was a customer service associate, so i assisted customers with any questions they may have had.  I also did special deliveries for items we didn't have in stock."
good,the culture is very interest. the hardest part of the job is putting the leftover items in top stock when working over night. I enjoy driving the power equipment's
good,"Lowe's as a company is great to work for. I recommend it to anyone who wants to be involved in home improvement. Culture is as you would expect in a place with over 150 employees good and bad. Best part of the job is sharing your knowledge with customer and staff, and knowing that you made a difference in someones life."
good,A caring company. They gave chances within the company before they would look elsewhere. The management was very caring about their employees and their families
good,"A lot of fast paced and heavy lifting, customer service is key point but lack of staffing makes it difficult to manage multiple tasks at once. Lack of guidence and leadership makes it a difficult work place to manage yourself in and he higher the management goes the less they know what's happening"
good,Very good place to work pretty much laid. You're not micro managed as long as you do what you're suppose to do. Good benefits and a decent pay. Overall pretty good company.
good,"Fun place to work the people are awesome. Love helping the public"
good,"This was a great stepping stone for me.  I had been a stay at home mother for 10 years. I worked part time and enjoyed it.  At one point they were not willing to work with my child care schedule, therefore I had to leave."
good,This is a great job for a college student. They are flexible with their hours and will work around your school schedule. Overall this is a fun environment to work in.
good,"Working at Lowe's has been a wonderful experience.  I have learned so much, solving problems with customers orders if there are any, helping to train new employees, processing internet orders, signing customers up with the mylowes card to incorporate their military discount."
good,"Lowe's enjoys an accommodating, laid-back culture. However, there has been an ongoing shift to move internal development offshore. If you're a developer, or in IT at large, your future here may be in question."
good,I really my peers I work with and assisting customers. I learned the values of hard work and how to be effective in personnel and the hardest part of the job would be not getting enough hours.
good,Enjoyed working with fellow peers and working to complete store goals. Working in store was a great experience and a good life lesson to the fact you must take time for yourself to train to be successful
good,Pay is decent for this type of position. Schedule is crazy and it is hard on your body.  They have a good benefits package.  Job can be very stressful at times.
good,"fast paced environment"
good,"The store's management Is not always the best, there is definitely room for improvement. The store manager is absolutely dedicated and I admire him to his hard work for his store. The assistant store managers (Around 5 of them I believe) are all hard working, but have to much weight on their shoulders that they cannot take care of the more insignificant workers."
good,Management will delegate work as soon as you walk in. Coworkers will do not help out in your department if you are busy unless told to do so by a manager. Always understaffed on weekends.
good,I enjoyed my time spent at Lowe's. If you enjoy helping customers and the retail environment this may be the place for you. Compensation is comparable with others in the industry.
good,"My day is always a little different. We have many different customers. I always try to understand each person's needs or concerns. I sometimes work at the Customer Service Desk. I take returns, and refund the customers. I answer questions, direct, or take customers to the items they are looking for."
good,Lowes has very poor training and can be hard to get a handle on at first but the jobs is overall easy. Pay is decent for the amount of worked asked. ---
good,I really loved the company I just wasnt making enough money due to the cut hours. The management was decent and the coworkers were awesome. It was always really fun and an enjoyable day. If I had the opportunity I would go back.
good,"weekend associate. Management is not very great at times."
good,"Management has got a lot to learn about what their people can and cannot do. there is nothing more to say, but this things says I have to get to a certain number of words."
good,"It's a great place to work if you can stand on your feet for 8-9 hours and handle a few difficult customers now and then. "
good,Lowes is a great company to work for. And other employees are helpful. The hardest part of the job would be that you are on a time limit to unload trucks.
good,"Enjoyed working for this company for the most part. Get to meet lots of new people and learn a lot. "
good,"Good environment and great employees"
good,"A good adventure helping people turn ideas into happening projects. Using past experiences to help in home repair, home additions, and new projects was fun. Building relationships with customers was like a small town positive environment and made going into Lowe's each day very much an adventure.  The varying schedules from very early in the morning or late at night made family life stressful, not having a  set schedule made planning family time impossible.That was the bad part of being employed at Lowe's,"
good,"I love working for lowes, but management could use some improvements to make working there the ultimate experience. Overall, it's a great starting job and there's a lot of benefits that come with the job."
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work. The pay is decent, they were willing to work with my schedule, and treated me like a human being. I would not recommend Lowe's as a career, but for the short term they are a good option."
good,"rotating schedules and long hours. not a good home to work balance. Pay is competitive. fast pace atmosphere, and depending on manager it can be intense goals."
good,"Like I said great pay and time off in your first year, but a typical call center environment. Managers didn't even know how to help us when we had a problem just sat at a table with their laptops all day and eating food. Culture was great and family oriented."
good,"Was a nice place to work. Management was always willing to work with you.  Worked late nights, which is a down fall if you are working more then one job."
good,"part time you dont make enough, alot of work for little pay. management is very easy to work with and they usually are easy going people that under stand short comings"
good,Lowes has shifted it's business model in the last few years. While following current trends they no longer put the value on retaining quality people they once did. They are still a good company just not of the caliber they once were.
good,"I enjoy working with different people. Sometimes management slips up, but they say they seem to care . I would recommend it to a friend. and the pay is better than minimum wage."
good,"Great culture of putting customer first, however lack of training and a small daily work force allowed you to real help the customer in detail.  Management was always great, and there was nothing really hard about the job. All in all easy work."
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work. The store manager is great and always has a good attitude when on the job. He makes sure that his customers are taken care of. However, the lower parts of management could use some improvement with their attitudes towards some of the employees. I feel since it is mostly women that work in the front as cashiers there is always some sort or drama. Overall its a great place to work and the pay if good."
good,If you work hard and long enough at lowes you will be rewarded with a promotion or two. i had some great managers and had some really bad managers but it was an overall good experience.
good,This a great place to start a career. They train you in all departments of store. If it wasn't for the distance i would still been there today. Wages wasn't bad at time either.
good,"On a daily basis in the garden center responsible for answering all customers inquires and suggesting appropriate products. Plant watering, arrangement, intake, and pruning were also daily tasks."
good,Lowes was a a nice place to work. The environment was productive and very organized within company. Fast paced work place that required and full effort on a daily basis.
good,One of the better companies to work for in retail. Benefits are great and the bonuses are even better when the store works together to achieve these goals.
good,"I think Lowes is a great place for young people to start a working experience for the training, to learn how to work with the public, to learn how to work in general, get used to being punctual and to show respect to your leaders and the public. If there is a good management team you can go far."
good,"Lowes was my first full time job. It taught me how to run a register very well and how to assist customers.  During my time there, I met some very nice employees, and some not so nice. However, they treated employees very well; ex) picnics, prizes for most products sold, etc."
good,Love the job and my co-workers.  Only issues is that upper management doesn't care about helping out.  They won't help with customer relations.  Have weird hour scheduling.  Very rarely have a full weekend off unless its requested in advance.
good,"Typical work days there weren't to bad as far as the job goes. Management sucks, Lowe's cares more about pleasing its stock holders than their own employees and customers and their ease of access to a pleasant shopping experience come after profits do."
good,Corporately competitive. Strong work ethic environment. Fair benefit package with tenured positions locked into advancement opportunities. Culturally stable.
good,had a lot of fun working with the crew in lawn and garden. its retail so it doesnt pay much but got to learn alot of new things. also was nice to help customers out
good,"Very stressful work environment; management attempts to help the best they can, but there is never enough employees working to attend to the high volume of customers."
good,"its a very high pace retail chain, growing fast. and very right attitude to grow there people. sometimes promote early and then end up spending a lot of time paying them the higher position wages during training them for the current job"
good,"Finding solutions for customers. Lot's of down stocking product."
good,"everyone is entirely replaceable, and it can be quite disheartening to see your employer readily say goodbye to hardworking people. recently my store let go of two managers with 20+ years of experience only to immediately place a now hiring sign out front to hire cheaper, seasonal employees."
good,"good summer job for kids in college. if you are looking for some easy money, this isn't a bad spot. the schedule isn't  friendly because it is not a set schedule."
good,"Overall,  it was a good place to work but I was not happy with the micro management.  As a department manager,  I didn't feel like I was given the freedom to run my dept as I would have liked because upper management seemed to have a hand  in everything I did in regards to running my department."
good,Working at Lowes was a very great experience.I get along very well with my peers and head cashiers even with my managers..The environment is very pleasant.
good,"Excelent Place"
good,"I never had a problem with any of the workers, the hours were always what I needed them to be, and if I ever needed any more hours that what I was scheduled, the managers were more than happy to call me in when someone called out. Company is phenomenal, they try to help their employees out as much as they can"
good,Being at Lowes was such a great experience you would not only learn the ins and outs of your day to day job but also the ability to adapt to be able to give outstanding customer service to any age group at any given time. Being able to work with the public is hard as it is. By having a strong group of individuals that work there make it that much more fun.
good,"Improving Culture growing, Customer Centric"
good,"Escorting customers around the store to locate wanted items, replenishing stock, straighten shelves, returning goods to proper location were common chores. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers about their projects and solutions.The most difficult part was keeping up with inventory that was spread throughout the store."
good,"They gave me the option of working more hours if so desired. "
good,"very poor management and advancement opportunities.  always under-staffed but fellow employees are mostly some of the nicest people in the world.  "
good,Lowe's is a good company for someone that does not have a family life. The best part about working there were the people. Working for a major cooperation can be difficult
good,"It was not an easy job. There were many responsibilities that came with it . It was an overall great work environment. They are very big on safety, so big that every day they stop the workers for at least 10 minutes to discuss safety."
good,"Unfortunately given the recent changes with restructuring the culture of my particular store is now a harsh one. People are leaving resulting in next to no support staff in a multi million dollar location. People are ignoring you when you need help, leaving you to cover 3 -  5 different departments at any given time by yourself. It wasn't always like this though, people cared about one another and enjoyed working together. Things have changed from a culture you can embrace and grow from to a culture that you feel stifled and wounded in. With enough staff though the store can become what it once was, which is a company that supports its employees and allows you to learn and grow."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Lowes but did find problems with the Cashier Manager. She was very difficult to work with. Otherwise I really enjoyed my time at Lowes. Bonuses were great and Human resources were also helpful.
good,"Scheduling is ridiculous sometimes. It rotates so it's hard to feel settled. You really can learn so much with a learning spirit. Some stores have higher foot traffic so you may never have a break from people which can be very draining. Some store have low volume so it just depends on location. If your considering a particular store I recommend go at a busy time like Saturday and watch how busy and how many employees seem to be available. That should really provide good insight. Although it may be hard keeping a good attitude it will really stage your day. Unfortunately, many complain. I have worked with all types of associates throughout the years and it really is your choice on how you feel. This company is great to maintain a good working relationship with incase you need a quick transitional job. They seem to always be accommodating if that relationship has been built. I know many employees who left then came back."
good,"Interesting clients and a wide variety of situations to assist customers with. With so many departments, working at Customer Service means you get the full view of what goes on in the store, and there's always something to do."
good,Worked here for only about a week. Honestly doesn't deserve to be on my resume but pretty productive place. Everyday is the same. Weekends are actually lighter than weekdays.
good,"Nice place to work with alot of customer and associate interaction."
good,"As the face of retail is shifting to online shopping, Lowe's is focusing on transition to meet customer needs. The corporate workplace culture varies greatly by department and management. Historically learning and upward growth have been available, though the current down-sizing has suspended those opportunities. I believe the future of Lowe's is strong and still recommend it as a wonderful place to work."
good,"Very exciting place to work since one learn a lot about building and redecorating or building from the beginning. A sense of decorating and the unusual items that can be found at the store."
good,"The management team are great to work for and try their best to work with employees. Recently the company has made many changes and while our managers have tried to explain this, I'm not sure everyone understands the reasons for the decisions."
good,"I was with Lowe's for ten years when I got laid off due to a management restructuring.  The company does treat its employees well.  Pay is competitive with other retailers.  The benefits are decent.  The vision plan is quite good."
good,Great People to work with!  I think that the Health Benefits need to be better for both Part time and Full time. Management don't always have it together.  The most enjoyable part is helping people with their plans to create something new in their homes!  The hardest part is not having health insurance worth anything.
good,The company strives for a family type work environment. They have just restructured their staffing model and adjusted their focus to employee development.
good,Lowe's is a good place to work.  They provide good compensation and work/life balance.  They have on-site cafeterias.  Dress code is relaxed.  Stable company.
good,"Solid place to work for. Every culture is different from store to store. They pay well if you are retired, in need of a second job, or a student due to the flexible school schedule."
good,It is great to be part of an energetic well trained team. To be part of a purpose driven company and to connect with all types of customers. It was wonderful to see their dreams becomes reality in their homes and lives.
good,"Overall, I enjoy working for Lowe's Millwork. Most of the managers are enthusiastic, and want to do what is best for their teams. I feel proud of the work I do on a daily basis. The various departments' teams work well together. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement if desired."
good,"Good & friendly company to work for. The pay is OK. Nice Performance-Bonus program. Great & fair attendance policy. Opportunity for department cross training. Can work with minimum supervision."
good,I was a Cashier at Lowe's and helped finish up with customers. They would pay me for the goods they bought and they would be on their way. The job taught me a decent deal about customer service and handling of money both of which I like to do in a professional manner today.
good,"Good place until Management switched around "
good,Very friendly coworkers.  Some unfairness for part-time employees.  Work schedules are not consistent.  Customers are wonderful.  Recognized for a job well done.
good,"Although I have been with Lowes for five years as department manager, I have been disappointed with their opportunities for advancement. I was hired on February 16,2012 and quickly advanced to management in which I was responsible for several departments. Although I enjoy the challenge of advancement,my career has stalled due to corporate changes and reduction of their work force. However the changes, I have enjoyed my tenure there. I am confident that once these coroporate changes settle in, I will be able to continue my career path."
good,not a bad place to work but management has their favorites and it seems like no matter what you do when trying to move ahead that you never get picked they are have it choosen.
good,"Prices seem to be higher,service is in my estimate a little more professional although again with the sales of too many foreign products depriving American workers of jobs."
good,Lowe's is a fine organization to work for. They provide many opportunities for employees to acquire new skills and enhance their customer interaction confidence. The only downside of my experience working for Lowe's is there isn't a solid sense of job security. Financial stability is critical for a person to provide for their families and future employment uncertainties were somewhat stressful.
good,"Lowe's offers different work schedules both full and part time. Days, nights,  and weekends. Pay is average  for first few years. Has different schedules during busy season when they have overtime."
good,"Overall positive place to work, people were great, staffing needs to be improved. Training was stringent but too much put on the Building Materials department as a whole. Not  staffed correctly for customer needs especially in the Building materials department."
good,"is fun but like most corporations you will have frustrations because corporations never seem to make any sense in how they do things."
good,I worked with many different people in different positions. It was a crazy place o be but also good. I at one point was running a whole Dept on my own without a DM or help.
good,Supervisors and higher up employees play a lot of favoritism within the store that I was employed at. They did however try to work with my availability and for the most part was a great place to work.
good,"A typical day of work as a delivery driver for Lowe's consists of hard demanding work in the delivery of appliances, and other products to customers homes or businesses. The hours can vary on a day to day basis which can interfere with ones personal life. My co-workers and I are like family and work together as a team very well. My most enjoyable part of the job is being able to provide excellent customer service to our customers as well as resolve any issues that may arise upon delivery."
good,"Good company to work for. They treat you well as an employee. Opportunity for advancement, unless restructure happens. Good with benefits to there employees when it comes to what they offer. You work close with customers everyday."
good,"Hard work, compensation was alright but could have been better.  Some management was alright and actually cared about people.  Several managers punished employees for being good at their job by never promoting when they should have.  Also by keeping a warehouse employee doing a managers/leads job and not having the new lead/manager to the job themselves."
good,More competitive pay than most retailers. Room for advancement into other departments. Very relaxed dress code. If you plan on working here I strongly suggest downloading the Lowe's app to find item locations
good,"Un día típico en el trabajo, es llegar y empezar a atender correos enviados por los proveedores proporcionándoles la información que necesiten en cuanto sus estados de cuenta y pagos,  también contestar las llamadas telefónicas, elaborar las propuestas para los pagos a realizarse."
good,"It's been a while since I've worked there, sometimes things were fast and speedy and other times were very slow. It could get very stressful there and sometimes the atmosphere smelt of it."
good,"Pretty easy job. Get along well with managers and you'll be alright. Job teaches you a lot about patience. If you don't have patience, don't work in retail."
good,A typical day at work involves assisting customers with their home improvement needs and helping them to love where they live! I enjoy my work for the most part.
good,Advancement may not be possible depending on available positions. Great place to help people with projects and get ideas yourself.   They are good about working with you on hours.
good,good work place and great first time job for someone looking for a place to learn the retail environment. Great pay and you learn alot of needed things in the retail side of work
good,"Definitely exciting helping customers find the right paint for interior or exterior projects, from crafts to room makeovers. The management will always be supportive and kind. I've learned so many things about products and services here that are available to customers. The most enjoyable part is seeing a happy customer."
good,I enjoyed my 7 years of employment with Lowes working with a great team spirit and a variety of people.  The culture at Lowes was outstanding and beneficial to all.
good,We were like a family in the Lawn and Garden department.  I learned so much about plants that I never knew about. I had a great assistant manager that was a great teacher.
good,I would start the day reading all invoices that needed to be loaded onto the trucks. Then i would have to find all the items in the warehouse that needed loaded. Then I would load the trucks. After that we would start the deliveries.
good,"My favorite place to work!  The people were amazing to work with, the customers were even better.  I enjoyed going to work every day when I worked here."
good,"The company itself is an excellent place to work and develop personal skills that one may be able to use in the future, basic home maintenance.  Health and work benefits are really competitive to some of the other benefits from previous work experiences but it is the lack of advancement that hurts the company."
good,"Some managers had their favorites, so no matter how hard you work, their favorites get promotions first.. And there's way to many. Managers and all trying to micro manage. Way to many responsibilities to finish at times, but would I work there again? Probably.. I loved it."
good,"My experience at Lowes store 1200 was a very satisfying. The employees are friendly and kind. Management on the other hand, although friendly, would not or could not schedule enough staff to properly run the store efficiently."
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work, however, there are a lot of issues.  Management needs a lot of work.  The managers were not trained on how to do the Coordinator's job, so there is a real disconnect.  Micro-management is extremely prevalent."
good,Lowe's is and ok company to work for the pay is ok . the moral is very low in the company. the employees complain to much. over all the company is good for like somebody that is going to school.
good,"Lowe's Market is a very easy company to get comfortable with and call home. I would definitely recommend the company to anyone looking for a first job, but it definitely isn't a company to build a career around, due to the low pay rate."
good,"Get to work, clock in go to the break room to get my vest. ( you are not allowed to take vest home) find the head cashier and see if she wants you in the lumber department, outside lawn and garden, returns, or at customer service."
good,Decent place to work. However slow advancement process. It's just like being at high school if you're not part of the cool kids club you won't advance far without a lot of hard work and perseverance.
good,"Lowe's was a great first job, it provided me with experience on a sales floor and also showed me how to properly display great customer service."
good,"good and positive atmosphere to work, good campus and resources. I Utilized my expertise in Information Technology to fill an important Mobility role and to be part of a positive atmosphere that pushes the current boundaries of Mobile."
good,"Started my position as a cashier in september 2015 and finishing around march 2016, worked as a cashier, customer service rep. My job would mostly involve cashing customers out, also cleaning up and loading furniture."
good,This company was great. They paid an honest wage for you work. The management as well as most of the fellow employees were always friendly and helpful. I would still be with the company if it weren't for the price of the health Insurance. That was very expensive.
good,Great job as long as you know what you're talking about. You're in charge when you're on the floor and inventory is done every week and everyone in the department is responsible.
good,Learned great home improvement techniques. Co-workers are friendly but lack team work ethics. Great pay and enjoy helping customers find what they need is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,Great Company with very competitive pay rates.  They are very helpful and accommodating to their employees.  I have enjoyed working there.
good,I wasn't fond of the staff that I worked with or the hours I was given (they will give you the 11 pm closing shifts regularly if you don't say anything even though it's supposed to be rotating shifts). HR is great as is the store manager and assistant managers for the most part.
good,"Always had call outs, made the job harder. Had great pay, good and bad managers just like anywhere.Had great co-workers, were like family."
good,"The thing that stands out the most to me about this job were the people. It was the best work environment I've been in so far. I met some really funny, quality people as my co-workers turned into a quasi-family culture that really left an impression on me. BUT i can't give it 5 stars cuz the management was so subpar."
good,"In the beginning you have to realize this is a family that work as a team and are very hard workers.  "
good,"Working at Lowes has been fun. Good management and staff. Hardest part is balancing my personal, school and work schedule. Enjoyed interacting with the customers and see them smile, because  I gave them great customer service."
good,"The hardest part of the job was learning the different types of wood, bricks, light bulbs and curtains. I really didn't like the type of work there it didn't interest me."
good,"Good place to work "
good,"Organize and inventory count tools merchandise,sales,customer service"
good,You will definitely stay busy all the time. There are many types of customers to deal with. Be patient and respectful and do a good job you will get acknowledged for sure.
good,I love working there back then cause my DAD had it and then later on He ReTire Us but then when the other man took over after he sopose to keep me but he didnt and i love staying there but i couldnt stay and until the other man took over i wish i had to ask back cause i been there since we had it i been there about at least 30 years
good,"The good.  The job was a simple sells position stock inventory, sell the product, mix paint, and give simple home maintenance advice. the benefits are good and you get quarterly bonuses when sells are good."
good,"No super highs, no super lows. Retail is it own thing. You can either choose to enjoy it or not; Customer interaction, Management styles, Always having something to do, Not a whole lot of time to plan, and conflicting orders. In all the retail experiences I have had the record never changes; Be oblivious and fall in line, Be power hungry and do all you can to get ahead, Be thoughtful and get shot down most of the time, or Be passive aggressive and try to please and hate everyone. It is difficult in retail to find a place you can just Be."
good,"Clock in and get your day started normally do some freight and help customers love where they live! I learned how to have great time management, train people effectively, work hard to reach my goals.The hardest part of my job is the daily schedule changing, on day you close and the next day you are in there opening. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping all the customers!"
good,We work none stop from 6am till we punch out.. could be 3pm or could be 5pm.  I drive up to 200 plus miles a day.  The management only cares about getting us out the door. Only recently have they been getting other departments to stage for us.
good,"Because i'm only part time I feel that I can't answer. As  part time employee, Lowes works well with me. Lowes is a good place to work"
good,"Overall experience was great, besides being night shift other then that the work wasn't it to heavy on you and you were able to work at your own paste."
good,"When I come to work at Lowes I set up on my register and assist the customers at checking out at the register. Some products I type item number into to try to get through customers quicker. I also assist some customers in finding things in the aisle that they are looking for. As I check them out , I encourage tem to have a good day and thank them for shopping at Lowes."
good,"Started out as a side gig,  but I really like it at Lowe's. Everyone is helpful.... The customers are pretty cool. You remember most of them."
good,"I work several wonderful people. We all look out for each other, and help each other out. We are a team there. I love working as a team member, and helping others. I work in appliances, as the manager, so I enjoy helping people find their dream kitchens. Helping people is in my blood. It gets tricky sometimes, hen orders do not come in as planned, or a delivery goes wrong. I do what is best for the customer and the company to get them taken care of."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal warehouse person and was moved to delivery out of their necessity. I was asked to give my MVR and license, drug tested but due to miscommunication between my healthcare provider and human resources, a full time position as a driver was given to someone else recently hired. I get a different story from my direct manager, department head, and human resources about the decision but my work was still rated high."
good,Enjoy working there. Learned more about teamwork from my supervisor. Management could use a little help on communcating things to one another
good,I learned about fix things at home that making things come together when you put your mind into fixing a project. It was a great experience.
good,"I was hired after I retired from my 35 year job as a part time permanent floater. I heard they had a great new training program . I really wanted it to work I like Lowes . Although I thought I would have insurance so I could drop the one I pay for but it was not good enough to drop the other. Full timers I heard would have been good enough. I was not trained in anything, I did videos on security and theft the HR was too busy to train me , she sent me home 2 days cause she was busy I had no department to work in . Finally Friday she stuck me in paint without knowing anything at all . It was packed people coming in to get their weekend project materials I was front and center with no training on decks and mixing paint and also cutting blinds to fit windows. I really wanted to make it work I wanted to work in Lawn and Garden and I also have a CDL and knew they were short drivers. I tried to talk to HR and tell her I am not comfortable in paint she said that's where we need help I lasted 5 days total . I am a good worker but I felt stupid not knowing the answers ."
good,Great place to work. Great people friendly environment. The biggest issue is the hours even to part time and seasonal workers.
good,the place is really old and so is the equipment there. a lot of things need to be updated but seems like they only used the money for fixing up the offices.
good,"Lowe's was a great company to work for. Many people simply cant adjust to the fast paced environment but for the self driven, Lowe's turned into an amazing opportunity for me"
good,"Greeted customers"
good,Most of my days are spent assisting customers. I learned how to provide excellent customer service and how to resolve issues the customers have. My co-workers and management were always friendly and willing to help and provide guidance when needed. The hardest part of this job is not having a set schedule and not being able to spend much time with my family.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with and the customers that stop by to get what they need. The pace is fast and enjoy it. This company has worked with my school schedule, which allowed me to finish school."
good,"I learned everything I know about cabinetry and sales from Lowes. I met great friends during my long stay there, but saw the company switch gears on what they really cared about. Less care for the employees and more about bottom dollar only. Great benefits compared to most companies."
good,"I get a big smile on my face when I have a customer come in and ask for me personally. That means I helped that customer before and was successful in fulfilling their shopping experience with us.With me being an avid gardener, it helps when customers come in looking for a particular plant and I am able to help them with ideas on how and where to plant."
good,Very good pay for inexperienced workers however grossly understaffed and was required to work in departments I had little to no knowledge of.
good,Lowe's is a good company to start a career with.  They allow advancement within the company with opportunities to relocate.  With different store sizes the work days can vary from fast pace to slower pace that allows more tasks to be completed.  This is a place that you get the opportunities to meet and work with good people and build working relationships with and learn from those who have been in your position before you.
good,"Lowe's was a very fun place to work. However, advancement was virtually impossible. Had to know someone in upper management to really advance past cashier..."
good,"Scheduled work hours are varied. On any day you might be days, afternoons or evening, nothing constant. Hard to balance personal time, doctor appointments, etc. with schedule,"
good,This company is a sales driven environment. Especially because managements bonuses depended on it. If you have a good management team and are located at a high sales store things will be ok.
good,"I loved the people I worked with! They were fun and energetic, making working there very enjoyable. I felt a little sideswiped by the quotas and reviews of my work at the end as the issues were never brought before then. I would have loved staying there while continuing my college education."
good,This job has been definitely been a interesting one to behold. I enjoy making sure my customers are taken care of. My co workers are productive and social which are key opponents to a successful business. I would say management is definitely great from the communication skills they use.
good,I enjoyed most of my days at Lowe's. The people were very easy to get along with. But with all the change in such a short period in time the people were frustrated with upper management. I got let go when I was on stress leave which was not proper.
good,Ive learned many different skills in my management experience in retail whether it be with the customer or fellow employees.  Communication and time management being the most important. Also learning from loss prevention experience to be able to identify and understand different human behaviors.  My job is physically demanding and there is no issue with that.  I love my job and the people that are part of my team and being able to help customers get the results they need to when piecing together a project.  Hardest part about my job is that the schedule is all over the place leaving little time to plan and function in a family setting in my personal life.
good,I loved working here the only downfall was an unqualified store manager. They had great employees just poor management.
good,"greet customers"
good,As a cashier our time was spent in service of our customers. We always had a smile and drive to help. The hardest part of my day was at the end of shift waiting for my replacement who was often late and I often worked 30 to 40 minutes past my end of shift. I enjoyed my coworkers and regular shoppers very much and looked forward to seeing them. I respected and worked closely with my immediate supervisors.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's can be busy depending on what day it is. I assist customers in my desired department on the different products we have and must be knowledgeable about each product in case customers have questions. I learned how to be patient with customers because not all customers are the same some know what they want before coming into the store and some I have to explain in detail about each product which could take up to 45 minutes before the customer makes a decision. In that 45 minute time period assisting a customer, there may be a customer or two waiting for me to finish with that one customer, since I'm the only one in the department. Management will not come and help most of the time they'll just same call a co-worker over to help you which can get frustrating. The co-workers at my job are friendly and some I've became close friends with. I haven't had any trouble out of any co-worker or manager and they haven't had any trouble out of me. The hardest part of my job is must be able to multi-task. I f a co-worker call out sick or for any other reason I must be able to handle two departments alone. Depending on how busy it is in the store several customers may not get the assists they need due to me being held up by one customer with so many questions. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to co-workers seeing how their day has been and also talking to friendly customers."
good,"Todos son muy amables, tienen una excelente actitud de servicio puesto que es una compañia dedicada a la venta de sus artículos en  distintas áreas"
good,"Unloaded/stocked RDC shipments. Learned much about house appliances, building supplies, as well as many other products sold."
good,As a college student the work hours between school and their hours was overwritten they would not work with my class schedule at the CSUP.
good,"learned how to drive a forklift, reach lift, and order picker. learned a lot about contractors and how they work. learned a lot about flooring, paint, and plumbing. I learned how to install a lot of products. taught me how to put a house together."
good,"Great place to learn about how to fix, improve, or build a home."
good,"I was able to further develop and hone my customer service skills and, of course, learn about DIY home improvement and with that pass that knowledge onto the customers that were planning projects of their own."
good,"The environment is one in which routine is imperative."
good,"Overall a good environment to be employed at. The Coworkers are friendly and will help you when you need it. Management is good. Hardest part of the job is when there is hardly any customers in the store, you don't have anything else to do and your are just standing around doing nothing."
good,"working conditions started off with misconception, I was promised a dept management position and left with asst mgmt, I was teaching the product lines of the seasonal and outdoor dept, I knew the [roducts better than the reps that came by... But my learning continued and I had two years of botony courses which left me with full knowledge of the plants we sold ..."
good,Job was alright. Typical day at work would be team members working at a steady paste. Management was helpful and alright to get along with. Co-workers were good to get along with and friendly. The hardest part of the job was getting up early in the a.m. The most enjoyable part was getting along and working with team members.
good,If you're part time your schedule is all over the place. Really good with giving you requested time off and also good pay.
good,its amazing to work with the people and make people jobs easier when we all work together to get the product from the warehouse to the customers home and to provide them with the customer service they all deserve
good,"A big company comes with great benefits, but it also creates a need for rules to be followed - by everyone... with little regard to your earned respect and loyalty to the company.   Hours not flexible. Everyone has to work every shift.  Poor job training."
good,"Delivering merchandise to customers and assisting with assembly and connection of appliances. Loading and unloading trucks, completing all delivery paperwork and making reminder and follow-up calls to customers."
good,"handled monies, customer services skills were used daily with individuals , payouts were received on daily basis, great communication skills were highly recommended"
good,I work mornings and nights. When i work mornings i come in and cook breakfast burritos and rotisserie chicken. I also cook the other meats they give me. Then i work on making the counters look good or i help wrap meat in the back and weigh up products. I have arthritis so i would say the hardest part of my job would be lifting and working in the cold. I do get along with all my coworkers but i like to work alone most of the time and i get allot done.
good,"The company is a good company to work for with many opportunities. You get to meet and work with many different individuals from a large variety of backgrounds and different work experiences. Much more of a customer service type of position but if willing, an individual can learn many things from the peers and from the customers that they work with daily."
good,Great company for receiving training and support as you grow in your career. Must be able to work peak times and hours. This is retail and you will work long hours and holidays.
good,"Overall, this is a good place to work. The hours arent bad, the people are intertesting and you get to meet peoples from all walks of life. If home improvement interest you or you just enjoy helping people this is a good place."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the everyday interactions with new and old customers that remember you from your excellent service and leadership.
good,"Retail is never an easy place to work, but Lowes made it easy to stay and start or continue a career.  I would have never imagined they had as much to offer as they did."
good,Customer service focused company. Really promote grooming associates to move up in the company. Their employee sharing program is great.
good,"I personally liked working at Lowe's. It was a great place to be, and paid well for Retail. You could have lots of fun. Had Monthly Celebrations. If the store did well, you had some little side games and cook outs. You can move up or to different departments pretty easy. "
good,"Certain managers are more fun to work with than others, however the team as a whole was fun and great to work with. Some days were more stressful and busy than others but it made the time go by fast. The company wanted you to ask the customers too many questions when they were being assisted, and I feel like it became more of a hassle and inconvenience for them instead of helpful."
good,Good working environment with helpful staff.  We all work as a team to make sure the customers experience with us is a positive experience. I need a job that officer more hours.
good,"I worked in the Real Estate Department. The company had an enjoyable work culture but it was very difficult for me to advance within the organizational structure or Real Estate (despite having an growing department) because I was a field located employee, and not getting face time at the corporate office made advancement impossible.In 10years, I was not promoted once, nor was I given opportunities to advance despite having applied for many other positions and having proved my worth many times during my tenure. It felt like an old boys club, and I clearly was not one of the old boys."
good,"great place to work at if you like costumer service,learned allot from other employees and costumers overall  good place to work at."
good,"Overall it's a good place to work. They do a lot for the community and fundraising for charity. Their benefits package on a scale of 1-10 ranks at 6.5 in my humble opinion. The company culture promotes a team effort. However, there are those employees that skate through their day whenever possible."
good,Its a decent part time job for a college student. Sometimes protocol is not followed properly. I work behind the customer service desk I enjoy working with my team.
good,"A good employer to learn new skill sets, hone existing skill sets and refine attention to detail skills. The variety of request and skill needed within a single shift allows a person to become flexible as well as gain knowledge in the various departments. Customer service provided a reward that a paycheck could not match."
good,"Once one gets into a certain department, the job is pretty much the same each day. Middle management is very much into micromanaging. Safety is everyone's goal. Labor hours especially towards year's end become a concern and if there is a vacancy in several positions management expects everyone who is left to absorb the responsibilities of those departments. It spreads each employee thin due to added responsibility without fair compensation or consistent communication. Customer service, cleanliness of store, completing daily tasks, all fall  by the wayside with no attention or acknowledgement given by management. Lunch is an hour (preferably), and they are flexible when it comes to hours, though an open availability is expected for full time employment."
good,Working for the company has been rewarding. My team is awesome and I have enjoyed learning new things. My only con is the holidays and vacation time does not not appear to be competitive.
good,"To provide customer service. To insure all sales in the Flooring"
good,"Typical day at work is simple manual labor, gives me time to take my mind off engineering duties in school. Unload a truck of freight and stage product throughout the store"
good,good job for corporate america (yuck) pay is better than most. sales culture can vary store to store. outdated systems make it very difficult to do my job.
good,A Good Place To Work but the hours could be a little more consistent but overall I would say its a good company. The benefits are decent I haven't had a bad experience.
good,"A great place to work that keeps you busy and helps build customer relationships. Help build character and verbal skills, but most important is that you work as a team to get the job done"
good,"My typical day at work would begin with me walking outside Lawn and Garden department, looking to see what produces needed to be restocked. My co-workers and I worked as a team to keep up the department, making sure that customers shop in a clean safe department."
good,Hours are always available. The pay is good as well. Getting a management position is relatively easier if you do everything that is required of you.
good,We are very under staffed at Lowes. I have learned to manage different cashiers and delegate daily tasks. I love working with the public I am a people person.
good,Good place to work. Other cashiers were very friendly like family. Hours were not as good as could be.Too few hours. Management not very present.
good,An enjoyable and ever changing position with some hard labor and a wonderful amount of interaction with customers providing a fun challenge of figuring out how to  meet the customers needs best. Exiting and fast paced with enjoyable coworkers and a friendly management staff.
good,"The company takes care of their employees and are willing to work with them. Management varies, I have had some very strong upper management, I have also had some very weak members of management. I suppose it varies just like anywhere. "
good,"Typical day ranged from down stocking product to fill shelves, calling customers to ensure they both received their product and enjoy it. I could spend one day in a different department if mine was not busy, or I could spend the day in my department accomplishing my sales goals. "
good,"I did not mind this job just did not quite pay all my bills, so i voluntarily quit leaving on i feel good terms. if i could i would probably get hired back only with a little more compensation."
good,it was a good job had great benefits a peaceful work enviorment had very helpful co workers and mangers that were always understanding and help with any work trouble
good,"Fun place to work, as long as you are outgoing and don't need lots of training, that is where they are lacking.  Training is there but don't give time off floor for you to train to better yourself"
good,Walmart don't really change its the same stuff at every location. The usual lazy managers and co workers when I worked there I got paid 7.65 I'm pretty sure its gone up since then but nothing really special about this employer
good,Great part time job during school.  People were friendly and helpful.  Management was fair and understanding.  Moral was high with everyone.
good,"As can be expected with any retail chain, the schedule is the biggest gripe.  The training provided and benefits available make this pleasant company to work for."
good,Fast pace work environment. Solid department managers who communicates great among each other. Not enough room for growth since corporate restructure. Overall a good company to work for.
good,It is a great place to work at and my coworkers made it an even better place to be at. Management needs to be more flexible when there isn't enough coverage due to THEIR scheduling.
good,it was always a new day going into Lowes. People and products change daily always keeping me on my toes. Love being busy and helping Customers and fellow workers.
good,great place to start from the bottom and work your way up. many career advancement opportunity and training provided. everyone comes together like a family and the company truly shows they care about their employees.
good,"I have worked here for 2 years. The hardest part of this job is the physical demands that you face on a daily basis. You truly need to be in shape to lift, survive the heat, and complete simple tasks. I really enjoy working here, but they are not loyal to people who have worked there for years."
good,"A typical day as Head Cashier, opening at 6a, inspection of inventory, register loading. I have learned as Head Cashier, as long as I do my utmost best, that I set the example for how others respond.  My co-workers, were very reliable, responsible, our communication with each other pertaining to work was awesome.  The hardest part of the day, is in closing, and you have 10 - 15 customers in the store at 9:15.  The most enjoyable part is when at least 10 of those last minute shoppers make large purchases, such as major appliances."
good,I had the opportunity to work in several different departments and gain a lot of knowledge. Lowes offers great benefits to its employees.
good,"I only worked part time for this company which was owned by my uncle....As as as co-workers, I got along great with them considering everyone was family members of mine....We all got along great and stayed on the same page wich made the job even more easier...."
good,"Although the company is large, I really enjoyed working there and knowing that the managers were there if I had any issues."
good,"Very fast paced and fair company! Work can be anywhere needed for the customer. Customers are the number one priority, period. Need to be flexible and willing to work with others outside of your assigned area. "
good,liked it when it was busy co workers were very helpful and kind but hours dragged by when it was slow the most enjoyable time of day was time to go home
good,"Good company. "
good,"Hours vary, day to day.  Management is easy to work for.  Co-workers are great.  Downfall is job is only seasonal, not full or part-time.  Difficult to obtain a full-time position when you are seasonal."
good,"A typical day starts with unloading the truck with the unloaders,management kinda shows favortism towards some employees."
good,Learned a lot about lumber working in that area and liked my co workers. There wasn't a hard part about the job. I enjoyed helping the customers.
good,I love lowes and I learned so much about them working here. This place is one of my favorite spots I worked at. Great management and staff they were awesome I still talk to them till this day.
good,i work with 2 other co workers we each do our tasks assigned everyday. We work pretty well together. we call the vendors to check status of the customer's products and we call customer to inform them of the eta of their products and explained the next step of their installation.
good,"Greeting and helping customers are a must. The knowledge and training is monthly and graded. Management can be more reliant on employee's to handle situations while they review. Hardest part is lack of help, most enjoyable is the support from accomplishing the goal."
good,"Customer oriented, knowledgeable employees and clean. Management was good overall, lots of experience. Hardest part of the job was making sure we had everything the customer asked for."
good,"Can be a great place to work with the right management team."
good,I enjoy working with the different customers that I meet & most of my coworkers. The pay is great & they are very accommodating with the schedule.
good,Working here I was able to get certified to drive a fork lift and enjoyed working here while I was there. They are very strict on rules which is great at times. Working here was enjoyable and a great experience
good,Daily sales interaction with customers across many different departments. Learned skills needed for basic home improvement/ repair projects. Store management usually wasn't on same page. Great coworkers
good,it is a good job and i like the work i do but it is hard to try to advance when you feel you are being held back. working in a support dept you do not get to work overtime or qualify for any bonuses if you do want overtime you have to come in and work in production doing something you have no idea how to do
good,Lowe's is a  stable company that wants to stay ahead of the curve with trends and technological advancements.  Many employees stay with Lowe's their entire careers.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Lowes, I leaned lots of things about plants and home improvement. Management was great and was always helpful. Great benefits and they would even match our 410Ks. However sometimes the hardest part of the job was the gender boundary. Girl working in a home improvement store will I must not know about tools."
good,It's a great company to work for only downfall is that if the company isn't making their goal they cut our hours. They management at my store is excellent.
good,Pay could be better for the work required.  Lots of work which is rehashed and redone after being told otherwise.  The people are great however compensation needs to be more equitable.
good,good place to work. fun associates and customers. lots of work to keep busy with enough time for customers. can be physical
good,Great company with upside potential. Really go's after the wants and needs customers while also focusing on look and feel of store. Management has opportunities when working on pla
good,"Lowe's is a very steady place to work. It has good and bad qualities just like any other place. There is opportunity to grow and advance in your career. There is opportunity to get bonuses every month, up to a $1.50 more an hour."
good,Very good company to work for. Competitive incentive bonuses promote teamwork.  Corporate office has many desirable career opportunities.
good,"Fast paced, comprehensive field GC Interaction. Lowe's of Union has excellent kitchen cabinet designers."
good,The business was about fast turn around. I worked on Inside Lawn and Garden. There was always new products and equipment  to sale.
good,"Same routine always alert and worked safe."
good,Great Place to work. Great benefits but raises and compensation are not the greatest.   I have been here 7 years but now I must move on into my degree field.
good,"I had the pleasure at working in a large (high volume) store from launch. The store manager was very successful at fostering a sense of one team among the many departments leading to a happier and more productive work place."
good,If you don't mind coming home a little dusty then Lowe's is an ok job. Several opportunities for advancement throughout the company.
good,"i thoroughly enjoyed working for them, the customers were great and the job was a lot of fun all of the time. fun in the sun and tons of great rides, what's not to like? no complaints here!"
good,I wish it were easier to move up in departments. I get frustrated because it feels like I'm the only one working sometimes. Like I care too much and no one else there does. But I do like most of my co-workers and I love being in my department
good,"Gained Knowledge, by completing the proper trainings, on advancing technology such as computers, phones, and other Electronics"
good,There were times when I enjoyed my job and there were times I didn't enjoy my job. It all depended on the management. The turnover was horrible.
good,"It was a good company to work for.  Management, however, needs some work.  They seem to have ""too many chiefs and not enough indians"".  Favoritism seems to be a big problem as well.  On the plus side, they do offer pretty decent pay and excellent benefits, as well as 401k."
good,"One of the first things to learn at Lowe's is that nobody is as smart as they think they are, myself included.  Most interactions with customers, employees, and management require deducing how far above or below themselves they see you both on the metaphorical ladder and in intelligence, and then adjusting your approach accordingly.  When given autonomy, the job can be enjoyable.  When a more involved hand is taken by management, conflicting and frequently contradictory instructions are frequently the result, usually resulting from lack of communication between all moving pieces on the board."
good,The management wasn't very good. But the pay made up for it. Coworkers were pretty great. I really did enjoy my time there it gave me a lot of time to think.
good,"Typical retail store. Merchandising, stocking, helping customers. The management is nice to work for. The biggest negative is undertraining."
good,I spend most of the day making sure each cashier has had a break and lunches as well making sure they are maintaining there post properly. I dealt with day to day complaints and refunds and exchanges. I helped customer find products through out the store efficiently.
good,i did learn alot from working here that is what not to do when your working the trucks
good,"It was a great company to work for,very family oriented.I liked that they wold promote from within.I had good co-workers and very helpfull management team-members."
good,"Lowe's is a fast paced company, with a stable background, promotes"
good,A typical day at works consists of getting a work list done while assisting customer and stocking shelves. I learned that if you want something done right you have to do it yourself. The management varies person to person. The co-workers are at times difficult to work with and other times enjoyable.The hardest part of the job is finding child care that is affordable and can work around your work schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer thanks you.
good,"Typical day at work is at customer helping with returning product, answering phones. Also having customers special order product brought to front at customer service and also processing payments for customers."
good,"a typical day at work was checking out customers. "
good,"As a customer service associate, my duty is to help any customers in my area who may need assistance with product information or product location. Also, I am tasked with ensuring that my assigned department has been restocked and swept prior to the end of my shift."
good,"I just started working in the garden section. I had a customer come ask about what kind of fertilizer to put on their grass. I did not know about that information yet, but I tried to before asking. I grabbed the product and read the back to try to help before I got another associate. I had a lot of associates near that knew their information. It was hard to learn new things right away, but I had my manager that day show me how to find more information and gave me online training. I enjoyed learning something new about something I did not know before. Now I have the information to help out more and now for my own personal self."
good,"I worked in the Hardware/Power Tools section.  I enjoyed the customers that came in and my fellow Associates.  Since I worked the late shift, we had to clean, stock, and close our departments.  After my department was done, I would help the Associates in the flooring and lumber departments.  Those departments entailed more work to finalize."
good,"Working with customers, learn Knowledge of entire store over time. Workers are great down to earth people. Management is okay"
good,Had fun working with all kinds of people with different talents.  I learned a lot bout how to remodel.
good,"Follow-up with customers, answer incoming calls about but not limited to; Iris billing, Iris sales and Iris tech support, respond to customer care emails, check pending dispatches, rejected dispatches, canceled dispatches and case manage escalations."
good,Good company if the right type of management is provided. Company does offer ability to move into other job positions to learn other job skills.
good,"It's not all bad Lowe's as a company is solid, and a good place to work. I am fortunate to work at a store with good management and I get along with all the people I work with. I was able to interact with customers to offer advice and help with their projects. I especially enjoyed using all the equipment to stock the building supply shelves and customers' vehicles. I played a vital role in the installation and sales programs alongside commercial sales. I really enjoyed working here.The only downfall is no overtime is allowed and i am willing to work it this makes the pay to low for expectations."
good,"There is not a typical day at Lowe's other than working with customers, and zone recovery. Most of my week is spent trying to control shrink, work on customer orders, merchandising and any spur of the moment issues that may occur. My favorite part of the job was working in Plumbing, and helping customers find solutions to their problems, inside or outside the box."
good,I run a register and for the most part the register does the work for me. The job does require a friendly attitude and an ability to defray occasional heated tempers of the customers. The overall goal is to get the customer out the door as satisfied as possible. Currently we are unable to keep management and those that we have are not fit for management. In the past we have had great management leaders and still have retained a few of those figure heads. I stay because I love my co-workers. We have a great team and we respect and enjoy each other. I don't feel like I am doing all the work because the duties are shared across the group. There really isn't a hard part of the job but my least favorite is closing. We have a lot of tedious responsibilities that must be complete by the close of the day.
good,Great atmosphere to work in. Would work for them again. I started as a part time worker and they give you good opportunities to move up in the company.
good,"Lowe's , interesting customers.  Seems like always trying to do more with less staff"
good,"Overall my experience with Lowes was a positive experience.  I grew with the company and created what i thought would be my life career."
good,"Good Job"
good,"I will assign employees to registers, give lunches and breaks"
good,most enjoyable part of job was helping customers. management did not for the most part care about their employees. stress was the worst part of the job
good,"I was temp when I was working but there were opportunities to grow within the company. The hours are retail hours so I always had work and the people were amazing to work with. It did get a little 'Clique-y"" at times but for the most part everybody was cool and easy to get along with. The pay was fair and everybody were treated fairly when handing out pay rates. The environment was great, not many restrictions and overall not a bad place to work"
good,I only worked here as a seasonal employee but was not offered a position because of someone's interpretation of a private phonecall to my mother when I was off the clock. They never asked for clarification of the call which was completely unrelated to work. My husband has a friend who works here as a manager but I wouldn't go back since I am a nurse now. I still like shopping here.
good,I enjoyed my time there. I have tried a few times to get back into the store I worked at but if you don't pass the online testing you can't get an interview. I find this frustrating if you have already worked there. The people I worked with and the customers made it worth staying. At times it was rough working during the summer in the garden center because the register was in direct sun in 97 degree heat.
good,"Helping customers"
good,"I liked working at Lowe's for the responsibilities I was assigned and most of the coworkers I had. However, it seemed that management was absent a lot of the time and that upper management was inept at executing proper disciplinary action."
good,Fun workplace. Fun Co-Workers. Managers didn't really help with the problems they wanted us to fix.
good,My time at Lowes was rewarding yet educational. It could be stressful yet fun. My co-workers and mangement and the reltionships I built while there made my job easier on days when we were really challenged. Having the Benifits of different programs that they offered were very benificial to my life. Being able to get to know my regular Contractors and Customers was satisfying knowing they looked forward to seeing me and joking with them. I prided myself in knowing that they would say they always looked forward to seeing me and would wait to go through my register knowing they would leave with a laugh and a smile. I enjoy dealing with the public and making it a very enjoyable experience for not just myself but my customers.
good,"Pro:"
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's, it was always something to do or to work on. I've never saw myself not being busy at Lowe's. A typical day for me was to clock in, he'd to the break room to get my vest, then to the floor. You'll enter act with some so many different people, it kinda make's the day go past faster. Management needs to improve I'd say. I've seen a few zone managers fired, and a few hired in less than a year. For the most part Lowe's hires good people, so you always get a long with lot's of co-workers. One of the hardest things about my job was, management. It's like one is  one the same page."
good,"I would normally work through each of my screens, call customers, work folders, pay invoices."
good,"Lowe's was a rewarding and fun job to work at. In the time that I was there-I had been through four top supervisors. The only problem was that the newest one and myself could not see ""eye to eye"" on certain matters that concerned the receiving area,therefore. he let me go. However, my day started out unloading lumber and cement trucks at 7:00 a.m. in the morning. This continued all day. I had a great deal of fun unloading trucks with the forklift. It seemed to make the day go by quicker. I learned how to be careful unloading trucks with the forklift and I only had one mishap in the years that I was there. My co-workers were the best crew that one could ever ask for. They were very personable and fun to be around with. The hardest part of my job consisted of putting appliances away on the racks that we had set up in receiving. Whenever a receiving truck would come in during the evening, we would get a number of appliances on them and it was my duty to put the appliances away in the racks. Some of those appliances were heavy, but I managed to do my job well. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people in receiving that I worked with. We would even have cook-outs at one of the employees homes for a ""get together"" with our family and friends. That was very enjoyable. Overall, I did enjoy my job at Lowe's Home Improvement and that is why I would like another receiving job because it is a lot of fun."
good,"Busy; rewarding; friendly, enjoyed all the staff, worked well as a team"
good,"I work 5:30 am to 9:30 am four to five times a week, I am the water girl for the Outside Garden Department and I work with the Live Nursery Specialist everyday, I water all the plants that we have on site. I have learned so much about plants and how to take care of them. I have also learned how to order product through different vendors that we work with. I enjoy working with my coworkers because they enjoy the department they work in. The hardest part of the job is not being able to work enough hours. I enjoy the fast pace and yet relaxation of watering the plants and helping customers."
good,"Okay place to work. Good coworkers, you are a number.  I was a coach and the support staff was hit and miss.  Not a bad place, could be better on work life balance."
good,"This job is mentally stressful but given the right balance can be very rewarding as well.  Most days are fast paced and you need to constantly be thinking on your feet.  There are plenty of negative customers but the thankful, polite customers make it worth the stress."
good,Plenty of room for advancement. Customers can be alot of fun to interact with. Good compensation and great benefits.
good,liked the stocker shift m-f had great benefits and management was understanding
good,"I really enjoyed working here, the environment was fast paced and energetic."
good,"Lowe's has a great starting salary ($3 above minimum wage where I live) and provides a fair amount of opportunities to become a permanent employee if you started seasonally.  Some drawbacks at my store, however, were that management was rarely available, and they played favorites.  Unfortunately my store had a lot of gossips, but management has to take everyone seriously and some very good employees got the crummy end of the stick because they made an enemy of a coworker with friends in high places."
good,"It is retail, so your hours can be crazy.  Management is different from store to store, but for the most part is good.  It is fast paced most of the time.  You are on your feet all day long."
good,I learned alot. customer service is number 1 and should be. Trained in several different dept. I loved being a sales specialist and helping customers all day
good,"Learned alot of skills, excellent co-workers, management was very efficient."
good,As a CSA I worked closely with the customers. answering décor questions and mixing paint
good,"Your day can be 6 am to 3 pm or 3 pm to 12 am. Freight, stocking, customer service."
good,"I really enjoy working for lowe's, it has all the normal problems like any other organization, but all-in-all it is a great company to work for. They are very understanding and the management is really good about treating everyone the same. I was a customer service cashier for 5 years and it was okay, I got bored with it, but I like the people I worked with and I enjoyed management so it was worth it. I think the best part of the job was cross training in other departments, I was able to go to different departments sometimes to ""get away"" from the customer service desk."
good,"Working at Lowe's is a great experience for first-time job goers! However, it takes a while to advance within the company if you aren't close with the managers on a personal level. You have the opportunity to work cash registers, run customer service and deal with returns, and walk the floor assisting customer needs. While employed at Lowe's, you can learn a great deal about construction and basic home needs, making it valuable for anyone looking to get a house or do renovations. "
good,"Job culture is low because moral for the most part was low and none of the upper management, knew or cared how to boost it. "
good,"Great company to work for just hard to get in full time, the people I work with are great and the management make the job fun. The start of my day is scanning the store for inventory replenishing and running the reports necessary for the down stocking for maxim products on shelf. I fix any pricing issues, and audit departments to make sure pricing is correct. If I find issues I correct them  and make sure all signage is in place or taken down when sales are over"
good,"dealing with  the public interacting I was an assistant manager at one time, co workers all got along, hardest part of the job was when I got robbed at gun point but I still continued to work afterwards.  most enjoyable I would say interacting with people around my community"
good,"Well a typical day at work is slow and have to find something "
good,"I love to see the same customers coming back."
good,Local grocery store based in Texas. Good starter job while your in school.
good,"Everyone greets other employees, you just right into the departments with both feet. "
good,The job is easy and very convenient but in the end there is no where to go. As a team member you hit top out pay of just over 16$ an hour in 3 1/2 years. Only way to make more is to become a personal instructor (1 dollar more on the hour) or become a coach that makes salary.
good,Lowes provides decent pay and a friendly welcoming environment. It's much like any other retail environment except much more fast paced and physically demanding.
good,Work early in the mornings and is a good place to work. People are fun and is a good schedule to work.
good,Fast paced environment that allows you to express yourself through customer service and leardership skills.
good,If you like dealing with people all day answering customer question no matter how ridiculous. Management okay but moving up in the business is a pain.
good,Good stepping stone to a better career. You will learn a lot about your home
good,Overall have enjoyed working at lowes seven plus years.Met a lot of great people customers and employees likewise.Just can't see myself doing this the rest of my life.
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for but if you are a national guard member lowe's will question your drill weekends and then fire you if you miss day during the work week.
good,"high demands no scheduled time to complete task, Manager in title only"
good,"They are a good place to work for, and good insurance for full time and part employees, but it is bad during winter all part timer's are put down to 10 hours a week"
good,A typical day was helping customers with their everyday home projects and stocking shelves. Management was understaffed and were hardly available when you needed them for assistance. My co-workers were great people and were always willing to help me when I needed it. The hardest part of my job was trying to fulfill orders for contractors when we didn't have the inventory available. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with great customers and my co-workers.
good,"Work can be fun depending on who you meat"
good,"I did alot of traveling and found myself out of the office more than in it.  My travels lead me to peoples homes' where I had the opportunity to meet new people daily.  I was always out to make a client, someone that was going to need me one day and would call me for just that.  Overall was a great experience and work environment, inside and outside of the office."
good,"Lowes has taught me so very much. I learn more everyday about selling, presenting to a customer, and how to expand my experience and knowledge base. They offer great benefits and do their best to acknowledge all that their employees do for the company. Have offered lots of growth potential also."
good,alright place to work other then management management makes promises not abnle to keep
good,While the salary and commission structure wasn't the greatest.  It was probably one of the best places I have ever worked
good,The employees at Lowe's are extremely nice. I have worked at Lowe's for almost 9 years with little advancement and a lot of promises.
good,"forklift driver, shipping and receiving, sorting, picking"
good,"Clock in, grab vest from locker n go to your department."
good,This is a part time weekend position consisting primarily of customer service
good,"fun working environment, energetic coworkers, sometimes employees opinions are not considered but overall, great place to work"
good,"I enjoy going to work but sometimes it can be very stressful although Management is most of the issue."
good,Lowe's is a strong company that is still revamping its' culture. Each store team is different and is based on the leadership team's ability to adapt.
good,I worked here for a year and was walked out for attendance but was a point shy of what i was accused of having. This place isn't scared to replace you the day before you're fired.
good,"lowes is the classic big box retailer who grows managers from with in. on a daily basis you will be tested I nthe area of customer service issues, merchandising, and sales culture training. the hardest part of the job was the constant rotation of store managers. the best part of the job was the experience you received as an assistant store manager by running a 30 million dollar a year retailer."
good,"Good job.  Show up do your part and get paid.  Nice place to work, good pay."
good,"I worked for a company that worked for Lowes, which meant that I worked with a lot of the Lowes Employees."
good,"Lowe's is a fast paced environment. An average day at work would include checking customer orders as well as pulling them, building flooring plans for customers, being able to multitask and being very customer oriented. Management is very helpful. The hardest part of the job is not having enough people that work there to get everything done. Lowe's is a high volume store and it would be helpful if more people worked there to handle the high volume."
good,the company it self is great it is the management that really causes problems. lack of commutation between team leader and upper management
good,"At the Customer Service level it is a very pleasant job. Customers are friendly and corporate culture supports a friendly helpful environment."
good,I enjoyed communicating with different people and helping customers. Unloading a truck was very fun doin. My co workers was nice and helpful and great team mates
good,"Working At Lowes Hardware is a fun work place. Lots of wonder people, as well as customer."
good,"Lowe's Canadian RDC 3109 is an overall well-rounded warehouse environment to work in. They are patient and encourage team-building in a fast paced environment. Management is understanding and takes advice from employees regularly. Working at Lowes helped teach me how to delegate, prioritize and operate in an efficient and effective manner. The co-workers are understanding and reliable and offer good insight and personal friendship. The hardest part of the job would be working the 10 hour shifts and repetitively lifting heavy product. I enjoy operating all the heavy equipment offered and being able to work on my own time rather then be time-stricken."
good,"I would go in at 8am worked in the Install coordinator position made sure all the installs for the day were ready to go out.  Pulled all files for that days installs, confirmed all installers were ready for that day.  Handled any issues with the install.  Calming customer, getting product re-ordered if there was a problem with the product. RTM numbers and  compensation for the customer time if need be. Made all calls for the next days installs to remind customers. Made all follow up calls for the day prior installs to confirm they were completed to there satisfaction. Sent all payment requests for installers to corporate office, filing, answering phones and occasionally ran a register. I learned to manage my time and be very detail oriented.   The hardest part of my job was often being short handed.  I loved that my job was not predictable it made my job exciting and I enjoyed being able to help all my customers with all there needs even the ones that were extremely upset.  I think I am a very good problem solver if given the opportunity."
good,"Typically everyday I am very busy with mostly paperwork.  I learn something new everyday about store operations.  I enjoy working with a lot of different people who have a mix of personalities and I get along with everyone.  The hardest part of my job is actually getting credit from our Merchandisers.  I do love my job because it is full time with great benefits and I am constantly learning and that is very important to me, I just wish I made more money and had even more advancement."
good,"Help out customers ,customer transactions"
good,Continuous relaibility on eachother. We looked out for one another to ensure proper safty standards were met along with customer satisfaction. Always ensured that no one man was left behind to handle more than he/she could handle.
good,"Typically did 3-4 appointments a day. Most of the time,I wasn't given enough time to do a good,complete presentation. Which "
good,"Eight hours each day with fluctuation (opening or closing store)"
good,"Typical day is processing customers purchases."
good,This is a great part-time job. The way is vey good for a second job but the hours are not so great.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customers and helping them to make decisions to improve their biggest investment.....their home. My co-workers were fun, dedicated, and loyal. This provided a family like network. The hardest part of the job was trying to squeeze in all of your duties with and still provide superiour customer service with no help or direction from management. I learned that I have a love for helping people and watching my team grow and succeed. My typical day involved physical security, customer service, cash handling, bookkeeping, sales, HR, training, schedules, payroll, inventory and audit compliance."
good,Typical day at work includes answering phones and customer questions. My interaction with co-workers helps me balance home life and work life since it gives me a chance to work with people who have the same goal as me. The hardest part of the job is not having enough hours at work. It is a part time position. Other than that it's a good place to work.
good,good company to work for. very friendly staff and management
good,a good place to work great benifites and room for advancement
good,I enjoyed working in the store with customer. I felt as though there was no privacy between management.
good,"Customer service is a premium. I worked in the delivery department the last two years.  Primarily delivered appliances to customers homes.  Learn many skills to include : Installations of doors, windows, appliances.  Figuring construction products for houses.  Good management and co-workers.  Enjoyed working with the public and helping to solve customers problems.  An awkward work schedule (because I had custody of my children) forced me to leave the company."
good,was pleased to work with company until change in management
good,"Doesn't work well with family issues, tell you just before end of shift you have to stay till job is finished... Even if just started"
good,Had fun and learned a lot in the short time I was there. Only got to work for three months as a seasonal employee.
good,really enjoyed working with public at lowes.  however management was inconsistent in scheduling.
good,"Greeting customers, assisting them with their purchases. answering the phones and cleaning."
good,loved the people and managers i worked with. pay was pretty decent. made. one big family. would for sure work there again.
good,"The CEO determined that lowes employees are to stand in their department and greet customers. No task. Fun atmosphere. Great people to work with"
good,At Lowe's you are always busy and productive. It is never boring there because there is always something to do. There is a lot of heavy lifting and the hours make it difficult for single parents. The environment is a great place to work.
good,"good place to work, just don't expect to get a lot of hours.  Managers don't bother your too much as long as you do your job."
good,I think if new management would  look at the training issues and not just fire people at the bottom and someone that has been there for almost two years and 4 different job titles should mean something.
good,Don't really have a review. I work a cash register in multiple areas in the store provide customer service and do returns.
good,I execute janitorial and maintenance duties as well as tasks to be completed throughout the store. I learned that Lowes offers various benefits for their employees.  With dedication and skill you can get into management. The co-workers from my store are awesome; easy to talk to. Hardest part of the job is maintaining things all at once. Most enjoyable part is working with customers and the employee's.
good,a typical day at lowes begins  by coming in and making sure there are no problems that have arisen from the day before  then its on to customer service  I assist every customer I come in contact with and find out what they are looking for and aid them in locating the exact item or project yjey are looking for
good,Every nice and help each other my management is ok to work with.
good,"I've learned everything from lowes from doing deliveries to working in lumber i've learned everything it takes to redo plumbing and electrical to building a deck."
good,Co-workers were the best and very helpful! Everyone was very caring and understanding.  You could form a bond with everyone.
good,"Customer-focused and fast-paced."
good,"A typical day at this job consists of juggling several tasks at one time.  The day will start with packing out freight, tons of it, and being able to efficiently help customers.  As the day picks up you will have to meet the demands of three managers that are each tiers above you while also helping customers that walk in and call in over the phone.  Not a job for anyone who is just looking for a job to pay the bills."
good,"A typical day at work was handling the freight and inventory and pricing while taking care of customers."
good,"My daily routine while employed here was not really so terrible. I loved the actual work that I did quite a bit. If you are the type of person who enjoys learning specific, hands-on details and the technical foundations of why something is the way it is, and enjoys building a relationship with customers by passing that information along correctly to them, giving them a sense that they can achieve whatever they have in mind, a Product Specialist at Lowe's might be the ideal job for you. "
good,"I have been a part of the company for almost 4 years, working on the front end and as a garden associate; customer service is a top priority in any area of the store and is my forte. Along with being customer focused, having the ability to be a part of a team is also very important, communication with co-workers and management on a professional level is a universal trait that can be applied in many different context within any company."
good,"No overtime what so ever and low morale.  low pay. Great management/supervisors ,outstanding co workers,loved it.Ialso learned to work as a team."
good,"Team atmosphere, associates need to be able to mulit-task and be willing to learning multiple areas of the store to help cover breaks/call outs. Overall a good place to work."
good,"I learned how to work with others. It was frustrating at times, yet amazing at others. I got along well with my co-workers and managers."
good,"  Greeting customers making sure they all item they may need to complete the project. helping load, entering estimates and setting up delivery's are most common action. Training is common activity, it keeps you up to date in many areas of your jobs."
good,"I learned how to handle the different types of customers, how to place orders, take different kinds of payments such as through a company, restock the items, return the items, take down orders, and inventory"
good,I enjoyed working at Lowe's and would consider working there again. 
good,Use forklift to stock and restock lumber. Cut wood for customers. Cashier when needed. 
good,Very dynamic work environment. A great many people from different cultures and backrounds to learn from and work with. 
good,I gained a better understanding of tools and cash registers. It was a very friendly and usually upbeat place to work.  My managers were more hands on than I expected.
good,"Very busy call center environment. Sometimes fun, sometimes a headache, but people are very nice and work setting is excellant. Downside is occasionally you get very obusive and irrate customers who vent on you because you are the one at the other end of the phone, but most customers are nice and just need your help."
good,"Customer service associate "
good,"Meet and Greet customers and use the IMPACT model to sell appliances.  I = initiate contact"
good,"Enjoy working here,I have a great rapport with co workers,customers and management.My typical day is helping customers and cashing out their purchases."
good,"Always fast paced.  Wile at Lowe's I learned to run a register and work as a team although the store was large.  I learned how to communitcate with my co-workers, and express myself to market sales to my customers  The hardest part of the job is being the only person who knows how to adjust to stressful situations. The best part of the job are the people you work with."
good,A typical day at Lowe's Home Improvement was work 8 or more hours working with customers at the customer service desk. Answered any and every question a customer had about their special orders. Resolved customers complaints or involved appropriate manager to ensure customer satisfaction.
good,The distribution center I was employed at had too many uncaring managers.
good,A typical day consisted of me assisting customers with their purchases by helping them select the best product for any plumbing issues they had.  
good,I would help the customers that needed to have their homes remodeled; it was a very challenging job but did not leave me much time for schooling. Management was not as helpful as I would have liked but over all I did enjoy working there. I did find that balancing work and school was very difficult for me because this company changes your work schedule at a daily bases. 
good,"I was always learning something new everyday, and had fun talking to customers. "
good,"Excellent benefits, but not much advancement.  My schedule has never been consistent and positions are not picked by experience. "
good,I have only been there 12 weeks and it's on a temporary/seasonal basis so I do not know about any of their benefits. It is a very productive workplace where customer service is number one with all employees. Everyone is friendly and helpful.
good,"I enjoy working with this company overall. However my financial needs have changed, hence I am seeking another career."
good,"You have the opportunity to meet and help a variety of different people, with all different backgrounds and skill levels. It's a great place to hone your people and conversational skills, while allowing you to learn something new every day."
good,The job i was a fast pace most of the time that i really enjoyed i work with others that work with me and shop in the store.I learn more about construction and hard work. Management was good they help out a lot and made sure i had what i need to do my job.I really did have nothing hard about my job because i loved being busy and loved a challenge and like to be success full.
good,Overall good company untill they started micromanaging and taking away compensation.
good,The main drawback is there is no work/life Balance. it is all consuming
good,Company is consistent and has strong structure. Company pays and that's all that really matters. Not a bad company not a great company at this time still trying to establish itself in the market as a contender.
good,Lowe's HIW is good company to work for. Very easy to learn and move up in the company.
good,Schedule based job with relieving of shift work. Good benefits if you were full-time. It was always good to meet and talk with people and learn from there experience in that certain department (customers).
good,"get in, go to my assigned area, help customers as them come in with whatever I can, or get them to the right department."
good,Lowe's is morphing into the Wal-Mart of home improvement. This is a bad thing.
good,it was a fun place to work. People and managers were kind and respectful.
good,I wish the schedules where better. More consistant work schedulwe would make things better.
good,"A typical day at work would be answereing the phones and transfering the calls to the correct department, data entry for orders, ringing up customer, and filing. I learned how to be a team player by working with my co-workers to help each customer get the best customer service we could give. i enjoyed working with my co-workers very much and made a lot of friends. The hardest part of my job was the clean up at the end of the day. The most enjoyable was talking with customers. Manage was excellent.always availabe."
good,this jobI was happy goin job keep you busy all the time I learnhow to use diffence machine like forklite and ridin pallet jack .managerment was good too work with every body help everybody with no problem they gave all sort prize
good,"If you can't get a more professional job or are in need of an immediate position, this is a great place to work."
good,Loved customer serceive helping people with their sale and purchases.Promoting programs and helping with any problems.I would order item from catologs and vendors .Promote store programs such as credit cards mylowes etc.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Lowes. We were busy early morning until mid afternoon.I began by cleaning the receiving dock from night crews refuse , received in and checked in UPS and FEDEX. I then awaited arrival of LTL carriers and checked in their shipments. When there was a lull I cleaned receiving and assisted floor employees with appliance back stock ,and rolls of carpet etc. I learned the in and outs of receiving. The crew at Lowes complement each other. We worked well together. The most difficult part of my job was getting a jump on cleaning up whatever night crew was unable to get to. The sense of pride I took in keeping receiving clean and organized while working with my co-workers . We supported each other well!"
good,"typical day I would say would be pretty busy. There's always something to do. I learned a lot about lumber, hand tools, power tools, paint, and a lot about outside lawn and garden. Management I would say was pretty fair. I mean sometimes they kind of wanted you to do a lot in a little amount of time, but I mean that's with any job. Co-workers were pretty friendly. People kept to their self a lot, but if you needed help they wouldn't mind lending a hand. Hardest part about the job would be the hours. One day you would be working 2-11pm and the next morning you would have to be there at like 4am or 5am so that was kind of tuff. Last the most enjoyable part about the job was working outside and you rotated weekends. So it wasn't like the same person had the weekend off every weekend, and you get bonuses"
good,Good Team-work with co-workers.
good,55+
good,"Coworkers Were Childish, I Felt That There Wasnt Much Room To Advance"
good,"Co-workers were good and supportive. Sometimes extremely monotonous. You need to know what you're area before you get a position in a department you know nothing about. They gave me quite a large number of hours because of under-employment. You'll get a large amount of freedom but often I found myself not knowing what to do for hours at a time. Basic retail work as in long hours of standing, customer service, and zoning(cleaning up the section). They give you basic training that is paid for the hourly compensation"
good,"Took great pride in accomplishing my goals and always making budget. Made sure I had happy employees, who in turn produced excellent and quality work."
good,"My days would begin by showing up early and setting up pallets/powered equipment to get it prepared for the unloading process. Next I would fill out paperwork and wait til the team arrives. Upon arrival we would begin unloading which would take approximately 3 hours of lifting and moving. Finally finishing we would pull the freight out to the floor and stock it until our shift was over. After working there for a while I moved up in the ranks enough that I was the senior Unloader and was in charge of new tasks, such as training new employees and filling out the paperwork. I feel that I got along very well with my managers and knew each of them on a good professional level. My coworkers I never had trouble with I am very easy going and open minded so I never had an issue with meeting them. I love to meet new people as well so it was always exciting to see a new employee to train and incorporate in our crew. The hardest part of the job was definitely maintaining a safe work environment, however was very rewarding to be praised for doing so above standards. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the relationships formed with fellow coworkers, you felt as though you were really part of a team and an essential part in it at that, and that made me really enjoy my work."
good,"The greatest part about the job was being able to do my job without interference. You were just expected to do your job, and everyone here got along with one another. Great place to work."
good,"I liked my job, customer service and taking care of the plants and trees. Making sure the customer was taking care of I took the initiative in making displays and my daily duties and went over and above for employer and customer."
good,"Put out merchandise, customer service, operate register"
good,I really enjoyed helping customers with there home improvement needs. I also liked the fact that I stayed busy for my whole work shift.
good,Lowe's is a great place to work for anyone willing to get into retail.
good,"Lowe's is constantly changing to meet the needs of their customer's. Change is good in some ways, but also not productive in other ways. finding the middle ground is necessary."
good,"Most of the day you will spend standing at a register helping customers with their products. if you work in a department, your time will be spent answering questions and walking around and carrying heavy products from receiving to the front."
good,"I was stated as being a GREAT worker, management liked me , I helped my department receive bonuses for saved production and customer service. After my seasonal position was over, I was let go. They had positions open on the inside , but when I applied , they said my name was sent back into a pool. Yet, they hire someone new for those spots . I was ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM!!! Why couldn't they put me there instead of hiring off the street and have to retrain them and waste money on drug tests??? RIDICULOUS!!! I haven't had employment since that was in JULY 2012."
good,"This was a very good company to work for. I started in the Campbellsville, KY store and later transfered to the Elizabethtown store. It was very hard to get opportunities to advance if you were not in ""good"" with the managers. They had their favorites. I am looking to advance in a career."
good,Its hard work doing all the jobs but I help where needed and they take great care of us. They have employee appriciation luncheons and have it all catered to us.
good,Not too bad of a job. Would like to see more of a team effort when it comes to helping each other out.
good,"A typical day at work consists of processing sales, payments and returns. Answering and transfering phone calls. Making copies, faxes and mailing information. I believe management could use some work on communication and equality. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I can help a customer and the are completely satisfied with their experience at Lowes."
good,"good place to work minus some of the people. you were given the chance for cross training, and advancement. family oriented. offered training in different things."
good,My day start by checking on my customers that i have made estimates for and making sure my customers get what they need.I've learned more how to management my time more with customers scheduling and making appointments.My crew at lowes have a good working relationship at work. And the hardest part of my job is staying on top of the installers.the most enjoyable part of my job is making the customers happy.
good,"A typical day for me would be to provide customer service. I also check out the customer purchases, collecting and distributing money. I also kept my area clean. I learned to provide quality customer service and to operate a cashier machine. My co- workers were great and they help to make work enjoyable. The hardest part about my job was dealing with and unsatisfied customer who does not understand retail."
good,Learned how to use different types of materials handling. For instance : Forklift
good,The days are great the people I work with are good the way the mangers work they want puppets not workers
good,"would stock the shelves department by department, then continue on to top stocking. I would top stock heavy items with the order picker. days we didn't have top stock, we would continue on to menial customer service activities."
good,"Worked here while attending college, great place to balance life if needed, flexible hours"
good,"I enjoying working for a big box company however, I want a new and exciting change. I want a place that I can develop, grow and not be held back because of selfish reasons."
good,This company is great to work for if you are a high school student or a college student. Part timers get health insurance which that is cool. I would have to say that management needs to work on there managers.
good,"The expectations were the hardest part. Once I set a bar I had to constantly push it farther. I was on power equipment all the time and in the time I wasn't I was always trying to learn new departments. Co-workers were like my family. We are close and can always count on each other. Every month we would do an add a dish. That would have to be the best and most enjoyable part, being able to get along with co-workers and enjoying your work."
good,Enjoyed working with my fellow employees. Customers were friendly too. Was a rewarding job.
good,"Very good place to work if you are willing to actually work. Wages are relatively low, but the benefit package is exceptionally nice."
good,This company is good but if your looking for something with advancement please continue you search.
good,like working with the management staff.also have made good friends there nice working enviroment.
good,Problem solving of customers and employees
good,Lowe's is overall a good place to work. The employees become like family. My only complaint is the retail hour system such as opening at 6 for several days then switching to 1:30 to 10:30. They are brutal to your system.
good,I love working at lowes. have learned many ways to deal with customers and have made a lot of great friends through the company. i respect a lot of the people i work for and have had an amazing time learning through the company.
good,Overall Lowes as a company is wonderful but lowes my store specific was not very professional or together.
good,was only ther for one year and the company has changed alot sence 1993 but it was a good place to work back then
good,worked long hours and made sure i load trucks so the ship ments could be shipped out in time for delivery.
good,Lowe's is a nice place to work
good,"Process the sales, while straighting the inventory. Restocking in the evening. General cleaning."
good,"A typical day working at Lowes was usually pretty easy going. In the head cashier position, you are expected to be everywhere at once. That's not realistic, but you just have to try your best. I learned how to not fold under pressure and maintain composure in stressful situations. It really depends on the area you are in, as to how the co-workers are. I've been in 3 different stores and they really ranged in the type of personalities you dealt with. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the people on a personal level during the down time. I have made some great friends while working for Lowes."
good,As a head cashier I checked the cashier board and made sure all cashiers and loaders had breaks and lunches assigned then prepared registers with receipt tape cash and change. If there were any customer complaints or problems and I was able to help them I would if not I would get someone in management to assist them.
good,Can move up if you work hard. Must like high pace enviroment.
good,"Lowe's in Maryland was like family and the Lowe's in Belmont , NC. I transfer an my co-worker and Mangerment are helping me. The customer are really great."
good,I had never worked inside be no hot or cold days for that was nice learned retal managed 5 co workers got along real well no hard jobs in lowes and the people were most enjoyable
good,they didnt train me very good and it was seansonal they pay was good
good,I worked in the front as a head cashier. Every single shift since I started there in Oct 2010 they only had bare minimum coverage so...if ONE person called in sick which they did daily your shift was screwed. Your cashiers would look at you like its your fault that there is no coverage for a break or lunch. I had NOBODY to give them one. Not even myself because management changed it where you as a head cashier cant get on a register or be actively pushing back returns or bringing in carts. They wanted all head cashiers upfront and directing traffic. Well when a customer came up and saw only 1 register open and you are calling for back up with no response the only one that looks like a fool is you. I was so tired of that. So I would get on a register and 4 people would need me else where and then I was in trouble. No thanks!!!
good,"Lowe's, in general, is a great company to work for. Overall the associates are treated well and offered benefits at both part time and full positions. As with most big box stores, the politics does tend to be a bit much. most of the positions have fair wages."
good,Working on orders and setting up installations for customer and closing the sale.
good,"I loved this job it was just a bit to unstable with a changing schedule and did not offer much room to advance within the company unless switched to different area of work or different store, the co workers were easy to get along with and communication between co workers was very easy with the phones they provide for you, not a very exciting job i spent hours just walking around waiting for the time to pass which was not for me, the schedule was my biggest complaint and the fact that they hired family members of other co workers and hired friends so it was very clicky."
good,"Helped customers load what they perchased. Restocked stone, mulch, fertilizer and other gardening supplyes. Co-workers where pretty easy to get alonge with although sometimes there was drama, which i stayed out of. The hardest part of the job was moving large quantities of sod but the fun part was operating the forklift and reachtrucks."
good,A typical day is very fast paced. Good people to work for though management is lacking in some areas.
good,"challenging work envioment with the ability to provide great customer service. dealing on a dayly bases with different customers on different situations, providing successful solutions, being knowledgeable of the needs of the customers, working with members of staff in achieving company goals, open communication with upper managemant teams expressing new idears to better the company as a hole.the most enjoyable part of the job is when customers comes back to the store asking for you by name due to the fact that you provided them with outstanding customer service ang knowing because of you this customer will always continue to come back.the hardest part of the day is were a customer was not serve properly by another employee and now that costumer is not satisfied and walk out of the door with a bad view of the company. as a people person it is my believe to always put your best foot foward."
good,I think lowes has great benefits & great atmosphere but I am looking forward to a career. This job is good for some side money as a student or retired workers!
good,Everyday is a challenge. Always tasked with something new to do.
good,Good place to start or for a part time job. Would not reccomend for students as scheduling is hard to keep constant. Otherwise a decent place to work.
good,"This is a great company to work for, as with all there are alot of poor managers. I would rate this GREAT if it werent for the store I worked in."
good,Some management is good and some need more training. The hardest part of the job is communicating between employees and management. The work load is fair but some days is more hectic than others. Most of the employees are not reliable but the company works with them anyway. They are flexible with the schedule but at times there is conflict.
good,Provided outstanding customer service by making sure all customers were properly greeted and assisted. Generated worksheet report showing sales for each month.
good,"I loved my position as a Credit coordinator! It was hard work but very rewarding, never a dull moment!"
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers and I liked the products Lowe's carried. I was paid well. Besides our store closing, the only real issue I had was being scheduled to close and then open the following morning. It was rough getting out at 11pm and getting up to go back at 6am and that doesn't take into account drive time. Other than that, I really did enjoy Lowe's."
good,Retail.....Odd shifts. Good customer base no incentives to perform.
good,I loved this place great people and lots of physical work!Lots to learn if you know nothing about tools!
good,"I love where I work, the only complaint I have is the work schedule and only having one saturday off a month."
good,I enjoyed working at lowe's back in 2003 it was a fun and place to work the people where very friendly and the customers where always coming back because they knew they always got great customer service as well as the supply's they need.
good,/very fast paced energetic environment. In regards to retail structure the strongest in the industry.
good,I decline to write a review. It's been a while since I've worked there.
good,"Lowes is a great place to work if you're a student looking for a part time job. They work around your school schedule and understand that school comes first. I've always enjoyed being at work, and the people I work with. There are plenty of opportunities to learn something new at Lowes."
good,A little clique-ish at first but a really decent place to work in a part time retail environment...dealing with older military veterans is challenging
good,The fellow staff members were great to work with. The atmosphere among team members bwad great. The provided contests throughout the store that were fun to participate in.
good,"Work life balance begins to suffer once you become salary."
good,Great associates. Harassment was not addressed by corp.Great vendors. Loved my job. New female store manager openly harassed and fired over 50 age employees and got away with it.
good,As with any retail job it can be stressful at times but there are good people there to help. My current manager is a great person and cares about her employees
good,my coworkers worked well as a team. The benefits could be better. the hours were flexible. The company discount was reasonable. The management worked well with the employees.
good,"Typical retail issues of being under staffed, but overall is was a great place to work as far as retail goes. Good environment and great people...…..."
good,It’s very good company to work for. But the unexpected and consistent schedule changing led me to have great difficulty being on time.  I had a good rapport with management and they wanted to advance me because of my social skills. Unfortunately the schedule just would not allow me to hold out.
good,"Being a headcashier can be difficult; you don't have the official ""supervisor"" title but you are considered first level management, so some people don't and won't listen to you but you are still expected to manage the front end. There is a lot of diversity and many challenges/obstacles, but once you get used to it, and past the first couple months of people just not liking you, it can be really fun."
good,"Love working for Lowe’s great company and benefits, how ever currently the company culture is undergoing a change, at the moment it feels in a negative direction as it seems Lowe’s seems to be copying evening Home Depot is doing"
good,I really enjoyed working there...the only draw back is that I had to quit because I wasn't getting enough hours and they didn't work with the other job schedule I had. Their flexibility is VERY limited...so if you're an adult with bills to pay it could be challenging.
good,"Not a terrible place to work, can mostly have set schedules. Just needs to pay more. All in all, it's got a fair advancement structure if you're willing to work many different departments."
good,Was a good place to work. Met many friendly people willing to help. Management was helpful but sometimes put customers before employees in regard to delivery schedule and hours worked.
good,You need to be able to pull your own weight and able to lift 50 lbs more than once. This is a fast pace job with a lot of multi tasking. Customer Friendly and staying safe and in stock are top priority.
good,"Working as a cashier is a great way to build experience in the professional world, especially for newcomers. While it can be tedious at times, it's an incredibly effective way of learning and developing."
good,Lowes has a wonderful crew of people that are willing to help new people learn their job. Very friendly and very helpful. 1 hour lunch is provided in every 6 to 8 hour shift.
good,"Good place to work with good work life balance, company is investing highly on new technology which is a good sign for learning for employees. Overall good"
good,"Use to be enjoyable before CEO change, and corporate took over scheduling. Not a bad place to work if you can handle the idea you are a # to corporate"
good,"I love flowers, and found myself in the store so much, and decided to work with plants and people to match the plants for their planting needs."
good,"Everyone there was really nice and easy to work with, but the managers have an issue with understanding personal health. They require to do large tasks and get it done very swiftly, but they expect you to help customers, meaning you can't find an in-between. So either you help customers, or you do a task that they will always find a reason to complain to you about."
good,"Worked there for a few years, not a bad place to work and management was flexible with my school schedule. Work load was not overwhelming and staffing was decent."
good,Good company to work for. Stock slowly increasing. New leadership has brought in a new mentality trying to compete with the orange box. Company slowly on the rise.
good,"Some days there are busy times there are always customers in need of assistance and others where it's very slow. I only worked in 2 apartments and the usual tasks assigned were to move stock, operate forklifts, clean the department at the end of the day, and assist costumers."
good,I made sure that excellent customer service is givin to all customer and that the store look like a clean and safe environment. The staff was alright but often change as people didnt like the way alot of other managers were.
good,I had fun but I have to step down for personal reasons. I advanced within the company 2 times and I enjoyed the experiences I got from there. New rules were implemented that I don't agree with.
good,"good to work at. great team management. they had days where they would cook for us and hand out tee-shirts. I recommend working here if you need good pay, and a chill environment."
good,"In my specific dept, mobility is limited; was given the opportunity to learn the business; taught how to organize and negotiate vendor details; team cooperation is necessary."
good,Lowes don't discriminated basic on age. Lowes give older worker fair and equal opportunity. Pay is very low. Some worker make less than 12 dollars a hour and when busines is the lose work time.
good,"A typical day is always very motivating everyone is typically really nice, and friendly, and the associates and management are always helpful!"
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes I learned a lot form co-workers and customers. I worked in customer service and in garden center I enjoyed my time in the garden learned a lot about plants form vendors and customer it was fun to interact with customers at Lowes.
good,The good thing about this company was my mid morning hours that was the best. But on the other hand the was to many chiefs and not enough Indians. the commutation was just not there all the time. One manager will tell you to do something and another would come right behind them and tell you something different it's kinda crazy.
good,"Each position can be learned fairly quickly if you're willing to learn it. A majority of the staff is very helpful and encouraging but management could be way better. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude, nasty customers and learning to keep your cool under pressure."
good,Good company. Good benefits. Work with you if you need time off. Supportive. The work hours are all over the place. But still get 40 hours if full time.
good,For a retail company the benefit package for FT employees is great   The hours are as expected and work environment varies by location   Company is large and full of opportunity for advancement if you seek it out
good,A new manager was hired and the lead generation drop to bare minimum in fact 100 leads less than a year before  Within the  same time span. Could not afford to work there anymore.
good,"Lowes is an easy job and a good place to work the only thing they is ever a worry is when they do shift bids and you have to change your shift. And the layoffs or the move to a new city. Other then  that fair pay, fair amount of vacation time and sick time."
good,"This is a great place to work, just dont make it a career or it'll be soul stealing. Other jobs exist and are much better. Customer service is 3 out of 5"
good,"Unlike other retail stores work is easy when you work only as cashier. If they put you in customer service you have to deal with phones, complaints, customer returns, credit cards issues etc.you learn as you go. If you are diligent dont call out be on time and respect your superiors won't have problems. It helps a lot of your direct supervisors have good  knowledge of all the procedures so you can have all the support and learn from them."
good,"left work due to an work injury, management considered me a liability,   otherwise a good place to work. I would go back to Lowe's, but they wouldn't hire me back due to my workers comp claim."
good,I would reccothis job because of the skills you could learn and take with you. It's fun to learn skills such as carpentry and how to fix things on your own
good,"Enterprise is a company that really values it's employees. Customer satisfaction is the main goal, you are provided with everything you need to be successful in your position but leaves something to be desired from a salary stand point."
good,There is a lot to do each day especially when the truck of merchandise is received.  It is a very high turn over of employees. It can also be very physically challenging.
good,Delivery Manager is a liar to employees and customers...will throw you under the truck to make him look good....when you don't deal with him everything is great!!!!
good,"Hated working with the public but I dealt with it, I worked with some good people. Management was not the best at all, but the managers over me were the best ones."
good,"The work environment was awesome and the customers really dedicated the work we did. The only issue I had was management as far as listening to our needs and how to make the work environment really thrive. They were good on hours but as far as teaching us new things, we were left in the dark."
good,Good job. Nice place to work. Well maintained equipment (forklifts). Well lit work space. Friendly co-workers. Job kept me busy. I liked it. I'd probably be back working there if they were hiring.
good,Looking to learn something different. Need something less strength. I’ve learned a lot working for Lowes. Started out as cashier then went to customer service I floor associate
good,"The job is not a bad job to start out. Difficult to build up to the pay you want and each employee gets paid differently, based on experience i’m assuming."
good,"Flexible hours for students and friendly manager"
good,"Lowe's was an absolute wonderful place to work for 26 1/2 years! "
good,Good place and good people. The management was good but constantly changing things. Great place for college students. It’s a retail job but with great coworkers.
good,Keeps you busy make the day go by quick. Team work is getting better. Worth it for the wealth of knowledge you can receive. I learn something new almost very day. I truly enjoy it.
good,"Best place I’ve worked but very Intense "
good,"I have worked at Lowes for a little over a year.  Overall, I am happy with my experience working at Lowes Petoskey.  I have learned a great deal.  I am looking forward to bringing these positive experiences and lessons with me into my next career opportunity."
good,I really enjoy my sales specialist role at Lowe's Canada. I love the problem-solving with customers and coming up with a solution  to their needs. They have very effective on-line training courses such as the S.M.A.R.T. model to help you close the deal.
good,"learned a great deal about home improvement, gained experience with heavy machinery. Lowes pays well hourly, but it is important to get a full time position, part time employees are not given much attention"
good,"Most often I was excited to begin my day at work. I enjoyed the culture in the workplace, every person is embraced for who they are and given ample opportunity to share their voices. We had two team meetings each day to discuss sales and expectations, safety and ongoing missions within the store and the community. Management is primarily new to their role, with one senior ASM on the floor. "
good,The managers team could have been better they where looking out for there self's and not the store. The customer service was a rat race one manager would do one thing and the other would not do the same
good,"Working at Lowes was a great work experience to learn about the warehouse and stocking the company merchandise correctly, as well as training for the front end department jobs incase needed."
good,"The management at Lowe's (at least while I was there) was amazing and very understanding. Unfortunately, the hours that they would give people to work throughout the week were very inconsistent, which was the driving factor of leaving. They take past work experience into account when deciding your pay rate."
good,Great place to learn the industry.  Lowes always treats its employees with respect and typically frontrunners when it comes to moving the needle in the industry.  Enjoyed my time there and the people.  Only downside as with any retail establishment....there was little to no life/work balance.
good,"The coworkers make the job that much better. We treat each other like a family, because we often see each other more than our families. The work days are long and sometimes stressful."
good,Great place to work  very poor management. Lazy management. I enjoy who I work with. Wish the pay was a little higher than what I am paid. I am trained for any power equipment
good,"Challenging butInteresting "
good,"Overall had a good experience working for Lowe's. Sure, some policies and practices could stand to be improved upon or made more efficient, but it's an American corporation. Never going to be perfect. I find that the culture in the stores makes for a healthy environment. If you're willing to give your all, managers will notice. Plus the managers keep an open dialogue with lower level personnel in order to better serve them and the customers."
good,"I'm thinking that my Lowes employee files would say enough."
good,I loved working for Lowe's until the very end. Every day was a new challenge that I concord.The only hard part of the job was working during snow storms.
good,"Requires more decisions to be taken by the India team not always depend on the us team."
good,Just too much change too quickly..I can adapt but it's daily. Great place to work if you're a hands on Manager. Decent compensation package and benefits
good,"Other then the fact that I have to left for a very stupid reason it was a very good job. Most of the people at my store were very kind minus a few managers and one 'supervisor', if you can really call them that. Its a really good first retail job. Most locations are fast pace, contractors and many customers coming in throughout the day and many internet orders coming through. Its a good place"
good,Lowes was a great place to learn more about cashiering and to learn the life of an everyday builder or gardener. The management was somewhat alright. When hired Lowes was in the progress of finding new management.
good,Pay is based off experience. Benefits are great for full time and part time. You get a bonus at the end of each quarter if the team exceeds the store goal.
good,This Loss Prevention position focuses heavily on operational and internal losses.  Worked in a large city market and I had the most external apprehensions for the year with 17.  Other stores in the market had 0-4 and one other with 12.  There is little as far as advancement opportunities in Loss Prevention and in the 3 years I was there Districts were expanded and District Manager positions eliminated.
good,I enjoy working at Lowe's. There are advancement opportunities. The leadership is top notch and cares a lot about their employees. Would definitely recommend working for them.
good,I would say that it was an overall good experience . It helped me learn patience. And obstacles that I felt like I couldn’t face . It also helped me challenge myself by interacting with different customers
good,Great work environment ..upper management does a good job for the workers.. They take care of everyone as far as benefits go. I was in need of higher pay. If I could've gotten that👉 I would still be there.. Love Lowe's & what they do for their ppl..
good,Enjoyed working with people on call center and could develop good relationships with customers. Was fun to help customers and find out what was happening with their order or package and work to find a solution
good,"The work days were always filled with things to do.  Customers to help constantly.  The company was great to work for, it was the management that exhibited little class or tact... hardest part of the job was staying motivated."
good,Go to work around 6 am started watering plants. trying to get them watered before customer started coming in. pick up hoses. Start pricing old plants that was pulled by vendors. Great workers and management in the plant area. Hardest part on the job was winding up the water hoses. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to talk and help customers.
good,"I enjoy working with my co workers, there has been so much change happening, that moral has went down. I am looking for less hours to be with grand kids."
good,My time at Lowe's taught me a lot of on hands job experience that will surely benefit me with future jobs. The management at Lowe's was amazing overall. Always there to lend a helping hand or answer questions for which i did not know the answer to.
good,"Great coworkers but low wages, hectic and inconsistent work schedules and inadequate employee coverage, made working here a nightmare for me (but not for everyone)."
good,"You have to learn fast, something new to learn everyday. Time goes very fast because of all the people coming in and out all week. There is always something to do everyday."
good,"Great place to work as long as you dont go above a specialist level. Management has un realistic expectatilns, and they don't care about work life balance. Great benefits people who work their are friendly and good work enviornment."
good,"Ok place to work.hours ok.management could use a bit of work.great associates always willing to help,but need to do more training and do more advancement."
good,I especially enjoyed working in the paint department.  There was fairly good flexibility in the scheduling.  I did some cashiering but that was my least favorite posistion...training was not adequate.
good,"I've been working there for the past three almost four years, I can honestly say it has been a great place to work in the past. The main benefit is the employees within the environment support each other past the point of you feeling like just an employee, you feel like a part of a very big family. "
good,"Like anywhere, it is only as good as the management you work under.  If you have great management, it will be a great environment.  But like most retail positions, there are times where hours are cut and employees are expected to pick up the slack for the lack of people scheduled."
good,"I worked for lowes for 1 year in the garden center. In that year i learned so much from them and customers. I even took advantage of one of the programs and got my forklift, cherry picker and stand-up forklift license! The benefits are really good to."
good,I had a great time working with this company. Everyone was nice and very helpful when in need of help. Good hours and always stayed busy. they would work with your schedule.
good,We go in and unload the material in the trailer truck and deliver it to the floor towards the end of the night. This was a second job for the most of us.The hardest part was moving double stack washer/dryers with a dolly. The most enjoyable was completing the task.
good,I have worked for Lowe's since 2003. I've enjoyed it very much. I have recently applied for 3 open full time positions in order to continue my tenure.
good,"overall Lowe's was a very good Company to work for, the only reason I left was because it started to become too difficult to manage two jobs at the same time"
good,A good places to grow and gain experience wanted to climb to ladder to coropate success. From being on the sales floor to management staff. you can gain great relationship with everyday customers.
good,"It was fun but, really hot in"
good,They give you the information you need to learn your job. On hands training with your coworkers. Safety is key to work there. They have workshops to help customers learn.
good,"good place to work, but they are changing a lot of things and  wasting money while doing it, some of the changes are not making since to the managers that are running the store, but do to upper management"
good,Lowe's is a nice place to work at. The staff is friendly and entertaining but do get their jobs done. Management is somewhat strict while nice at the same time. They make sure you do your job well.
good,"It was a good experience,  i worked part time and i will say it was perfect for the moment until i needed a little more money so i needed to find anither job."
good,"A typical day at work was , great, until some of the management made it stressful, I have learned alot of diversity, and business related skills , and developed great ideas of future expectations from lowes, the management was ok, I would say its not all , but some made the store look very unprofessional,  and was very rude, and disrespectful, and retaliated against some"
good,"Good company to be in while completing my education for my A.S. degree. Lowe's taught me numerous home improvement skills such as landscaping, hardware, and tools."
good,"employees are great people, good corporate structure. would recommend for any seasonal or full time work. "
good,Good work environment. There is availability to grow from within and continued advancement in the company. Lowes offers great benefits and everyone really embraces you.
good,"My job was mostly janitorial.  Typically I came to the store, worked "
good,"Almost short associate in all departments and specially evening shifts."
good,"Very busy during peak seasons. Most of the Managers have good intentions and want to do what's right for their employees, many do not know how to take care of their employees. Company has the right mindset, but may needs to review their top leadership and really contemplate what they want from their employees."
good,"Co-workers and management were amazing, but the customers can be so rude! Overall great experience working for Lowe's but I did get laid off without notice."
good,normal day at work i learned how to drive a forklift and all power equipment customer service receive my class a driver license through lowes meet a lot great people
good,"-Very physically taxing"
good,Working for Lowe's was at times very good and there were times when I wish I could have just walked out. The management staff are ok especially if you are cool with them or you kiss you know what. But as long as you come in and do what's expected of you then you will be good. You have a pretty good balance between work and home. There is room for advancement.
good,At lowes I have worked my way into management. As long as you try your best and aren't lazy then you won't have any issues. I really like it there and am happy that I may pretty good money for working retail.
good,"My overall working experience was great, but the favoritism was pretty real. Get in good with a manager and you are set, but if you tried to negotiate with them, it was game over."
good,"Fast paced but you learn different areas of what your title is.  If you're a people person, apply here!   Some great managers but some""talkers"".  You can move around also."
good,"It’s a good culture in the stores and honestly fun place to work, yet seems like people are starting to stress over the wrong things and makes working some days frustrating"
good,I would consider working at Lowes again if the opportunity arose. Lowes is a very fast paced company who really only considers that things need to get completed no matter how much extra time is needed to get it completed.
good,"Busy place to work at, always on the go, work hours change without them telling you at times. Pay is decent, vacation time is given, but health & dental insurance needs to be changed. All options are very expensive & doesn't cover alot. Vision ins is great. (For family of 4)"
good,"Loved working here, everyone was super nice and willing to lend a helping hand. They really seem to care about their employees and I would definitely recommend it."
good,"Pay is average or above, each day is spent stocking shelves with product or helping in other departments during busy times. Interacting with customers and helping them find product in the store. Supply trucks are not on a set schedule, so days are spent down stocking and organizing departments.Company awards store's with good safety records with a catered lunch."
good,"Lowe’s is a great company to work for.  The benefits for employees are great if you are okay working a sporadic schedule, which is typical for a retail job. Lowe’s will grow you in your career and help with advancement options if that’s the path you choose."
good,"steady paced job.and good people to work with.got forklift certified,good management,workplace culture was friendly,heavy lifting and alot of it.some of the people i worked with was good people"
good,"Alot of training issues. Must have self motivation and a willingness to "
good,Great part time job. Everyone was friendly to work with. Sometimes the work in my area was tough especially when someone bought an item and expected assembly on demand.
good,I enjoy working there.  The company is very good about providing training on an ongoing basis. There is always someone available to help you.  It is an excellent place for a college or high school student to have as an introduction to work/life.  It is also a good place for a retiree to work.
good,Days are busy and good positive customer service skills are a must. You must learn quickly where things are and be willing to help the customer. This is both the most enjoyable and the hardest part of the job.
good,"i work as a cashier only the weekends, the job is pretty easy but the hours of work they are a little crazy."
good,"It’s a good job for part-time college students. They’re very flexible if you’re going to school although the healthcare for part time is terrible. Do not recommend. Especially if you’re a cashier, yes it can get stressful but it can also be very laid back. Management could be better, but it’s decent. Overall it was a good place to work at."
good,I would have stated there longere but i fewl ill and had to move and relocated my whole life. Other than that it was a fun job i just with i had more time to learn more.
good,"A typical day at Lowe: You dont have a set schedule so depending on what time you get there, there's is a thing called power hour (10-2 on week days and 8-4 on weekends) and your only task is to go around looking for costomers and assist them. the other time while at Lowes, youre restocking product and making sure the department is clean. at the beginning of the day there's a thing called IRP that you have to complete and is basically just finding things on top stock and bringing them down because the holes are empty"
good,"There were a lot of good people there, but a couple of the managers tried to rule by intimadation.  People need managers that are uplifting and encouraging."
good,"Great place to work"
good,"I love working here, it has helped me learn how to socialize and talk to people better than before. I also learned a lot about how to use tools and such, the only con is that every day usually feels the same."
good,The company has changed over the past nine months I have been employed and it has changed for the better so far. A lot more exciting changes to come and its up to us managers to execute it.
good,I would always down stock items and help customers every day with the product making sure they feel happy and satisfied with the product that I’m selling to them.
good,Loved my job. An some off the people. Management made me take notes of everybody on shift an then would putt supervisor in middle of writing people up. I think if there was a strong supervisor there wouldn't hand been a reason on taking notes. Or maybe better workers. Idk. All around I enjoyed what I did. Great hours. 3days on an 4days off
good,"Working for Lowe’s as a Project Specialist for Interiors was the most rewarding job I’ve ever had"
good,"I would go back if I could,  though I'm having issues with my application.  If you can get in it's a good company. Try to transfer stores if you can instead of resigning and trying to reapply."
good,"Reviewing and reconciling sales, inventory and other reports as they relate to Key Performance Indicators for assigned department in order to maintain profitability, identify trends, define problems and develop and implement appropriate actions. -Stocking shelves to achieve in-stock and overhead organizational plans, maintaining aisle cleanliness, easyto shop and signage in coordination with internal partners -"
good,Poor management makes the job difficult and some what stressful.  The customer are the best part of the job. Never really a dull moment. The ones that’s been there for awhile are lazy.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's starts with a plan which can immediately be superseded by any number of crisis, from unexpected large truck deliveries to natural disasters. An employee at Lowe's must be prepared to be agile and willing to adapt to changes as they appear or occur and do so while smiling."
good,Lowes is a great place to work tbh. The only problem in my store is management and staff coverage. We're such a big store with not enough employees to cover all departments at all times.
good,Good place to work with great benefits and opportunity for growth. Focused on providing great customer service and fulfilling customer needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers.
good,"Call center isnt my thing, good place to work if that is an interest of yours. Management is caring, they work with you if you are open with them about your situations."
good,Management was always great and super helpful. But because it was a small store the delivery area had too high of expectations from corporate. Working in store however was much better about workloads.
good,Lowe's is a great place to work!! Staff is like family as well as customers. They try to work around your schedule. Always something new to do everyday!!
good,I was an assistant manager in several stores .Lowe's is typical of retail and I enjoyed my time there. I worked in several states and would go back to the company if possible. I for the most part always was treated well. I only left to move back to the east coast to be closer to family.
good,It is a nice place to meet new people and customer are nice people and the coworkers are fun to work with. There is some opportunity to move up in the company and some of the managers are nice
good,Lowe's has been a great employer for gaining career experience.   Managers work with team members hand in hand and coach on the job.  Willing to share their experience.
good,Working for this company allowed me to grow more than the previous company I had worked for. I was very thankful to have been guided by caring individuals that helped me refine my skills to what they are today. A great company to start with and move up in if someone is looking for that in their future.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's but left for other job opportunities. I have now relocated to Stillwater, OK and seeking a job close to me. The manager at the Mustang Lowes-Bobbie Aton was always supportive and a great manager to work for."
good,Very relaxed fun environment. Fast paced. Many different departments to work in while there. Unfortunately there are no real training classes that will train you if you want to move to a highly skilled area such as plumbing. Great place to network and meet lots of new people. Flexible work hours.
good,"Not a bad place to work, as a truck unloaded, the management worked with days off and things. Physical work, but keeps you in shape. Hours depend on when the job is done"
good,"I started at an entry level position and very quickly, through hard work and dedication, moved up multiple positions during my 13 years with the company. As long as you are willing to put in the effort to take care of your customers and your team the opportunities are there for advancement. Lowes has a great benefits and retirement program that makes them a great long term career company. The downside is the days off rotation and the time scheduled. Be aware that this is retail and your shifts will change from morning, to midday, to closing shifts all in one week and your days off can be inconsistent."
good,"Lowe's has been my life for 13 years, I have grown as an individual, learned great skills which will be useful throughout my life. Lowe's is a great place to network and experience all types of jobs."
good,Day at Lowes is put away stock get inventory down stocking done while helping customer. Until a certain time then it is customer focused in multiple departments
good,"Each Lowe's store has its own unique culture, mostly based on the management style of the Store Manager. The Store in Rolla, Mo, began with a very lack-luster culture that was catty, competitive, unfriendly, and given too strongly to cliques and favoritism. That changed with a new store manager that expected management to be active participants and for everyone, no matter how long they had worked at the store, to be held accountable. After a few months of chaos, the new culture at the Rolla Lowe's is still fast-passed, competitive, and sometimes stressful, but we were not longer competing against one another. Finally, that store became one team that works together to provide the best service they can. Departments were actually working together when I left, which was a major accomplishment. So long as nothing has changed, it is a great team to be a part of."
good,"While Lowe's does not offer me the amount of money that I need to provide for my basic living at this time, it does offer a considerable amount of financial stability that other entry level jobs wouldn't offer these days. The room for advancement is also excellent - there's no denying the ability to move forward within the company - so it doesn't feel like you're being stuck in one spot as long as you continue to work hard and learn."
good,"Hands off management for the most part, relaxed work environment but time management is a necessary skill for on the job. I had a lot of fun with my coworkers and found that most of them are easygoing and helpful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers as well as having to learn how to perform moderately difficult tasks around my department such as cutting glass and rekeying locks. My coworkers taught me almost everything I needed to know about my job, not my managers. The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers and learning a lot about Hardware and Tools."
good,It has it bad days but I loved working here the people are nice and really motivated me to do better it hard to come by a permanent position cause there always hiring seasonal but when u do it worth it
good,"I think Lowe's is a fun chill place I love shopping their and I loved working their,if their was a Lowe's where I lived I would apply again in a heart beat."
good,"I loved the fast paced work environment, but management was incredibly hard to engage with and corporate cares more about making more than Home Depot than they do about their employees or customers."
good,"Customer service is the backbone of the day to day. "
good,"Management varies significantly, good and bad."
good,Very friendly environment. Everyone was always willing to lend a helping hand. Worked front end cashier registers lots of helping hands. Fast paced store
good,This job provides a reasonable amount of training but does not become too excessive with it as most of what you need to know you will have to learn on the job. You get to communicate with a lot of people most of whom are a joy to help and work with though there are a decent amount who are just plain awful. You will regularly be put out of your comfort zone particularly for the first 6 months that you work there though this often leads to you gaining knowledge and skills.
good,"Always left on your on to figure out issues by management. Nobody was never available."
good,"I've worked for Lowe's for 11 years now as Sales Specialist for the Garden Center..I love my job and I help so many customers achieve a dream backyard. I help them with all their garden needs from fertilizers to sprinkler systems.I would like Lowe's to appreciate the work that I do..working outside in our Vegas heat feels like a pre-heated oven..loading block, rock, and soil bags takes a toll on our bodies and a simple pat on the back or a ""thankyou for all you do"" would be rewarding."
good,I enjoyed my time with lowes. met many great people along the way. I think the company could do a better job of giving employees more incentives. I saw many perks go away and nothing new given.
good,Lowe's is a great place to work especially if you are looking for a part time job then this is a great option for you but if you want hours then you may not like working for lowes.
good,Good company to work for only complaint is the training you receive isn't the best and the management can be pretty bad especially on the overnight shift.
good,"A typical day at work was slow paced. We just keep inventory stocked, clean our work areas, help customers and provide advice when asked. The Management was not bad and I feel everyone gets along well."
good,"Fast pace,always busy lots to get done never a dull moment great people to work with most of the time,TV in break room you are always helping solve problems managers come and go and get moved around around every 6 mo."
good,"Worked here when i moved to Georgia. it was a good job set hours, for receiving. The environment is not geared towards  customer satisfaction as much as home depot is (i worked for both)."
good,"Never dull, always something new. hours reasonable, Break and lunch times were good. training programs are good. always someone to ask for information. Occasional awards for outstanding service. Management is changing operational policies often without notice. Break room is good place, clean and quiet. Lockers provided for employees personal items and coat rack as well. schedules are varied and flexible,"
good,Good company teaches you great skills and do a great job at celebrating achievements. Varity of customers which gives you different experience everyday.
good,"A day at work which you begin with your daily safety review, and review areas of needing replenishment. Status with department team and management of the day to obtain any new responsibility for day."
good,"High paced. High expectation job. Just depends on the store you go to and the management there. Ask questions, and know expectations before you jump into a position."
good,"As a stocker for Outside Lawn & Garden, it was a satisfying challenge being responsible for what was essentially a sub-department. Due to the work, I was regularly unsupervised and it allowed me to organize and stock how I wanted. Since I was the sole stocker for what I stocked, this meant that the system in place (with overstocked pallets outside and in topstock, placement of items in their homes), I did not experience unnecessary meddling by management or fellow associates, who all understood that I worked well, quick, and hard and kept the department organized and properly stocked at all times."
good,Management was too quick to pua lot of work on a new person. I was required to do five pallets a day within a six hour window and I still didn't have much of a handle on the stocking part of my job. When I was hired I was in outside lawn and garden and then they switched me to stocking and that's when my happiness with my job decreased.
good,"I worked in a distribution center and all around it was a pretty decent place to work. Decent pay, Decent benefits, 4 days on 3 days off for day shift and 3 days on 4 days off for weekend shift. 10-12 hr shifts. Was a lot like being back in high school though. Everyone had their own little clicks of people they would hangout with which made it kind of hard to make friends with a lot of people. The hourly pay could have been better but it wasn't terrible."
good,"A collaborative work pace in a generally good, local culture. It's a good place to work overall. Through working  at Lowe's, I got a better understanding on many aspects of DIY home repair options and techniques."
good,"A good place to work. Pays fairly well and provides training and many helpful programs for work based experience. Very political in selection of advancement, which makes the management term biased and often seemingly encumbered due to lack of knowledge or experience in particularly selected supervisory positions."
good,"It's a retail position. There's not much else to say about it. They pay is okay for retail, pretty standard. Not many people take their job too seriously. It's pretty fun some times"
good,"a day at work for, i get there and clock in and get my things together, then i go down to the reviving bays and begin to unload  truck. putting everything that comes off onto skids. After the truck is completed we take all the skids to their appropriate departments. After that is done i go home."
good,Very fast paced atmosphere.  Store management and job descriptions need more attention. My co-workers were my best part of the job.  Getting management to address/resolve problems is very difficult.
good,"I think that lowes is a great place to work. The reason i think this is because you have a lot of benefits to working at this company. For instance you have 401K, you have stocks and bonds. Also other perks to working at lowes is that if you are a student and you need to go off to college you can always transfer to another lowes because there are a wide variety of this company in the US."
good,I really enjoyed my job while working here.  Management engages employees.  Staffing from other areas work together to satisfy customer needs. Extensive training provided.
good,I enjoy what I do with lowes.  Everyday offers new and exciting challenges to work with.  I haved learned a lot in my time with this company.  I have had a lot of success.
good,"I learned that a bag of concrete is heavier than it looks, that the more respectful you are to your employees, the harder they work. And I learned that If you do your job and keep a smile on your face, no job is a bad job."
good,It’s a good job with great benefits. a normal day is working with your teams to merchandise your stores. I spork with storer managers to make sure the bus tore is m=erchandised to meet company needs.
good,"I enjoyed working here. I enjoyed my supervisor as well. As far as I know, the store manager doesn't listen to what his team says though. I worked overnights so it was quiet but we were locked in the store until the next shift showed up."
good,Great place to work part-time while in school. Management was willing to work with me to grow with the company. They even recognized the work I put in and what I brought to the company.
good,"My experience at l Lowe's wasn't bad , but the certainly didn't attempt to retain me after relocating to a new store. I was there for quite a while and worked in two different departments. Seemed like I had a lot of experience to let walk"
good,Overall I found working for Lowes to be a positive experience and felt that it was mutually beneficial.  I wish they were more employee friendly and rewarding to those deserving.
good,The environment was a very warm and welcoming one. Every employee felt like they mattered. The managers cared and compensated. Overall a good place to work.
good,Lowes has been a great place for me to work. The hours fit my schedule. I enjoy creating rests that bring  fresh and clean product placement to improve customers shopping experience.
good,"Good so far, i liked working there. people are good so far nice environment. very stressful but also good if you get a hang of it. i enjoyed it to be honest."
good,After management change half of longtime employees left to go with exiting manager due to  past problems with this one.  Store was in a turmoil. It's a family again.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers, very flexible with time off request.  I just didn’t care for those customers that felt a sense of entitlement and were given it so they wouldn’t call corporate."
good,I love working at Lowe's I recommend it 100% to anyone looking for a job. There is great people who work here and it fun major of the time. Sometimes stressful depending on how much you actually know about your role in the company.
good,Lowe’s was a decent place to work with a fast paced and challenging workload with excellent management as well as excellent employees and chances for advancement
good,"Great work Environment, and has good health benefits. Learned that team work is very important and have excellent communication between co-workers and management."
good,Normal day would be getting to work and going straight to work. Most the time the people i worked with would be angry for no reason so it made the shift really complicated at times. At the start we would have to prepare ourselves by getting what we needed to complete our tasks. We would run into many problems and issues while in the middle of our work so we would have to really think about what we should do to fix the problem. The hardest parts would be getting to work and not knowing what problems we were going to have that day. It was always unpredictable and issues happened unexpectedly. I really enjoyed being able to learn more about the items that were in the store. I learned better listening skills and communication skills.
good,"The people I worked with were excellent. Walked the store about 5 times a day to check out what was going on in different departments."
good,"really great workplace to work just poor management, i really can not disagree with services and workers are great workers to work around. when its comes to recognition non is hardly giving and sometimes the work environment can become a bit harsh if you working on building materials department"
good,"I found that working for Lowe's has been demanding and at many times hard. But the people, culture and management made it worth it. The store is filled with caring people and have a wonderful management team willing to do what is best for their people and will accommodate you as much as they are able to to help you provide yourself with a brighter future even if it isn't with the company itself. They care so much about their people."
good,"I loved working at Lowe's and would go back if the pay was comparable to what I am making now."
good,"Not a bad job competitive pay, scheduling my shifts was the issue on why I put my 2 weeks in. Was a good worker professional and great customer service skills on the road and in the store. Also I hardly ever took a lunch or a break but I didn’t mind. Went to reapply at Lowe’s and they said they would take me back in a heartbeat but never took me back. So that’s that I guess"
good,Great job while it lasted. The problem is under staffed and mangment has to many favorites. My job is very stressful it is changing really quick with alot of walmart staff who has no idea about lowes besides retail
good,There aren’t many advancement opportunities but it is a great place to work as a beginner in retail. Easygoing is environment depending on who the manager is and there are easy to get along with coworkers that make the job more enjoyable
good,"Completing scheduling for 12+ cashiers, managed front end and counted daily tills and safe checking for shortages and locating them if possible. Supplies change to all cashiers as well as assisted with any and all customer assistance needed. Making sure all customers were completely satisfied prior to leaving store."
good,Lowe's is always busy. Time goes fast when you're busy. It's easy to look up product info when a UPC is missing. Standing on the concrete all day hurts the body.
good,"Easy and flexible hours. The environment was always good to be around. The customers could be rude, but it was never extreme issues. The employers never gave me problems."
good,The pay and benefits were great! I absolutely loved most of the employees I worked with and there were a few really great managers but the overall big wigs sucked!
good,if you like to work a heavy load alone. I don't have a lot to say about the company. you have terrible hours and the pay is good. the work load is heavy
good,I worked in the lumber section of lowes as a seasonal employee. I liked it and learned a lot. But I needed more money so I left. good job for a college kid
good,I received products and loaded the truck. I was working in shipping and receiving areas. look on computers to see what products u have.. We work together.
good,"Sometimes fast paced based on customers in store. Working window coverings somewhat frustrating as most customers walk in without a plan but want their shades right away. "
good,"I actually love working at Lowes, majority of the staff is very friendly and management is nice and listens to you. I would reccomend to anyone that likes working in retail."
good,"A fast paced retail job with hours that would change every week. I believe with the corporate changes came uncertainty and it was time to move on. Great job as far as retail goes, though"
good,"I worked as a commercial loader. You pretty much help people out the door with their purchases. This included using forklifts and tying down/strapping the load when necessary."
good,"Lowe's is a solid performer when it comes to retail businesses. Their scheduling is a little odd with a rotating shift and days off but once you get used to it, its not bad. It does require you to be on your feet all day and constantly moving."
good,"I was in mgtmt position so it was very stressful. You are responsible for everything within your department. Having to assign people to tasks and they don't get the job done , at the end of the day it all falls on your shoulders.  Ving responsible for sales gross profit shrinks it's a difficult job."
good,Taking work from other drivers was challenging. Some of them didn't want to work inside due to pay cut. Communication by some managers were conflicting and hours of work was stressful for some drivers. I love the work but work stress caused me to move on.
good,In retail the only thing that is constant is change.  The PSE position is the best as it provides flexibility and a nice income.  Management is behind the program but there are limits to what they are willing to do.
good,A typical day at the workplace was pretty laid back expect on weekends those were the busiest days. but i learned a good amount of information working there.
good,"Worked as a CSA for about three years in plumbing and hardware depts. Was part time starting on closing shift 3 - 11 pm. Work was fast paced but enjoyed working with customers. Had to stock shelves and help customers locate items as well as give advice on their products."
good,Easy hire process.  Management should put more focus on training and providing employees with skills to better themselves not just on the job but in every day life skills.  As a service member with 30 years experience on people skills you always wanted to set the example.  Regretfully I did not see that from management.
good,"Normally, I felt that the customer satisfaction was the main concern of co-workers and most management. Some safety issues would not be addressed with equipment that needed repair."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes in Texas, had great management. They never asked twice when I needed help or had questions. You could always find them helping their teams. For the most part all the employees were happy and seemed to enjoy their jobs. We all made it a fun work place!!!!"
good,i loved working at lowes but as soon as i started college they would start scheduling me during my class hour and i would be unable to work because at the time college came first.
good,"great co workers,learned alot, got certafied on a picker, very challenging work but fun, pulled frieght out to put on shelves, down stocked product, management was kinda of absent sinceit was overnight,"
good,the company is going through a lot of changes right now and they seem to be for the better but still so far behind in technology and the work/ life balance of managers is going to get worse as they have the opinion you make enough money if they want you to do more you do it and with HR managers going away in July more is falling on the store manager and Assistant Store managers plate
good,"Pretty much at the end of my tenure at Lowe's, the department ran their end without a manager because he had to run another department (stock) and couldn't help with delivery (he was overwhelmed)."
good,A fast pace retail store that allows you to meet and work with different people. It gives you the opportunity to learn about home improvement where tools can be applied in your own time
good,Lowes is a good place to work in some aspect. You meet a lot of different people and work with a big diversity of people. The best part about working at Lowes was that your coworkers were became like a second family.
good,"Was recruted to work there. As time passed by some of the managers were out of control. Coworkers were great."
good,"This is a part-time job that I work at on the weekends"
good,Lowes was a job that I would be there more than home. Coworkers would say I lived there. Overall it’s a good job and will help you however you need to be helped.
good,"Fun people makes the places alright, but if it's a boring day, itll last about 16 hours. Customers generally ask the same questions. Nice, friendly environment."
good,"Would encourage anyone looking to join to really understand the mission, vision and culture of the organization.  It's retail and big box and the customer demands are changing so quickly, this business needs to remain relevant or risk falling out of favor with the consumer."
good,Fun job to work at. Great place for college students or first job. Nothing to stressful about the job unless you can't handle busy times. Staff was all friendly and easy to work with.
good,First actual job and I learned a lot working there and using what I learned in the real world. I learned a lot about working with others and making sure the customer ends up satisfied at the end of the day
good,A typical work day at Lowe's you are constantly running from one end of the store to the other covering breaks. I learned how to handle other workers mistakes and correct it to make customers happy. The management is fairly decent you hardly see them or get to talk to them when it is needed most.
good,"This company is good to work for, typical retail job. You never know if you have a job the next day according to what corporate is doing. They need job sensitivity training to see what each department/position has to deal with on a daily basis. Other than that I have no negative things to say about them. They put food on my table to take care of my family."
good,Could be better structured for time away. Days worked could be better with more set schedules. Lowes is good for moving up but several jobs seem to being cut away.
good,"I was very nervous at first being an older employee getting back into the work place. However, after making new friends and letting my guard down, it all became easy. I felt more comfortable with the staff. I am a natural when it comes to working with customers so I knew that part of the job would be easy."
good,Very knowledgeable and very fast paced. Great environment with associates and customers. The hardest part of the job was closing the store as the only associate in my department. I enjoyed doing customer service the most but also love the knowledge I've gain in the time I was there.
good,I enjoy working for Lowe's Home Improvement Company.  There are many avenues to pursue.  Fellow associates are extremely helpful and pleasant to work with on daily tasks.
good,My position is as a commissioned outside sales specialist.  It is unique.  I would recommend it.  Most positions are hourly retail positions and I cant comment on them.
good,This company is so understanding and helps its employees during hard situations. There is room for expansion within the company. I learned that team work is important and essential.
good,"meeting with client to discuss their kitchen and or bathroom remodel ideas, design and planning and offering full installation services through a General Contractor"
good,"It was fun, helping customers love where they live I was awarded often for sales goals and customer compliments. As well as loss prevention awards. It was a warehouse atmosphere constant work pricing downstocking frontfacing unloading trucks making sure your department was clean..etc"
good,Lowe’s is a great company to work for! They are constantly growing and looking to promote. It is a fast paced environment and very competitive. I recommend this job.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work for the most part. There are a few times a year that hours get cut. There are some amazing people that work for the company, some of them I am now great friends with!"
good,The work becomes monotonous but that could be overlooked if the raises came more frequently. In nearly 2 years of working there I received only 1 .25 raise.
good,"Got let go due to attendance issues (2 months after my father passed away from cancer). I don't hate them, but wish they would have been a little more understanding due to the circumstances."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, relaxed management while being supportive. I didn't enjoy the flip flop schedule. It makes having a work/home life difficult."
good,"Lowe's was a pretty good experience for the most part. They don't spend much time training you. Customers get mad when you're not familiar with all departments of the store, or when you can't fit them into deliveries or make a product magically appear."
good,My job is not hard although it is very hard for advancment in this company.   I completed my college degree and still no advancement or pay increases!
good,I find Lowe's a great place to work.  I enjoy waiting on customers and helping them with issues.  They are easy to work with as far as scheduling around my full time job.
good,"The experience varied, due to management changes, with personalities. The staff in charge of shifts needs more effective methods. Placing employees, in different sectors without proper Safety methods, and skills needs to be more efficient."
good,"fun place to work, nice environment and room for advancement. faced pace environment, challenging, and fair. worked with many great people always willing to give a helping hand. I defiantly would go back."
good,Besides being in your department. You have to downstock items and also we have to do IRP’s which counts inventory. And we have to do this everyday especially if you open.
good,Depending on who your manager is and who else works in your department your job typical day can either be a breeze or a nightmare. Management at times seem out of touch with what is really goingon at the store.
good,Good part time and full time job. Good for gaining more customer service experience. The employees you work with are really easy to work with and build relationships with.
good,"Great place for advancement, loved operating the equipment, very physical and fast paced, management team could be better, difficult doing some tasks without help which was sometimes hard to find"
good,"I only worked part time, but it was nice for the amount of time I was there. Management could use some work for the store I was at, they weren't all the helpful or seemed like they wanted to help. Coworkers were always pretty friendly. Hardest part of the job was the customers being rude and being understaffed as I was a front desk/customer service worker so the front always seemed overly busy."
good,"Started work at 5:00 am, Monday to Friday in the position of Product Service Associate at the Lowes Home Improvement store in Antioch, Tennessee."
good,I really enjoyed working at Lowe's. I was treated as a valued member of the team and trained extensively for the position offered to better assist customers.
good,Working at Lowes reminded me how to be active. I was constantly multitasking many requests at one time to ensure the customers received the proper service.
good,"Great place to work. Excellent stepping stone into career. Great benefits for students, military, and upcoming tradesmen. Room for growth in the training sector and store level management selection."
good,"I worked the lumber center and the inside/outside garden center."
good,i enjoy working in my position it gives me a sense of  accomplishment.. i have monday thru friday set schedule which means a lot to me. the job is heavy and requires working outside in all conditions
good,Well thought out expectations for each employee. The nicer retail version of Home Depot. Strong focus on following corporate direction. Typically high turnover rate.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowe’s. The co-workers, and management were very nice and understanding. They were willing to work around my schooling schedule, and very considerate when it came to family problems."
good,typical day was to unload 3 to 6 trucks and verify product to be redistributed in the facility.for the most part management was okay to work for. most of them appreciated the effort that you had to put in to get the job done.fellow employees were good to work with.
good,"If you have customer service experience in a call center environment with a positive attitude to boot, this is a good place for you. There is a good amount of advancement opportunity depending on you r level of work experience or current department. You pretty much get back what you give with this company as far as Job security goes.."
good,"not a bad place to work at all but I only work part time, and lots of times you work more than one department because of lackof coverage in other departments"
good,"Lowe's has been a great company to work for thus far.  I have been there for years and have (like any retailer) endured a lot of change.  Most recently things are changing drastically with a new CEO and upper echelon of management.  This is good and bad as you are either compatible or not.  Those who are good at adapting to anything will be just fine.  Those who aren't might as well start looking elsewhere.  Much change is to come with this company, the results of which are yet to be known."
good,"managers work with you, but Kronos work space (things you clock in and out with) is very confusing and goes down a lot and schedule is slightly confusing."
good,"Lowes was only meant to be a PT.  I had a FT as well.  Lowes was a mental relief for me and a physical workout as well."
good,"This was my first job, so it was decent to start with. It was messy and i lost clothes because i worked in the paint department. My coworkers were decent except one of my managers."
good,"Lowes keeps you very busy with many many tasks. Its your job to provide excellent customer service, maintain your department can be overwhelming at times but its a great place to learn and good pay and benefits for the most part."
good,Co-workers are great to be around and make work a fun place. Managers are easy to approach and are willing to help. Training is taken serious and they make sure you are comfortable before they send out off on your own.
good,"- Fast Paced"
good,"Great opportunity to work autonomously while still staying within the guidelines provided  by corporate.  Always busy as a Store Manager, must be visible for your team and customers."
good,"It's a typical retail job, doesn't matter what company you work for certain things will always be the same.  The company is taking a different direction and will continue to grow"
good,It is a good job to have for the summer. Helps work on people skills and geting you more in tune with the working world. Good teacher for patience. Would recommend for a first or second job.
good,"This company pays well, but as a cashier you'll be paid for standing. There's very little for cashiers to do, but again, the pay is pretty great and depends on your experience."
good,Lowe’s is a great place to work with a laid back atmosphere and friendly staff. It’s not a great place to work if your wanting full time hours. The pay is average for the area.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to learn and grow in the home improvement industry.  A typical day starts with a safety walk, followed by a morning of filling shelf quantity.  The company is driven by customer expectations and does not allow tasking during hours of peek customer traffic.  The company does allow for paid breaks within the guidelines, and also lunch time."
good,"Everyone welcomed me when I got hired. Good place to work. I would do it again if they let me. When I started and found out how much computer work there was, I wasn't sure I could do it but, they had patience with me and taught me until I mastered my computer responsibilities."
good,"Overall, a very good company with a lot of potential career growth.  The Mooresville campus is a modern facility with many amenities on campus ranging from a CVS Pharmacy to a gym to multiple food options.  The culture is evolving with the recent changes in the executive team but remains positive and collaborative.  I would expect things to continue to improve with the new team."
good,Learn lots of useful things for life here. Management is well-rounded and helpful. Coworkers and customer base always pleasant and appreciative of your help.
good,The culture at Lowe's Home Improvement seemed very lay back.  They allowed you to assess the needs and ask manager if you could work on those assessed needs.    The manager would usually give you direction and then allowed you to work on the assess needs you saw.   They meet daily in morning as team and I really like this as got to know the overall situation of the store as most worked in specific areas.
good,"I went to work for Lowes with the promise of being entered in to a management training program. I was working in the flooring department and enjoyed my job. However every time I brought up"
good,"Great company to work for, with different opportunities to move to a different section within the store. It's a pretty easy job with a calm environment."
good,"•       Worked in Kanban methodology and Agile with Scrum Process for the development of the product."
good,lowes is a good place to work for they staff is friendly. It can be stressful at time and and you can be pulled from different departments at times but for the most part it is a fun job.
good,There needs to be more responsibility set on the employees from direct managers. Some people get away with everything because they are not kept up with.
good,"I love my Lowes family. However, the hours are crazy. Only one weekend off a month. And the week is filled with both  opening and closing shifts. Most of us would prefer a more set schedule."
good,"Project Management for up to 7 store's kitchen and bath projects dealing with multiple contractors. In addition, required answering non project, Core Calls, from customers dealing with purchase issues or scheduling. At times managers can vary in their answers regarding policy issues with customers. Lowes Stores do not seem willing to grasp the polices of the Central Production Office when it comes to dealing with projects or scheduling. Computer Programs don't seem to inter-relate to each other a great deal of the time."
good,"I work at Lowe's millwork, which is a totally different beast than a store. Lowe's itself has taken very good care of me over the years. Great pay, great benefits, job security. It's the millwork that is a mess. The management stresses safety, but scoffs at any changes that might cost money."
good,its a great place to work but watch out for management especially when it comes to be your time to move up. All in all a good place to work but be ready to work
good,"Somewhat higher stress atmosphere at times. You need to be a critical thinker and quick decision maker if you want to make it in this department. No sales numbers to hit, no commission, but hours are great (7-4, 8-5,, 9-6, one Saturday a month)."
good,"I completed my work placement at Lowes in Fairfield. duties that I have completed includes. stock take. removing and adding tags on to clothing, folding clothing, cleaning up the store."
good,"Environnement de travail productif et agréable. Au moment de mon départ, l'entreprise déployait beaucoup d'efforts à instaurer une nouvelle culture d'entreprise. Je leur souhaite du succès ayant passé de nombreuses bonnes années avec cette entreprise."
good,"It was an okay place to work. They pay wasn't very good, for what my job responsibilities were. The management was very good and taking care of the staff and giving us the flexibility we needed concerning our work schedule."
good,Was relaxed inviroment. The only thing is they require you to be up on your a game when it came to compuer skills. Seems the peple who are full time are there for life.
good,"Gained alot of knowledge , and skills for the 7 years employeed at Lowes.. Learned great customer service, ability to be a team player , and ability to work alone, with attention to dtail.."
good,"You know that when you get into the big box stores that there will be issues. However, Lowe's seems to be a little better than others. Overall a good place to work"
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes. They are friendly and easy to work with. It is a great team but I needed more hours and benefits. It was a great environment to work in.
good,"Lowe's is good place to work, you get many benefits as an employee. Also, lunch breaks are fair and (where I work) there are employees who always try to make it a fun place to work."
good,"I worked in a fairly busy Lowe's but it was good, made good friends with the people I worked with. Everyone helped each other if they needed it. But every Lowe's is different."
good,I was a seasonal employee in the internet department. They got rid of me at the end of the season after not putting me on the schedule with no notice. I was being paid less than my coworkers in the same seasonal position. Worked under a department manager and assistant manager I almost never saw. Forklift certification training was never provided despite how easy I was told the process is. As a picker/packer there was relative freedom to operate without supervision. It was nice while it lasted. Wish I could've kept working there with a promotion to permanent staff and a raise.
good,"I contracted here for about 4 months in Talent Acquisition. The team was ok, but of course there was 1 person that thought she knew everything and she was very loud.  The facility is beautiful but I feel like they are flexible. They aren't really open to remote working which is crazy to hear if you work in Talent/Recruiting. The Talent Manager is cool but her team is way to big so its not fair to her. The compensation map that we follow is 30% under be competitive."
good,Lowe's focus a lot on safety and is very strict about the amount of work that you get done in a day. You are pushed to do as much as you can but you have to be completely safe about it.
good,Good place to work if you like having a good workout. Managers aren't always available to help you. Early mornings and long days. Good staff and friendly supervisors.
good,"Overall Lowe's is a good company to work for, Their pay is competitive and they are fair in the hiring process. If you have a positive attitude and have initiative you will stand out and be rewarded and recognized for it. It is tough hard work at the end of the day and a lot of moving pieces with not a lot of supervision overall culture is provide customer service and make sure product is available for customers. If you have that drive and can handle the work load Lowe's is a good fit."
good,"As a CDL truck driver I was out of the store most of the time."
good,Lowe's has given me the opportunity to grow as an Cabinet Specialist. I love what I do and do not wish to change my career choice as a Cabinet Specialist. It is difficult to relocate to another store.
good,"Good company to work for, not too many complaints, must be prepared for labor, management works 50 plus hours a week, salary is competitive depending on region"
good,Work place that cares about it's employees.  Very boring at times.  Monthly homemade meals brought in.  If you make any mistakes they will not keep you.
good,"A typical day at work could be stressful. If you were okay working at a cubicle and did not mind assisting customers over the phone with purchases from the Lowe's website or through the store, This would possible be the job for you."
good,Most coworkers were friendly though a few were prone to rumor spreading or gossiping. It was a good place for a college student to work but had little chance of career advancement. A good summer job or short term job.
good,"My day starts at 6:30 AM going over my schedule and making sure I have everything I need for sales appointments. I run about four appointments a day all within about a hour from the store. When my appointments are complete I go back to the store to turn in my paperwork, order materials, email CPO, and installers with jobs sold, check on received materials and notify CPO that products are here and ready to ship to job sites. I make some follow up calls and then print materials I will need for appointments the next day. I walk the floor talking to employees to make sure they know how to and are gathering leads."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work, they have ""competitive pay"" but I've never seen it. Managers pick and choose who gets promoted. I get paid way less than what I do for the store but that doesn't my work ethic. If your department doesn't make sales they get on your a**."
good,"I had a part-time seasonal position here for most of a year, and really enjoyed the flexibility. They were very understanding about my class hours, and the pay wasn't bad."
good,"Worked as a seasonal employee. At times they had more people then they needed so would end up sending people home, other times we were short staffed. People would call out and they would not replace them so we would work short. Head cashiers would often try to cover."
good,"If you're into having something to do they have work for days if you're into it. "
good,"Great place to work at, did so for 11+ years. Structural changes caused a lot of turmoil. New CEO getting things back in line but not at the pace I would like. Great place to advance with various job types. Hardest part of my job is relying on a third party delivery service to fulfill the customer's needs and not cause damage to our product. Most enjoyable part the job is being a supplier of the community for recreation and building supplies. A typical week at work is being paid for 40 hours and working 55+."
good,90% needed for the month system is broken. Can work hard and score a 75% if your task scores bad. Bascially have to cheat the system. If your score isnt up to standerd you lose your job. No one knows how things are actually scored. If this was fixed to score proper the job wouldnt be bad at all. Oh and dont get caught cheating eaither.
good,"-Clock in"
good,"lowes is like any customer service job: good and bad managers, good and lazy coworkers, great and horrible customers. i was fortunate enough to have a good manager and coworkers in my area but, again, just a customer service job. it will be what you make of it."
good,"Fast paced, hard work. Diverse skill set required. Right CEO in place currently. Expect big changes and not settling for less than best. Aggressive Appliances."
good,"Lowes employees are like family.  Your experience is directly related to the quality of your management team.  The Customers can be grumpy, probably 1/3 of them are there to fix an emergency repair problem and may have no idea how. The hardest part of the job is standing on those concrete floors all day long,  The most rewarding is helping someone fix there problem or helping them with their dream project."
good,the typical of job dealing with customer. I learned how to be patient and interacts with new people. management is very involve with the floor work. workplace culture is very good. no it not a hard place to work. help people around me.
good,"Lowe's is overall a good place to work, depending on management. If your particular store has management that cares about their employees as much as the bottom line then you will enjoy working there. If looking for part-time work it is great, they have several different positions that can fit your schedule and the compensation is decent for a part-time job. If going full-time I recommend management positions only, as the compensation for full-time work doesn't match other warehouse/factory or trade jobs in the area."
good,Management didn't communicate well between each other. Our store was like a second family. Hardest part is when I had to correct other peoples's mistakes.
good,Environment is relaxed but at some point almost so relaxed you become bored. The days are pretty routine and fellow co-workers are generally nice and enjoyable to be around.
good,It was a comfortable place to work I loved all the people there management was great and they were flexible with hours and days off overall a great company to work for
good,"Cashier, Customer service, Learned alot about home store."
good,Positive experience and look up to my supervisors as excellent mentors.  Employees very family orientated. Willing to train in all areas.  Learned to understand plumping in laymens' terms and enjoyed interacting and helping customers in paint.  Moved to other areas when staffing was low.
good,The associates that i worked with at Lowes were great people to be around. The environment however was stressful and wasn't very challenging. Management was slightly stressful and i felt as though i could have been doing more there.
good,Management are terrible. They use there workers to get their job done then make it seem like you don't work. Not all mangers. Some are great. A slim few though.
good,"overall good experience with lowes however once i got into an exterior sales position, the good ole boy mentality set in really hard. i enjoyed my time there was good overall"
good,"Work was menial, repetitive, and exhausting, but they made up for it in the quality of their employees. The coworkers were great, probably my favorite team of people at a workplace. Everyone was friendly and kind and helpful. Management slacked though, every time you need a manager there's never one to be found."
good,Company has good benefits and you meet new people all the time. I enjoyed meeting people from the surrounding areas and the teamwork atmosphere. Enjoyed cross training over the years.
good,"It's a good starting point and if you're younger, you'll probably go far. Just don't count on it if you're older like I am.  And if you're female and have any previous experience, don't count on being given the benefit of knowing a thing."
good,"Lowes was the perfect place to work during college. they worked around my classes without problem. The management is fair for the most part the only negative is the positions arent always full, so you have to cover several roles."
good,"I enjoyed working weekends at Lowe's. The manager, co-workers, and customers were friendly. The drive was long from where I lived. My city did not have a Lowe's at that time."
good,i delivered and installed major appliances. i learned to to install major appliances and how to remove and put appliances in a safe manner. i also learned some useful tools to do so and tricks of the trade of how to disassemble and reassembly appliances
good,I enjoyed my time at Lowes and would go back.  Hrs are ok but it is retail so expected to work at least 2 nights a week and 2 to 3 weekends a month depending on position.  The store I was at had 2 good managers and 2 that were really not warranted for the positions they were in. Store manager was great.  A bit of a Micro manager but personality was awesome.
good,"Lowes is an extremely open environment and has great customers with experiences all over. Do not hesitate to ask for help, you will learn new things from employees that has been there for a while."
good,I haven't had too many problems with this employer. I get paid too high for what I do. Its sad that I make more hourly than an educational professional.
good,"With proper management it's a great place to work. Lack of home life, but that's retail. Great team when motivated. Decent pay, demanding hours sometimes inconsistent with plans."
good,"The training is difficult to go through. I still am not entirely sure what I should be doing, but I'm learning slowly. It's nice when you can get help from coworkers, but we're really short staffed right now. So it's all hands on deck, and sometimes you are left alone to figure out how to help a customer. Other than that, the job is fairly simple. In the paint department, you mix the pain, and you make sure the aisles are stocked and look nice."
good,"Typical day: keeps me busy, but tired at the end of my shift"
good,Great fellow employees and some decent managers. The public interaction was stressful at times and other times enjoyable.  The hours were inconsistent.
good,"Lowes is a well run company and local managers have been mostly good. The benefits are good overall but expensive coupes and families. The hourly salary is low, and they are constantly cutting hours as a way of controlling costs. We got a one-time bonus after the recent big tax-cut but no hourly salary increase. If they really want to help employees and increase productivity a salary increase would be helpful and appreciated."
good,The typical day at work consisted of assisting customers. Follow up to vendors. Tasking. dealing with issues. I learned that u do a lot of work for little reward. Don't get paid enough to deal with amount of issues that come up. The hardest part about the job is getting everything a customer asks for. The most enjoyable part is the people you work with.
good,"I worked at Lowe's for all of my college years, they were very flexible on shifts and when I could work with school. Very little advancement opportunities in my personal experience, but I was a cashier for a good amount of my time there. I did everything, any time a department needed coverage I was the first person they pulled to place there for the time needed. Although I do thing that is what was the downfall of my time at Lowe's. I was their personal jack of all trades and they could put me anywhere for days to weeks at a time but pay me the same I would be as a cashier. Every chance I got for advancement was shut down by either someone else who applied for it or outside of the store. There was one point that a job posting was actually taken down and re-posted after I had applied to the listing. They claimed that there was not enough applicants for it, they needed three, I, one, I'm sure there were more than two others who had applied."
good,"It's a great place to work just some managers aren't fair , any age can work here and gender , great for college students , it's pay you good if you work harder."
good,The job is okay but i feel as if the management could work on communication a little . Team work is very important in an atmosphere like lowes. Very fast paced
good,Cookouts yearly and yearly functions is a great place to work and meet customers.  Learn more stuff everyday and can advance as you like for other departments.
good,"Decent benefits, however the medical could be improved.  Hours are decent, consistent days off.  My location has many employees with 15+ years which is hard to find in retail.  "
good,"Lowes has really worked with me, as I was in school working towards my bachelors degree. By placing me in the position in which it allowed me to attend school during the day and work night shifts. This is a place I would highly recommend."
good,-Opportunity to grow
good,Lowes was a great company to work for it can get busy at times during the holiday seasons. I have learned different departments within the store.The workplace culture was good. The most enjoyable part is working closely with the public.
good,I've enjoyed my time at Lowe's. You definitely get out what you put into it. Positives- You put the work in you can advance as far as you'd like. Lowe's management is filled with people who started out as cashiers and or loaders. Negative- Work/Life balance.
good,"Freedom and ability to work as long as you would like made this a fantastic work environment for me. Typical day started with loading the trucks with the appliances scheduled to be delivered that day. Then, 1-3 people would drive to residential homes to unload, and install their appliances. After removal of old appliance we would then proceed to the next destination. When the truck was empty, and depending on time of day, we then had a choice to reload the truck for another round or go home."
good,"Lowes is a good company, they at least try to treat their employees as humans. All of the issues stem from the same issue for all retail, houres quota, too many people who are just there to get a paycheck and go home, and a lack of specific training for each department. But the job pays well and the people, in general, are good folks. Would say if you know about basic home improvement and are willing to work retail to give it a shot."
good,"Unloaded Trailers, filled with Merchandise on to a belt, then onto a pallet desinated for that department, once filled pulled pallet to that department., Set for Stockers. Repeated until truck was empty, cleaned work area for Recieving. "
good,"Pay is good starting out, but it is hard to advance in the company. There is also a total lack of training. You are very much trained on a few computer modules but learn nothing about the department you are in."
good,you have more than one job. make the day go by faster for sure. management was there to help when needed. always something to do. good work family to be around everyday.
good,A typical day at Lowes is a self motivating start. depending on the day you could be completely overwhelmed with customers or very slow. I did learn more about doors and windows. hardest part of the job is having the self discipline to not get mad at a customer.
good,"I liked working here. The delivery team was fun to be with and everyone did their fair share when we were delivering. Management was fair, but didn't always allow me to take days off for important events when I requested them. Having to drive long periods of time after heavy lifting, especially while you're stuck in traffic, was why I left."
good,"They're good, but like any company, always need work! They need more cashiers, they need more people in appliances and lumber and definitely need more loaders. Would rather have back up people to schedule/call and not budget less cause with more people n better service you would get more sales, if you make a budget, then you'll get restrictions and a budget yourself! Hard to advance,Not guaranteed hours with any availability,Full time strech is not resonable,Still is a company so of course they still care and think more of themselves than others, Need to hire more people all around esp cashiers, starting to be like walmart, all these registers but only one main one available and very hard to do self check outs with heavy bulk items and stupid machines,Hard to get pt or ft scheduling opportunities in any department,Need more sales reps/people to help in appliances and garden center and more loaders"
good,"I learned a great deal about starting and running programs. I did like this part of the job. At times, the politics were difficult, even for people building new programs."
good,Ok.there are several pros and cons to each position there. It would be unwise if me to point these out at this time. The position is to remain  neutral
good,lowes is a handful to work at. people are so rude there. beneifits are great but management are jerks and like cutting peoples hours when thry ask for more.
good,"I was a part time Lumber Building Materials CSA, some heavy lifting at times, moving 80lbbags of concrete, plywood, sheetrock, Insulation. Fun place to work, most coworkers were nice, managers and supervisors all had problems being arrogant, and demanding. I once got yelled at because I didn't answer a call light while running across the store to upsell more product to a customer, who was  waiting for me at the Board cutting area....  while he was on break...."
good,Most of the employees were friendly and helpful.  Although there were numerous training videos on safety most of the interaction with customers required on the job training and was inconsistent.
good,Lowe's is a fast paced working environment. Work conditions are hot in the summer/cold in the winter. A good pair of tennis shoes is highly recommended for you will be on your feet all day. Safety is highly important. Horseplay is not tolerated at all. You will more than likely be trained on some type of equipment. If quarterly goals are met they reward all the team members with a 45 minute meal catered in and hold drawings for prizes.
good,The overall work culture is good. They provide medicare health benefit and if you want to invest in lowes stocks you can purchase shares at a discount. There is also an employee discount of 1 ten percent.
good,"things get old quick in this retail setting, you have to pick up the slack from slower & older employees, and the constant turnover. needs better pay!"
good,"I can't say this about all their locations but I did enjoy the job I did at the Chico, CA store. Always something to do and it helped me keep productive and made the day go by so much quicker."
good,I enjoyed working with Lowes and the management team cause they listened to concerns and helped you improve yourself to better serve customers. The communication was open with employees and managers to help make regular employees feel more comfortable with any concerns they may have.
good,"This was seasonal work, but you have to treat it as you would any job. You are a part of the company while you are there so behave as a full-time employee. Management was helpful when they were around. its a large place with a lot going on at once. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to help. The customers. The people that work there are nice. The hardest part of the job was leaving."
good,Hard to get on full time or part time.  Treat some people better than others.  Given two breaks and an hour for lunch per 8 hour day.  Have to have open available hours.
good,"Reward hard work and out of the box thinking. "
good,"I make the best of my job. Since I've transferred to a store with all external hires, the environment is more positive but management is difficult. I just want to get out of retail after 5 years of working with Lowe's."
good,Everybody was friendly and helpful. Management was responsive and flexible. Work schedules were posted long in advance and procedure to apply for time off was clear. Procedures were clear and followed. All around nice place to be. Responsibly run and organized.
good,"Overall Lowes is a great company to work for. Decent pay, great benefits for full time employees. They seem to be trying to get rid of Specialist positions. Specialist are paid more than other associates. Every store has a distinct personality. Depending on the management and store manager specifically. Great atmosphere and great associates to work with. You need to be a good time manager of what you do."
good,"Been working at Lowes for six months after retiring from the food industry. Retired after 37 years. "
good,"High volume retail environment servicing the surrounding community.  Lowes stresses, customer, product and safety.  Our job is to give the best customer service possible throughout the store."
good,"Lowes has been a decent place to work. There will always be frustrations when working in a retail environment (balancing customer service on sales floor while getting tasks completed) but I have had plenty of support from management and a great work environment. Anything I’ve wanted to learn, Lowes is willing to teach me. They like to promote within the company."
good,This company gives an oppurtunity to learn new skills and cross train. They're flexible and adaptable with employees given personal situations. It's an environment for growth. There is a tendency to spread associate thin between multiple departments with little to no coverage.
good,This was a seasonal part-time position. The schedule would vary and  you could work different hours each day. The management was approachable and easy to work with. The training was helpful.
good,"Lowe's is generally a good place to work. The southern location in Dothan has great managers and supervisors, but the HR manager and the main store manager don't value or care about their employees, despite putting on a nice face. Direct supervisors are pretty much all great people though. It is still retail, so be prepared to deal with dumb or rude customers. As long as you learn about the products you are selling, you should do well."
good,"a typical day at work is help customers cut and thread pip sale showers doors ect"
good,It's a learning experience.  I learn new stuff all the time and I have been there 4 years. Management is very friendly and the discounts are good as well.
good,"I enjoyed my Co-Workers and really loved the job I was doing it always gave me a sense of accomplishment."
good,"All is well, just looking o make more and better benefits. Lowes is a great company, I just have an open mind and looking around to see alternative options and to see if I can better myself."
good,"In retail success, professionalism is the key.  While in my position at times can be fast paced, the most rewarding part about working there is using your skills to match the customer with the correct solution for their need and their budget."
good,"Typical day is checking your DSHR, IRP, packdown, check orders, call vendors, sales,zoning, cleaning, learning comes from constant computer modules.The hardest part finding working equipment to do your job efficiently,which is limited. The most enjoyable part was making friends."
good,"Can be fast or slow paced environment of work, also can have advantages for advancements with the help of dedication. Good benefits & discounts, overall great job for consistency"
good,"Between everything that happens in the store, it was an entertaining and friendly work environment. Management was appreciative and there was always something to do. Very accepting and protective of employees"
good,Tiene buen ambiente de trabajo solo que el sueldo es un poco bajo.
good,"Some days are stressful, some days do have its rewards. Each day is something new with situations and tasks that need to be performed to ensure a smooth operation across the store."
good,"I loved my job up until the 2016 presidential election, because I was a Trump supporter black people called me a racist and created a hostile working environment, I was coaxed into an argument and terminated."
good,Working for Lowe's 17 years as a kitchen designer allowed me to use my selling skills to meet my objectives and satisfy my customers needs and desires. I worked as a trainer for new hires in this position and I feel Lowe's and myself mutually benefited from my years there.
good,"Lowe's is a fun work place. The employers are nice, respectful to you, and willing to help. Even most of the customer you come in contact with are courteous. I think pay should be a little more considering the long standing hours and work we do."
good,"i worked there for about a year and then i switched to cashier, it was a fun job and i learned many things, i love the people but there are always those bad apples of the bunch and sometimes it turns out to be the managers....the hardest part of the job is safety, if your not paying attention you can hurt yourself or others."
good,good place to work poor management other coworkers are great but managerial staff requires you to complete their job and yous pay is fair and benefits are good
good,The focus on sales and providing exceptional customer service for install needs. Respected product and services. Ever changing specials and events kept the store moving and evolving.
good,Like working at Lowes but the pay does not reflect the work you put in. Management is great vacation time and benefits are great. Hardest part of working at Lowes is dealing with the rotating shift.
good,"Hardest part of the job was when I had a customer that was hard to handle about processing their return, when I had to have security and a manager to escort the out of the store. Most enjoyable part was when I helped the customers and made them happy about purchases."
good,"Good place to start out as a delivery driver. I would recommend this job to someone who likes physical work, someone who can learn quickly and be reliable to show up to work everyday."
good,"Good place to work,fast pace,good benefits,there always doing safety test making sure customers and associates are save, I would recommend them to anyone.."
good,"Working outside was the best, inside not so much. Outside tending to the plants was a really nice job but the cashier position is little to be desired."
good,"I loved my job and the duties it entailed,loved helping people with their projects .I would go above and beyond to help someone find that hard to locate item"
good,I loved my managers and most of my co-workers but when it was busy we had little to no help to fill all the orders and assist customers. Some days it was non-stop to even be able to take your 15 minute break. It frustrated customers and employees and then they did a resizing and cut positions which made it harder.
good,"Selling of special order plumbing products, fashion bath and rough plumbing. Sold special order mill works items, doors, windows and specialty lumber. Backed up all departments from lumber to  appliances and everything in between, maintain stock of products, set up merchandise/end caps, keep all area clean, provide great customer service."
good,Everyone I work with are very helpful when it comes to things I am not aware of what to do. I’m a supervisor over the cashiers and they are very good workers as well which makes my job as a supervisor easy.
good,Lowes has some of the best benefits around.  You will enjoy working there.  It is fast paced and results are expected. You will be on your feet all day .
good,"Its a good first job to have, however there are not many opportunities for career advancement. Especially if you are good at your job they tend to keep you in that job regardless of if you want to advance."
good,Head Cashier position with variety of duties.  People are friendly and good to work with.  Challenging. The hardest part of the job is standing on concrete all day and the hours are not set.  You are required to work any available hours from 5 am to 11 pm.
good,"Great friends and coworkers at Lowes. Good benefits package, my current Service manager is a gem of a fellow, great motivator and personal friendship has developed due to his nature."
good,A typical day at work is loading tucks with product for anywhere from 5 to 7 stores in a neat manner. This job helped me learn organizational skills and how to work in a fast paced environment. In my time at Lowes management slowly declined as they hired more people with no knowledge of the departments they were running. The hardest part of the job was the coordination between the multiple departments in order to run a smooth shift. What i loved the most was the fast pace work and the team members i worked with.
good,Department associates taught me how to enter sale in computer and how the department works (i.e.inventory in computer).  Was not aware of job expectations until company training was completed and time spent on sales floor.
good,"go in have safty meetings,i learned how to get along with others more.managment was ok depends on what city or state u was in.hardest part of job was driving state to state every 2 weeks.met alot of good people along the way"
good,"I love the job, great people to work with. Benefits are very good (BCBS), salary is okay it can definitely be better but they ask you to do everything and everything with insufficient staffing. Some days are slow, some days are pull your hair out busy. *FullTime*"
good,Busy job and often a lack of personnel. The people there make going to work enjoyable.  Training can be an issue sometimes because of a lot of turnover.
good,I enjoyed my job at Lowe's. I would come in in the morning. We would have open group communication before work.  I very much liked my line of work.  Home Décor.
good,"I love sitting here. Everyone is like family. And extremely friendly "
good,Fast paced with high expectations for results. Job requires an individual to be self motivated and productive in execution of their tasks. Training needs more focus and follow up is a must.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work to enhance personal and professional skills. Whether you're a college student looking for part time, or you're looking for a possible career, Lowe's is a good choice. If you find yourself as part of a great team and great management, Lowe's could be the ideal place to work. A downside to Lowe's is that if you don't find yourself as part of a great team and great management, it can be a bit frustrating as accountability can fall a bit short in the company as a whole. The swing shifts, which far outnumber the positions with set schedules, and hours can leave you feeling drained at times. By far the best part of working for Lowe's is that it is more dynamic than many other jobs. Lowe's is certainly not a boring place to work. While there are plenty of advancement opportunities in Lowe's, actually switching jobs is difficult. If there is another position or location you want, you have to wait for the job to open up then apply and interview all over again. The process can take as long as months at times."
good,Great coworkers but tend to be under appreciated by management. Lowes offers good benefits such as medical and matching 401k. Pay does not correspond to job requirements past the support manager role.
good,"Come in and unload the truck"
good,"Fast paced, fun (at least for me it was). Often referred to as trying to drink from a fire hose.  The only challenge that I did not like was the all too often horrid customer. Some were the worst I have experienced anywhere. Trying to shield associates from those horrible individuals was very tough at times. No-one should have to take the idiocy from too many of them!"
good,Very fast paced.  Can be stressful at times.  Being flexible helps.  Hardest part of the job is when you just cannot satisfy the customer.  It really is a disappointment for them to walk out without resolve.  Coworkers were great. Really grateful when managers would chip in and help out.
good,"The work was fine, it was frustrating using a 25 year old, outdated operating system.  Company made a lot of changes to the management organization shortly after I left, not sure how that is working out."
good,"I worked as a cashier, customer service associate. when I left the store i worked at underwent new management that kept making changes to the workflow that made working there needlessly more difficult. little things like taking away cleaning fluid from cash registers, and such."
good,"Cons: Random hours for part time workers, don't usually get holidays off."
good,"The company went through a restructuring process and my position was eliminated, but other then that it was very good pay and benefits for the amount of work they expect."
good,We are a customer service based company we serve our customers before every duty and task given to us. Management could be a lot better but everywhere there is going to be pros and cons. Hardest part of the jobb would just be getting along with management. Most enjoyable would be working with a staff that considers you family
good,The associates are a bunch of great people to work with. With the many different personalities it is really impossible to not make friends. Everyone at lowes are always helpful and look out for eachother and open to helping in work and personal life.
good,"Managed daily Installs scheduled and verified customer satisfaction. Ensured installers and team conducted the job in a professional manner and communicated job details and expectation with customers. Verify all customer service scheduled has been conducted and customer is satisfied. Coordinate any follow up visits if issues arise. Verify and confirm all appointments scheduled daily with installing company. Notify customer and installer of special order arrivals for scheduling. Scheduling of office staff, staging products for install, sales specialist system training and new hire training."
good,the people you work with are amazing and there is always ways to advance in the company if you work hard. you are paid very well with many benefits. full time is the best position because part time doesn't get paid as well for hours. however management could be better and more helpful to the employees under them.
good,Too many computer systems. Not very much training. Nice people to work with.  Does not pay well for all that is expected.  Cut in jobs add extra work loads.
good,"Always busy hardly ever slow, competive work place good management very easy going but often hard work depending on what department you’re in and good breaks"
good,"The best part about my experience with Lowe's was learning about the products in different departments.  It encouraged me to study trades like Plumbing and Electrical outside of work.  The hardest part of the job (in some departments) is that there's not enough staff to help you when the day gets really busy.  You're constantly pulled in different directions and, at times, you do the work that should be allotted to 2-3 people."
good,Working at Lowes came easy to me. I was able to assist customers with no problem. I enjoyed working for Lowes because the possibility of advancing within the company was always open.
good,"Nice place to work. some of the managers and staff members were not team players. You work really hard. You must have great customer service skills to work there."
good,"Good place, wrong manager at my store. He talks down to most women.  People I worked with were good. I worked in 2 management positions there. Love to work just want to be treated with respect"
good,"I am currently still working here at Lowe’s and the job isn’t stressful most of the time. Working nights, you can switch shifts or anything with people so if someone is not coming then you’re down a person or 2 that night. Everything else is fine."
good,"Great opportunity If the management is fixed. Been at 3 locations, all  were great except the one im at now. The promote growth within the company, but management isn't consistent"
good,"I was a delivery driver and had one of the more difficult jobs in the store. very physically active, always moving around. wasn't terribly difficult though."
good,"Lowes is currently making mistakes with purging higher paid employees and hiring less knowledgeable employees and customer service is diminished to a point where the stores favorability in Hutchinson, Kansas is shifting to Home Depot."
good,"Good organization work, friendly and safe. Diversified environment, very cooperative in terms of growth. Hard work along with smart work gets you recognize faster."
good,this is a place were you are allowed to help the customers as much as you can. out of all the companies i have worked for i have never seen a company like this. yes the customer IS first.
good,I enjoyed the job but was passed up multiple times for advancement and since I had started as a temp my pay was much lower than the rest so I found something better.
good,shifts were based upon your requests and the stores need. I found that my manager was willing to work with me and my available hours. I found the training to be good and the workers to be helpful.
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for if you have a supportive management staff. The benefits are great, including the stock options and the 401k. Overall, a place I would recommend."
good,I loved my store and my managers. Hourly employees grumbled some but we tried to turn the culture around.  I enjoyed not always having to be in my office. I was able to be on the floor a lot helping customers.
good,Service Manager is not a very good job.  50+ hours of work but only 40 to do it.  Very little pay and no reward for such a impossible job. Other areas of store are pretty good jobs.
good,Good place to work. Hard to move up to full time. Will take strong commitment and dedication. Very political when moving up the ladder of success. They choose people with likeness and don't diversify.
good,"I am a full-time employee, yet they hired a third delivery driver (my position) which drastically cut down on the hours I worked. I couldn't afford to work here any longer."
good,"Overall fun place to work, make a lot of friends and interact with customers everyday is different that’s what keeps the job interesting. Coworkers are always willing to help you no matter what. Managers treat employees equal there isn’t favorites. It can get crazy sometimes you will find yourself doing multiple things at once for different customers."
good,"I worked for Lowe's for a number of years, and it was a great experience. Most of the time it was fun, but it is definitely stressful, demanding, and customer focus driven. The pace is fast, the expectations are high, and you have to be prepared to be on your own in an entire department without help. This puts stress on the customers because there isn't enough help, and it puts stress on the employee because there is no help to come to the rescue. But, this is not every store. I've worked in 4 locations, and each culture is vastly different, as well as how the management takes care of it's staff."
good,"Great place to work with minimum options to move up accordance with your past and present experience."
good,"Only real issues are pay and standing on your feet 7+ hours a day. Otherwise, good job for part time or temp work! My coworkers are great and always willing to help me learn!"
good,"Great place you will be able to grown and learn different things. Great customers and coworkers, good benefits, learn a lot and met a lot of important people"
good,"I enjoyed Lowe's, would work there again. It was a fast paced day with lots of newness to each workday. the benefits and  people were good.poor Management"
good,"Specialist there can make some serious money. It's a great job if you didn't go to collage because they still pay you very well. I learned A LOT there. It is typical retail work hours which sucks for having a personal life. Some Co-workers are great but, since everyone spends so much time together, there is a lot of drama."
good,"I started right out of college and was taught the skills to move up into management.  Granted, not the best place in America, but all and all not terrible.  It paid the bills and gave me management experience and training to find a new, better paying career."
good,"The company is good.  Good pay,  good benefits,  good people to work with.  The schedule is not good unless you get one of the rare set positions.  The upper management could use some help.  They don't pitch in much and always want more more more.  If you can handle that it's a good job.  The hours are the very worst but that is the world of retail."
good,"I simply need full-time hours.  I like the work and the people very much, but I need full-time benefits and was hoping something would have developed by now.  I'm hopeful!"
good,"i would come in and get the list of tasks for the day at our work station. the job went smoothly for the first 6 months. then, new management took over, and the place became very stressful and toxic."
good,Its is a fun place to work. You meet alot of people and do many different things during the day. You have flexability in your schedule if you are part-time. full- time employees have a set schedule.
good,Steady work but sometimes advancement is limited.  There are sometimes politics involved when wanting to move up within the company even if you are qualified.
good,I enjoy working for Lowe's.  Pleasant environment and people to work with. Good benefits. I'm just ready for a challenge and advancement in my career.
good,"Organization and training wasn't the best. Team culture where everyone was very helpful. I can't rate to effectively since I was temporary/seasonal.  Overall, I would reccomend this experience to anyone."
good,"I enjoyed this job because I like sharing my knowledge and helping people do their electrical projects. Of course like most corporations, these stores are understaffed, and can be totally frustrating at times. You need to realize that you can only do as much as you can."
good,"Lumber, concrete loader, assisting customers with loads of lumber, concrete, dishwashers, fridges, forklift driver when needed, inventory clerk when needed"
good,Enjoyed my work duties and the interaction with clients.  The environment was a fun and competitive one.  The ability to work with own initiative.  Nice work area.
good,I worked as a regular employee for 2 years until I became a PSA. The one thing I really loved about this position was because it was a Monday-Friday position from 6am - 3pm which gave me time with my children. I was a single mom at the time which was great for me.  I also enjoyed doing resets and merchandising product.
good,"Management was pretty good, understanding and helpful."
good,"I worked there for a summer job. The people were nice, and I always had something to do. It wasn't a particularly interesting job, but it allowed me to make some money over summer."
good,"I had a fairly nice experience working for Lowe's, my coworkers were very nice and the managers were nice too. The one problem was the managers didn't always know what was going on, we were often overflowed with stock in the receiving are."
good,The job was rough starting out because I really had no one to train me but I learned a lot on my own and became really good at my job. You have to be self motivated to succeed there.
good,Although you are constantly moving you develop relationships with your customers and see them frequently. I learned a great deal about inventory and stocking. It is not an easy task to keep the department neat and replenished while also being the point of contact for any and all customers.There is room for growth which is why I applied.
good,"I was given an assembly position at Lowe's which was a great fit for me since it was relaxed and slow-paced, which fit my personality very well. On a shift, I would stay in the back of the store in the assembly area and work on products that customers ordered, mainly grills but occasionally outdoor furniture. The environment was very fun and easy-going because, although we had a quota of 1 grill per hour, there was never any need to rush in the building process of said grill. My managers were excellent and kind and would talk to me as a friend more than an underling. My coworkers and I would be able to listen to our own music during the shift and we enjoyed our job immensely."
good,"First thing, walk my department looking for safety hazards, preventing a safety hazard,  making sure entrance doors are clear of all debris. Should be clear at all times.  I have learned to operate the counterbalance forklift, reach forklift. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the customers and understanding how Lowe's can help them with their projects.  Also....Working with my co-workers.  Hardest part of the job - learning the whole store of over 60,000 different products"
good,You must be willing to work hard and be willing to work all types of hours from 4am till 1130pm.  You can only get to management if you are willing to work for it.
good,"Lowe's is a decent place to work. Depending on what department you are in, the job can be stressful or pretty decent. Nice clean environment, good pay and benefits, good people."
good,"The company was fantastic, the staff is amazing. The management is slacking, but its a good place to work."
good,Outside Lawn and Garden area was physical as it included loading soil and other items up for customers and placing them in their vehicles.  The pace is quick but manageable.
good,"Relaxed dress code with the exception of work vest to determine status of service. No day is the same in customer service fields. Some good days and not so good days persist. Everyone has the same goal, to take care of the customer."
good,"decent job, can't complain. get on the managers good side and you are set. focus on working on each task and don't get stressed out. you gain some nice skills."
good,Working within a hardware store you tend to learn an assortment of new skills and product information. The amount of variety when it comes to the knowledge factor is unmatched. Everyone is friendly for the most part and the store works solely on everyone depending on one another to do their specific tasks. A good skill I have learned from working at Lowes is learning how to work on the fly. Multi-tasking is something you will learn how to do quickly because the customer demand is higher than the work power Lowes can provide.
good,"I really enjoy working here, the customers are really great, but i am the type of individual that can't meet a stranger."
good,"Most days are good days, customers are great. Most of the people i work with are very enjoyable people to work with, dont deal with alot of drama. Management is  horrible though. Schedules are always messed up, some never help on the floor, and some never leave the office only to yell at you."
good,"Was a seasonal employee, worked mainly days. Lowe's is very good about working with you on schedules that fit what you need. Loved all coworkers, great place to work."
good,"In the paint department mixing, cleaning and refilling paint."
good,"As you deal with customers from all different walks of life on a continous basis, this can be a very demanding, but rewarding job. Fast paced, on your feet all day."
good,"I worked for a few years here and liked working for Lowe's. After the changes made in 2017, everything changed(and not for the better of the employees). Also, there is always lack for help and people don't stay  long. The work schedule for full time employees is horrible and it's hard to plan around it. I stayed as long as I did honestly for my co-workers, but this job can be stressful and draining at times."
good,"I have no opinion on this matter to disclose. I worked with great people in my department, yet the upper management had no concern in life other than or outside of Lowes. I was told by a Manager to ""bring me and my kidney stones to work or dont come back"", after being diagnosed by a Physician who recommended 3 days off to pass teh painful stones. Needless to say I was at work those days."
good,I am a very social person who tries to get along with everyone i work with. I stay on task and help where needed. I enjoyed working at lowe's unfortunately due to the hours and career opportunities i have to move on.
good,"Working at Lowes your expected to know the area your working end other wise its going to be bad experience for you and the customers. However, this doesn't stop someone from actually going into other departments do things they may have knowledge of."
good,"great place to work with good pay and bonuses, also health dental and vision care through lowes dc, equipment training good long 12 shifts plus breaks"
good,"Schedules weren't consistent. Sometimes the tasks didnt really make sense and they didnt allow much freedom with to merchandise. my direct manager was a complete jerk. caught him stealing lawn mowers reported it to store management and i got reprimanded. I loved the other coworkers and customers were great, and the days screamed by"
good,Managing the day to day scheduling of multiple parties to coordinate a kitchen or bathroom installation.  Making sure that all appointments are kept and resolving any issues that occur within the project.
good,"Lowe's is a very positive workplace, at least inside the Lowe's store I worked in. I learned a lot about salesmanship. I really liked the positive vibes of Lowe's. My coworkers always tried to keep it positive and they loved to laugh with associates and customers alike."
good,"I’ve been with Lowes for about almost 3 years I started off working two jobs at rite aid and Lowes I actually had both interviews on the same day Lowes first then rite aid but I started working at rite aid first then Lowes a couple months later in the receiving department and the reason why I liked working at Lowes was to get the experience working in a warehouse and also driving the Machines (forklifts,stand up forklifts& order pickers) that made the job better and fun  because I love to drive the machines and with my experience working there the managers know I’m a great employee and driver when operating heavy equipment."
good,"there is n flexibly on breaks,"
good,"Lowes Home Improvement was a good job and I learned a lot from working there. The employees were easy to get along with and while I was training, they do their best to make it easy for you o understand. The hardest part about working at Lowes was holidays when the store would be very busy."
good,"Lowe’s was a great place to work and was very rewarding, as it was very hard work. I had to step up and do the job of 2-3 people as Lowe’s had trouble keeping people staffed in the flooring department because it was so difficult. I learned how to manage a department and got to work closely with the store manager. It was a great learning experience, however Lowe’s having a very ambitious CEO with goals to be one of the top companies in the nation, they were always looking to cut expenses, very hard to get a raise, and at the end of my time there they made a company wide decision to fire all department managers. This did not go well for many stores and killed morale in the store."
good,"This is a fast paced retail, with dedicated team members but has a lot of dead weight.  Red tape has made challenging as a member of management to reduce dead weight."
good,A great place for the entry level job seeker. Management can work with you to help get the according training assigned and accommodate you for your position. Delivery and Lumber department are always looking for help.
good,"Fast paced work environment; lots of customers, always something new to learn, lot of teamwork with neigboring departments, could be stressful at times but manageable."
good,It's ok it's very fun in sthere me cases I love the customers and co workers management is ok  the pay is also good the benefits and getting to know the customers
good,"I left this place of employment for something that turned out to be a mistake. Lowes is a good place to work and has decent opportunity for advancement,"
good,"I worked for lowes RDC for 9 years.  I would work for lowes again.  The hours are long, but the people are great.  They are a fair and honest workplace."
good,"Would have never left except for restructuring plans."
good,Loved working here it was structured and fast paced. There were clear goals and guidelines that left you able to complete task without wondering if you were doing it correctly
good,"Work environment is great for students but career advancement is almost unheard of. The pay scale could really use some work. New hire employees are commonly paid more than tendered and knowledgeable employees. Also, taking on more responsibility only takes on extra work, no compensation is awarded."
good,I enjoy my job at Lowes but I need full time hours.  I pay my own bills and find it hard to make ends meet on part time hours.  It is hard to get on full time
good,Working at lowes was fun. the employees were friendly and had a positive attitude. You got to have a few minutes of free time while no customers needed help.
good,I loved working for the company hence spending 8yrs there. At times there was a shortage with staff which required one person taking on multiple work loads but when we were staffed it was a great environment.
good,"This was a productive, focused place to work -- albeit with very little training or opportunities for advancement. They also concentrate on short-term, part-time hiring practices."
good,"- Las actividades del trabajo son sencillas.."
good,Everyday I would get up at 3:30 am go to work and stock shelves until about 10:00 then go to the docking area unload trucks with the forklift and take products out to the floor when i wasn't busy i would usually move appliances or help out other people using a picker and forklift down stock stuff or put items up into storage until 4:00 and clock out
good,"I really Enjoy working in the Lowe's environment, team environment as well the ability for growth. Loews provide great training tools. The drive to help customer achieve their dream home goals! Have some of the best brand out in the market!, set Loews aside in the home improvement market"
good,"Management and coworkers in the building have made working at lowes a breeze, the management is now changing and benefits are being taken away which is making the whole atmosphere dreadful. The work schedule is perfect."
good,"Before the company started making a lot of crazy changes, I though it was a great place to work with great people.  Then it got out of control with ridiculous things that were near impossible for a short staffed store to accomplish."
good,This is a perfect job for those just starting out. The wages aren't competitive at all and most people are underpaid. All in all the atmosphere is nice but definitely more geared towards people just starting to work
good,"Lowe's use to be a good company to work for in the past, awesome management, coworkers, benefits and pay. After a bunch of years and lots of management changes things got a lot worse."
good,Company pay is good. Can always ask for help when needed. Great team support. Fast pace business. Everyday you came to work it was something different.
good,Working at Lowe's has given me a lot of life experience on how to interact with customers. It has also taught me how to handle tough situations positively.
good,Good pay and benefits for a retail position . After a management change is was not a pleasant place to work. Management assigned more tasks than you could complete and still help customers. Associates were great to work with.
