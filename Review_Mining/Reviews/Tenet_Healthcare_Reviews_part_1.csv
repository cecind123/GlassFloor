bad,"Maybe it's a good company in US but in Philippines, its not. the management are hilarious. Its making you feel hopeful but the truth is your not. They will let you go in  the air like your nothing."
bad,"Unfortunately, there are low perks on this company. You will be overwork, constantly stressed out. Low pay and poor training, consisting of three days per department. No job security, the human resources department is nonexistent. They will write out for mistakes even during training. Don't sign those. Coworkers are friendly just riding the boat same as you. Good Luck if you decide to work for this company. Unionized, time to fight for better benefits and job security for the employee."
bad,High school click atmosphere with the administrators having only a high school diploma.  No admin skills.  Ignorance is rampant.  Hires share the same ignorance as the leaders
bad,It’s about the money for Tennet . They talk a big game about them being there for pts but it’s all about money . When it’s slow ( which you don’t have control over) they send you home . When it’s busy they won’t give you a day off . And when you want a day off they have no coverage. So your PTOs rack up and you have 500 pto hours you can’t use because they can’t give you off . Then you lose your PTO hours .
bad,"I’ve received no training to do my job.  People are cut out of the blue with no plan for others to absorb that person’s job.  Therefore, problems eventually surface and no one knows what to do."
bad,"Work culture will kill you, unless you're already a terrible person. No positive reinforcement, just criticism, even if you are doing well.  Management is a joke, uninvolved in employee work and issues."
bad,"Hard work, long hours and very little promotion.   Management not knowledgeable of work and no help.  No directions on goals or  procedures.  Favoritism to certain employees."
bad,You start at 730 am but you have to show up at 650 am just to get a route.you then load a van with 320 packages with 235 stops. Your out 12 plus hrs a day with no overtime. There's no breaks. No advancement opportunities.  They steal money from your checks. The boss lies about your money. Then if you ask questions they make it impossible to work. They basically try and force you to quit so they don't pay u any unemployment.  Over all avoid at all cost. Very fast paced and extremely physical work.
bad,"Big for-profit corporation that does not follow its own mission statement.  FT staff get told to not show up for your shift frequently, come in later and stay later, placed on call or canceled altogether.  You never know if you're going to get your work hours.  They follow a matrix for staffing that is unsafe.  They will purposely work you short-staffed and coworkers take a turn with you getting their hours cut.  The work is so exhausting physically and mentally.  No work-life balance. Expect short checks.  They call this ""hospital convenience leave"" and it only works to their benefit. If you don't have any sick days left then you just earn no money.  Leadership is toxic and changes constantly.  Nurse to patient ratios are extremely high and dangerous.  A mass exodus of unhappy staff replaced with new graduates that also do not last.  I do not recommend. A simple google search will speak volumes of their terrible antics. Benefits are very poor with insurance very costly and deductibles so high you cannot get basic diagnostic testing done because deductible has to be met before they start paying."
bad,"I have been here over three years. Total nepotism in Tinley Park. If you are a friend or family member you will advance quick. They will throughly train you. If not, you are on your own. You have productivity and quality expectations to meet after 90 days. If they are not met they will write you you. After 6 months they will let you go with no real explanation. The managers are all friends of the executives or former executive who did not work for their position but where given their positions. They will micromanage you to no end. There's not room for advancement unless you are family or a friend. There's lack of diversity amongst the management team and executive team. I even heard a manager say she would never hire Spanish speaking reps. If you are a career minded individual stay away from this place. Plus the company for sale and they are constantly laying employees off."
bad,This hospital only cares about their bottom line. They offer no education or growth opportunities. They do not value their employees and many are not happy to work here
bad,This place is a slave camp and always trying to find something wrong that you did or didn't do.  I got written up for coming in 2 minutes early than usual.
bad,"This organization was oober corporate.  Lots of politics ... more than usual.  First public company I worked for, I would not recommend working for Tenet unless you have a strong backbone."
bad,"Poor working conditions, poor culture, manual process for everything do not keep up with technology, poor benefits and compensation, departments do not take responsibility of their own functions."
bad,Basically second shift started off by making sure you touch base with first shift and making sure if they started on any laboratory work you would be the one to finish it. The manager was not a good manager because she tell all of you confidential business to the other staff members which was not fair at all and the fact she was not doing here job and she never covered people when it was time for a lunch break instead she would go an hide somewhere in the hospital laboratory so you couldn't find her when you needed help.
bad,"I don't like it here"
bad,This position was a long time ago and I do not think any of the people I worked with or for are still there. I have nothing useful to contribute. Tenet is not a very good company
bad,"willing to sacrifice patient safety for profit and more than willing to skirt the laws, rules, and regulations.  Not interested in the needs of the employee"
bad,"A typical day was good"
bad,Staff nurse on a med-surg floor.  Neurology and orthopedics.  Average of 4-6 post-op patients per day.  Rarely got break or lunch.  Sometimes had to eat standing up.  High stress to perform little compensation or recognition.
bad,"You could not pay me a million dollars to EVER go back to Frye. The supervisors have no idea how to run a lab. The lack of team work, work ethic, and professionalism is absolutely Ridiculous and almost permitted."
bad,Supervisor did not have experience in the program and did not understand workload demands. Unable to work in desired dept due to lack of license. Upper management did not support lower level employees.
bad,"The management was atrocious,  very unprofessional and you never had support when needed.  The patient care was so bad and even when you tried to speak up to get it fixed for our patients no one gave a darn.   It was such a stressful environment that it was time to leave.  No one should endure a work place environment like that.  Even though they say you have breaks well that's a lie."
bad,"Heavy  patient  load,  paper  charting,  poor  management,  low  senses,  low  wages,  cancelations  of  shifts,  no  benefits,  went  through  a  change  of  ownership."
bad,Staff were not helpful to each other. Did not always have adequate staffing to fulfill job duties.  Sometimes it was difficult to talk to management because they were busy in meetings.
bad,"I worked as "" careparnter at SLU under tenet healthcare. I enjoyed the people that I worked with. The hours were great. I got a lot of experience at SLU."
bad,Tenet Administration is the only department that benefits with big yearly raises - poor working conditions and lousy pay. Tenet does not support their employees and lacks professionalism and respect for staff (other than administration).
bad,"The EVS department is outsourced to Sodexo, creating a very low pay grade to the technicians. The Manager spoke of employees personal affairs with other employees."
bad,You can always be replaced! They do not care about patient health or customer service all they care about is money. They want the doctors to see any patient in 15 min no matter what the problem is....Really!
bad,Worked in the therapy dept. Not sure how many managers I had but they loved to tell you how to do your job. Lots of drama and gossiping. Clinical staff always stressed about productivity. Told by DOR to chart off the clock. Tripple booking of patients makes it impossible to give good patient care.
bad,"Not only were the bosses ride they lacked any communication anytime you mess up. Especially I. The housekeeping at Hi Desert Medical Center in Joshua tree,ca. The E.V.S people were not very good at communicating or keeping things professional some of the C.N.A are the same way When I get my R.N this is not a hospital I would want to work at let alone go when I am sick."
bad,"Brookwood used to be a good place to work for a RN but now it is so short staffed that management puts up with lazy nurses, mean nurses and call ins. We have too many new grads and not enough experienced nurses which I feel is unsafe. It seems now that they are willing to hire any warm body with a nursing license. The only part of my job I enjoy is seeing my patients improve. Our annual raises are pathetic as are our benefits. Our shift differential here is lower than other hospitals and we are not given any holidays or sick days. If you want off you have to use paid time off."
bad,"If these are the ""type"" of people that Tenet wants leading a hospital then all Higer Ups at Tenet need to take a better look at their morals!!"
bad,"Administration has no backing for employees.  They lie to your face!!! The COO is clueless!!!  She is just a kid!!!  Everything comes out of her mouth is full of non-sense.  She has no respects from anyone in the hospital!  The CNO - is just a bad manager all together- do not count on her backing you up!  She lies and denies everything very well!!!  When things go well, it is hers.  When things are not going well, it is you!"
bad,"Experience horrible.  Over worked, no help provided. PAtient care suffered. Management needs to be revamped. Employees unsAtisfied with result."
bad,"It was the worst first RN position possible.  Nights and a crazy, mean, cussed like a sailor charge nurse who could do and did what ever she wanted. Scary to patients and worse to her staff.  Do not recommend this place for anyone nice or pleasant. You'll hate it!!!  The CNA'a actually slept on the job!  Unbelievable."
bad,Very Productive workplace. Being new to this company is so different than what I'm use to. Speaking on my current department I'm not happy but blessed to have a job
bad,This company has no benefits. The management is run poorly. Barely knows what is going on withing the company on a day to day basis until it is to late. Safety hazard for all of the field staff. Office staff is always treated poorly especially when your next on the list to being fired or forced to quit.
bad,A typical day at work is very busy and hectic.  I have learned a lot in my time employed at Fountain Valley and will be able to take the invaluable skills with me and share with my next employer.
bad,"This hospital users. They used people,they promise a benefits and fire on last day on probation period. Only relatives can be hired with real benefits. They found anything to fired you!!!! Without any explanation!!!!!!!! The worse place to work!!!! The radiologist doctor ---- asian one-she is pretend like she is a queen of earth. "
bad,"Very challenging to work in this IT department, the director and infrastructure manager are incompetent and uncaring"
bad,"Very poor management that has no respect for its employees.  Management is very unprofessional, negative environment,very inconsistent with polices and procedures.  They make them up as they go.  No work/life balance or respect for their employee; major turnover."
bad,Compensation and benefits are not beneficial for a family to survive on. No room for growth.
bad,Anti-male RN environment.  Supervisory level bias toward certain employees.
bad,"patient flow was slow, "
bad,"So I externed here for my externship for school. Ugh, let me tell you, Dr. Tejani is not the most pleasant person to work with. She is so stern and timid, I hardley learned anything by her, but more of on my own. The medical assistants are pretty rude. One of them was filling up prescriptions on a downlow (with no doctor's approval) for another co-worker. (It least dont do it infront of a student). Oh and its an OBGYN office. The tools used for (lets just say..) ""down there"" where old and rusted, even if they were cleaned properly and put in the autoclave. Not to mention everything was out of date, old school and I felt like I would never go there as a patient. "
bad,"This hospital could be one of the best because there are some amazing nurses and doctors working there. The management issue is serious and it needs to be addressed to prevent good, experienced nurses form pursuing careers elsewhere."
bad,I have no other experience to compare. I enjoyed my working experience
bad,"Worked in the PMCU. It was an experience. Though the staff was knowledgeable and it is a teaching hospital, they are not totally open to new methods of treatment."
bad,Tenet is a nice facility to work under I enjoyed coming to work and working with my co-worker meting  patient and family member I like working with the doctor.
bad, Making rounds on patients in the hospital resolving any problems that they might of had. Chairperson of the patient experience committee. Educating the staff on AIDET. Working along with the risk management attorney. I learned  about AIDET and all types of patients.  The management was not very good.  The co-workers in time were starting to come around  but not very considerate of their patients or new staff. The hardest part of the job was the patients and the staff. I did not enjoy any part of the job.
bad,"Typical day, No leadership found, was glad to go home."
bad,"Tenet is awful in the manner that they allow conifer health systems to manage their clerical/admitting departments."
bad,"St.Christopher's Hospital had a major layoff friday march 15,2013. Administration is clueless, and will LIE to your face. Its a toxic work rnvironment, and employees go to work, not sure if they will lose their job that way. You can be a loyal employee for 32 years, and you will get targeted by the COO for termination, or a layoff."
bad,"Incompetent managemeot rid of the Chief Medical Officer because she held directors accountable, and prioritized patient safety first. When administration wants to fire you, they will say its a reduction in workforce. Watch your back with this company, because working for them will challenge your ethical values. r them will challenge your ethical values. All about generating revenue, instead of focussing on patient care."
bad,"Management incompetent, arrogant, and cant think outside the box, and directors bullie staff"
bad,"Horrible place and company to work for. Management not promoted from within, and do not know the work."
bad,"st.chris is a danger to patients. There is a reason it is not ranked in sny category. No support from management, and it id a ""bullying envirnment"" by senior leadrtship. There is a one box rule in management because of the imsecureness of ceo- your job is not secure, so dont keep more stuff in your office that wont fit in one box, otherwise, security will escort you out!! The ceo will say its a ""reduction in workforce ""."
bad,"Typical day is a non-stop work shift. I have learned that even if you tried to work hard and provide the best care possible and perform as expected it will not be taken into consideration. This company is racist, unfair and dont care with employees. Some co-workers pull you down, hardest part of the job is prolong standing no breaks."
bad,high stress; often no breaks or lunch if someone calls out; clicks; backstabbing; two-faced atmosphere; low end pay requesting high end results; do not need ANY medical background in order to read doctor scripts; condescending management.
bad,A place to go if you don't mind starving and carrying your lunch home.
bad,Higher ups are rude and have a superior attitude. Particularly the corporate attorney.
bad,"This is the worst hospital to choose from. The work load is high, the pay is low, the management does nothing about employees who are sexually inappropriate, the hospital is dark, dirty and depressing. I'd work at Walmart before I'd work at Good sam again."
bad,"Do not apply there. The worst managers ever. Retaliating,racist,homophobe. Do yourself a favor and stay away from that awful place."
bad,"You come in do your job and go home.No one looking out for employees and pay is the worst for work load."
bad,We are always short staffed. People always call in. Doctors always complain that nothing is ever fast enough. Techs don't do what they are supposed to so everything falls back on the nurse. It's terrible. I had this job.
bad,"Lack of accountability and leadership in department.  Untrained, unskilled Managers promoted to oversee new department.   Managers pile the majority of the work on a few “workhorse” employees  and ignore the unskilled, uneducated labor they have hired to fill the department."
bad,"Tenet is stressful, with the accountability in all of the wrong places. Managers were not the best fit for the role but were allowed to stay regardless of how many complaints were filed against them."
bad,"Not much else to say. Worst upper management imaginable they made it challenging, energy draining environment made it a terrible place to work. Unfriendly place to work, at least in the corporate offices. Some staff was not very positive."
bad,"No comment at this time."
bad,"On a typical day, a respiratory therapist has a big workload. I occasionally don't get to leave on time due documentations and departmental tasks. The worst part is the hospital doesn't pay for on call. There have been many situations whereby a therapist called out. If no one covers it, a single therapist is expected to cover all the floors in the hospital (about 100 beds). I have to admit my co-workers are what contributed to this bad experience. I had to deal with belittlement and degradation from some not all of them on a continuous base. I chose to leave this hospital because it basically has taken a toll on my mental and physical well-being."
bad,Management (HR) some are there for themselves. Advancement not possible unless u kiss everybodys behind and dont have a sight of backbone. My supervisor was threatened by my degree completion so she started writing me up. The nurses dont pay attention to documentation or drug doses. Most of thr people are rude and complain about everything. Had to go i was very unhappy.
bad,This work place pays very low. Management is horrible. If you don't mind getting a ham or a turkey as your Christmas bonus and nothing more then this place is for you.
bad,New management is crazy! No healthcare experience. Do not care about employees. Keep taking more and more away. No work/home balance. Would not recommend.
bad,"This was 100% catfish job, interviewed for specific duties but was quickly told that I would not be doing the job I interviewed for.  Local and Regional leadership was extremely toxic."
bad,I was horrible and depressing getting up to go to this job. The worst place I ever worked for in Life.There is nothing more to say. Just a HORRIBLE place to work.
bad,Lots of organization political issues with limited opportunity for growth. Limited resources to do the job. People placed in roles outside of their skill set. Poor leaders.
bad,"Nursing Leadership is inexperienced-no clinical skills,inconsistent treatment,unable to lead. Depending on who you are & who you are related to is how your treated. You have to become part of the Nursing Leadership click in order to survive. If you are a creative staff member you will not be able to work here and survive. If you are spanish speaking & only follows orders, you will do great in this facility. The nurses run scared as many of them know little to no English and have no other facility to go to. Lack of policies/standardization/ quality teams. RATIOS RN 8 pt's & CNA's/PCT's go as high as 16 pt's per shift, YES believe it. Opportunity for Union representation for the nursing staff in order for higher pay & less patient ratio's. Patient Care Technicians are exhausted at night and sleep on the job. They take turns and frequently patients that are under 1:1 observation (escape). One recently escaped two weeks ago. You would figure the employee taking care of this 1:1 patient would no longer be allowed to work as they are placing patients at risk, but the employees say their story and management believes them & turns the other way. The GI department is a total joke. If you're having a procedure there watch out. Ensure that your scope / equipment is clean. Depending on how many procedures have been done for the day depends on your chances on getting a clean scope. They have very little equipment and book lots of procedures. Not enough time to keep the equipment clean. Surgery is a dangerous place to walk into. Depending on who your doctor is, is the risk that you  more..."
bad,Recently worked here doctors are great patient are also great. Made a couple of good friends. Would have been a great job if it weren't for the manager she is verbally abusive expresses herself by shouting at staff in public areas within the clinic. She is a bigot and by far the worse manager I have ever worked with. Multiple employees have complained to her boss and nothing ever happened. Work here at your own risk.
bad,"Management is not professional. Clock-out for lunch but eat at your desk and still work. Too many Chiefs, not enough Indians. Way too much backstabbing! I would not recommend this job to anyone. 12 hour shifts with only one person."
bad,Run away. They still use a DOS based accounting system in 2017. Upper management is very disrespectful and incompetent. Massive turnover rate. No work/life balance. If the first of the month lands on a weekend you have to work that day same for holidays.
bad,"the managers are being not up to par, the training is incomplete, judgement in work assignments not very well thought out, unfair treatment but dress it up to disguise it"
bad,"Hardest part of the job was getting your co-workers to follow your lead. Too many chiefs not enough Indians. Management wants you to succeed but they want you to do it on your own, very hard to get the backing and supported needed to succeed."
bad,The workers are nice and they do their best to do a good job.  The location is in a nice area and there are lots of places to eat at during lunch.
bad,"I started as a Network Tech and advance to Educator.  The new government HIPPA regulations for training and certification was opened and I was promoted.  I trained all in-house medical staff, temp staffing tech and doctors and their staff.  This training and certification was required by the government before a member of the medical staff could work at our facility."
bad,"The managers require you to work overtime with only a days notice.  If you are scheduled to work in the evening and someone calls off for the overnight shift, you are required to work your shift and the next shift.  That is an 18 hour shift!  They have been short staffed for over a year, so the pharmacy technicians have been working 16+ hour shifts regularly.  They will lie about the job when you interview.    After your 90 days, they will tell you that they are short staffed and you will have to stay overnight or come in 8 hours early.  They won't remember the lies they told you during the interview.  If you can dedicate your life to this job, take it. If you have a family or a life outside of work, this is not the job for you. Every job has it's downfalls, but this is like nothing I have ever seen before.  RUN!"
bad,"Good Samaritan In Brockton, Ma is  toxic since the take over of Steward!  The managers are bullies, there is a one way street and they are in the drivers street.  They write you up over anything, they are even taking photos!  If you have taken care of a patient you are responsible 24/7 regardless if you are the actual caregiver or not. If anything  goes wrong  everyone named in documentation is held accountable.  Everything goes in your file.  The staff have left in droves with the new manager of the telemetry floor. There is a constant threat of losing your job.  Even new staff leave as soon as they can. Steward is blind to him!"
bad,"Its an ok job to work for, depending on who u working with as far as management on those particular days."
bad,"My job was fabulous for the first two weeks when a regional manager stepped in to micromanage every one of the urgent care centers.  The regional manager made comments about my staff not respecting me as a leader, but how can they be expected to do any different when a manager at the regional level constantly undermines every decision I make as the site manager.  There was a TOTAL absence of onboarding procedures upon my arrival, no MSDS period (no binder no nothing), no accessible  policy and procedures as were appropriate to an outpatient environment, no skills check off for staff, untrained staff administering medications without proper verification of education/demonstration.  Staff with expired credentials continuing to work scheduled shifts.  Lack of termination of access to patient private information after no longer being employed.  Total lack of foresight by the micromanaging regional manager(she was not able to do so as she was focused on proving managers incompetent to subordinate staff.)  Requested regional manager have hours of operation and phone number printed professionally on door for information of those who might come by and clinic was not open.  Asked for mirrors or cameras to see blind spots in waiting areas to prevent an unobserved deterioration in a patient's condition.  Both suggestions were met by an eye roll of the regional manager.  Good luck to all Medpost locations!  It is going to be an uphill climb."
bad,"Tenet only cares about money.  They do not care about patient safety, employee satisfaction, or keeping their word.  Nursing supervisors have literally lied to my face.  I could go on."
bad,"working with other, working in a fast pace area, working patients, handling patient needs, a lot of prob. solving"
bad,I started this job as a new nurse and experienced incredible adversity from my director at the time and the senior nurses. I would never work at this facility again. I got my years of experience in and passed my critical care course and found another job at a different hospital.
bad,"Among other issues, I worked in MSO, the work is overwhelming and not adequate staff for the workload.  A typical day at this office is you worked from the time you start to the time you leave and there is time for break except for lunch.  It feels like you never get the work done no matter how much you work."
bad,Brookwood’s Tenet Healthcare facility lack of diversity among races and religious practices produced a very hostile work environment that is unhealthy for employees and unwelcoming to persons of diverse faith practices.
bad,"Work is work, but it shouldn't have to be.  Companies can make work enjoyable and engage their employees, but this company doesn't do that, although they ""say"" they do.  Leadership says they care about culture, but they really don't.  They care about themselves, and that is it."
bad,"Nothing to say. Did not get the support I needed."
bad,"Employees are treated like 2nd class citizens. Security harrasses employees. The cafeteria is embarrassingly overpriced. Not enough parking for staff. The only terrific thing in the hospital are the frontline staff. Nurses, techs, lab, volunteers, transporters. They fight to give the best care and sadly the biggest fight they have to provide excellent care is with management."
bad,Pay is very low compared to the national average Financial Representative pay. Employees are very friendly but you can tell they are not happy.
bad,Worked at SLU Hospital for many years before Tenet took over. Only cared about making money and kept chipping away at benefits. They bought a bunch of hospitals in the area and then closed them down putting a lot of people out of jobs.
bad,"Management ignores bullying even when very aware of it happening, even amongst supervisors. The benefits were awesome though. The blue shirts were horrible and very poorly made but very expensive."
bad,Tenet is a hot mess. Laying off people not at one time but 1 person a week. Makes job security very uncertain. Management will hardly speak with you. It’s a different culture to get used to.
bad,Tehs are not paid well for the work load that is given but things are improving except the pay.The management work with you but it is nothing they can really do if you are involved with the union.
bad,"-Severely Understaffed Facilities "
bad,"The patients are great. No complaints on the Director and Management in my unit, but the hospital administration has no system in place in the departments and no order. Too much drama going on. The hours are inconsistent and the placements are unstable. A lot of false promises and favoritism. No one is compensated according to education and experience. It's cheap labor through out the hospital."
bad,A typical day at work consisted of running at least 5 Endoscopy rooms and 6 extended rooms for Abdominal Paracentesis. A typical day included not getting lunch or sometime eating at your desk. I was a working manager in the department working side by side with the staff to let them know that I too could feel the stress of working short. Even though I worked on the floor I spent long  hours getting my management duties completed. I enjoyed working with people meeting their needs.
bad,"Most days are busy. The hardest but most enjoyable part of my job would be the patients and their families."
bad,"very demanding, for profit organization. I can say no more because I still work here and cant really speak my mind, but all I can say is that I am still actively looking for another job-that should say it all.."
bad,"Terrible Administration. Only care about money, not staff and patients. Chief nursing officer not supportive of staff. CEO never around. No support for staff. Degrading. Would never work here again. Looking for another position. Look anywhere but Tenet"
bad,"A typical day at this site at noon, was high volume with pleaseant patrons. Loving atmosphere, with people who needed critical aid."
bad,"The management has some kinks to work out. I worked there for 6 going on 7 years. Laboratory machines in good condition,  staff is usually short so fill in days are required."
bad,"No ""real"" education offered, terrible management, no advancement, very low pay for they area, lackadaisical doctors, chronic under staffing, lack of integrity and honesty etc..."
bad,"TPR manages the physician practices for Tenet Healthcare.  My experience with TPR has shown it to be irresponsible with no intent in being responsive to physician needs or the needs of the office practices.  TPR personnel on sight seldom return phone calls and make promises that they never intend to keep.  If its not in writing, it will never happen and if it is in print, it subject to interpretation and the physician seldom benefits.  TPR personnel never actually lie.  They simply do not respond or tell the whole truth.  Information is always asymmetrical.  The physician never gets the whole story.  The practices are overseen to make profits but are given little resources or additional resources needed to accomplish the tasks."
bad,Manager was incompetent and always untruthful.  Staff left in a mass exodus due to unsafe and unfair work conditions.  Nurses often had 3 patients in the ICU.
bad,undergoing significant structure changes at all levels of the organization...inexperienced personnel being set up for failure with new assignments begin asked to take on
bad,I come to work; do 13 hours and go home. It was a decent place to work for the first 2 years..then CEO's change and from then it just went to been a unhappy place to work.
bad,"While employed - discrimination; age discrimination; harassment was engaged in within the workplace by supervisors without fear of reprimand. Management turned a blind eye and deaf ear to it, as did H.R., and became a party to it. Once reporting this to H.R. there was retaliation on the part of supervisors and management against the employee. Promises made, time and again, by management for additional training were NEVER fulfilled.Older employees were discarded with while younger ones were favored - one only now remains employed. Our staff was once six. IMHO Tenet ruined the company it bought once taking it over and did so, in part, by destroying patients trust and faith. When terminated, the separation agreement given by Tenet, absent any employee input, demands that you sign away ALL legal rights although some demands made are prohibited by law, especially with regard to older employees. Also, the agreement is one sided with regard to disparagement therefore, an employee remains at risk with regard to future or potential employers. This also goes to confidentiality. 50% of our staff left due to the hostile workplace environment created by our supervisor. What I learned - H.R. is an advocate for the employer and not a neutral third party. Employees beware. Management will stand behind their ""chain of command"" regardless of any wrongdoing. There was no enjoyable part of the job especially when having to walk on eggshells due to the mood swings of our direct report/supervisor and once this supervisor targeted a staff member. Co - workers were great."
bad,"Horrible place to work!! Where I worked, for a family practice it was a nightmare! They hired a ""supervisor"" who was more of a ""put bull"". She came in a created a very hostile work environment. Management did nothing about it until it was taken way above their heads, even then they are still allowing her to ruin the practice. Management is ajoke! And they don't pay holiday pay, and neglected to tell you that when you are hired."
bad,When I interviewed here I was really excited about the job opportunity that I have been presented. After training and being on my own for about 3 months I learned that there is basically no support for you to do your job well. I was left feeling like I couldn't do my job; like I couldn't be a good nurse anymore
bad,At the time most of the management had no knowledge of imaging or mammography. The quality was poor and I did not feel good about working there.
bad,The hiring manager wants to apply call center culture and talent leading to employees that needs lots of training and seminars first before they can match the skills of professionals. The owners were shortchanged its a pity.
bad,"High Nurse patient ratio. They did not sign the union contract anymore; then, they do not care about wage rise. Often RN work without CNA. RN s Burnout is frequent."
bad,The provider I worked with was let go and I was a casualty of war Tenet policy is to help their established employees maintain thier position in a situation like this by transferring out to another office with the assistance of management well my manager did not care about my situation I put in 5 request got no response from anyone I woyld ask my manager questions all she would say is I dont know but Tenet  policy is to make sure that you maintain employment internally we get first preference all thease open positions but no one will offer me a current employee a job but i was give a letter today with my termination date on it i have a family that depends on me
bad,The patients were a variety of ages from infants to the elderly in the projects of New Orleans. The physician was extremely helpful in the day to day care of the patients
bad,"I enjoyed working inn the Nephrology field and Cardiology field, lot of new terminology to learn, I enjoyed the patient contact and assisting the family with there daily needs."
bad,"The company in general is a JOKE. You do not get good benefits, you have to use your PTO for EVERYTHING. The company in general does not value their employees.there were times my office manager would be in tears because of the work overload. HR does not make you feel protected. Confidentiality is not confidential. I was there a year and I must say the company was not worth the stress. You work Ot and they try to send you home early to keep their numbers intact. There are better companies out there who value their employees. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM."
bad,"This company could give to heart beats about their employees. They are not fair, there is favoritism , racism, cliques.  Coworkers sleeping with each other . Management sleeping with coworkers.  Dont have a real problem HR will not do a darn thing.  I would not recommend working here to my enemy. "
bad,"Employees were very unhappy. This make the day to day operations, promotions and collaborative work difficult. Everybody was concerned about the risk of loosing their jobs or not getting a raise and this carries into the day to day operations."
bad,These facilities are consistently under staffed and over worked. This was the second tenet hospital I have worked for and it was the same. Old equipment and not enough staff.
bad,"This pharmacist position is advertised as full time, however, they do not have a full time position available. It's just per diem."
bad,Very busy environment. Good peers and no room for advancement
bad,I would give it a negative amount of stars if i could. The supervisor R. L. drives away everyone and plays favorites. Pretty much everyone leaves or is trying to leave
bad,"The advent of new healthcare policies and procedures has made it difficult for companies who rely heavily on government reimbursements to find a path to profit. Certain pieces (hospitals) in the Tenet infrastructure are not yet acclimated to the new face of healthcare. These are not good places to be. Be prepared for long hours, no regard for personal life, no pay raises, dwindling benefits, and employee dissatisfaction."
bad,Employees are expected to work with minimal direction. Management gives vague instructions and minimal praise. Goals are unclear and tasks are assigned last minute with extremely short deadlines. Very stressful.
bad,"New management has been hired and morale is down as well as friendliness. This used to be a place I loved to work but since they have let inexperienced people into management, it has gone downhill."
bad,This is a stressful job. What makes this a stressful job is knowing that you won't receive any benefits and hard workers goes unnoticed. There are no rewards and the level of respect from your management and other staff makes it that much harder. Waking up everyday going to a dead in job was the hardest part of this job.
bad,"Hi pressure work environment, often hostile.  If problems needed to be addressed they were either ignored or staff was told that they could look for work someplace else if they were unhappy.  Improperly trained management in my department added to the stress. Concentration on moving patients in and out, little on patient care. Many of the doctors treated staff, ALL staff, as ignorant and lazy.  Little appreciation shown to the staff for hard work.  Low employee retention."
bad,"Over ten years of diagnostic medial imaging in high risk, critical care, operative, post-operative and emergent settings. "
bad,You really have to like the health care field to be able to work there. I have stayed the 11 years for the patient's. I work on a surgical unit and it is very fast paced unit . You have to be able to handle multi-tasking as well as keeping up with everyone on unit and all family members at all times in case there are needs . As well as taking care of Doctor's needs at same time .
bad,Our new CEO made the decision to send all Finance jobs offshore to Asia so that he could receive his $30 million bonus by saving the company money.  We found out Nov 13 and on Nov 18 they brought in the asian team for us to train.  First we are told we are fired and then we are told we have to train the people who are taking our jobs.
bad,The work environment is horrible. Morale is always low with a lot of turn over within a year.  No real job training. Very paper intensive.  Out dated and numerous systems.
bad,"continued repeated ethics violations, poor management, poor vision, poor compensation, massive ongoing staff layoffs - the company is circling the drain - don't work there."
bad,"Love the work and the majortiy of the surgeons, residents and OR staff. Only place in Missouri performing CS/HIPEC. Veerapong is fantastic.  Not a fan of management or HR department."
bad,Lots of Chiefs for a few Indians in the Dallas area Market. High Employee turnover rate.  Constant job overdrive expectations.  Poor communication and interaction from Management.
bad,focus is on profit not care ... management is terrible .. most need to retire
bad,"Management laid off due to healthcare cuts.  2 biomeds in large hospital working endlessly to keep up with the large equipment demands.  Doing our best to provide safe effective equipment for our nurses, doctors, and surgeons to use on a daily basis."
bad,"Long hours working during the day up to 100 hours a week, lacking positivity and no room for advancement"
bad,No growth opportunities. Patients are not very high acuity so very experienced RN might lose skills.
bad,Awful work place-enviroment management is allowed to bully the staff .Frequently firing without even investigating situations.Absolutely horrible!
bad,"Poor execution of organizational services. Multiple staffing challenges, lack of training, quality is in jeopardy and clinical care is declining. A once premiere organization is now gone 😢"
bad,Bosses believe that being bullies and threatening you will get more work out of you. So much turnover and they have not realized why. Maybe the big bosses should get some leadership training.
bad,"This hospital is behind the times in more ways than one. The employees who stay there do so because they are set in their ways and have become accustomed to poor management, low morale, and terrible workplace culture. Lots of negative and disgruntled employees. New management tries to make improvements by trying to implement policy changes according to evidence based practices, but those who have worked there the longest are in control and revert to antiquated ways. Not to mention that the entire hospital needs a facelift and new equipment to go with it."
bad,"Abrazo Scottsdale does not support nursing.  Administration does not listen to any safety concerns or staffing concerns. Equipment outdated, beds with no alarms, no follow through on concerns.  Management not suited to be in management."
bad,Company has great benefits but they do not care about their employees.  Went to management and human resources regarding work load that was on the workers and but no changes were made.  Working there was miserable.
bad,"Poor communication, poor training, heavy workload when working the floors, must batch patients to keep from getting behind,"
bad,Tenet Health does not know how to take care of their nurses.  Doesn't provide nurses with a sense of security.  Hospital needs remodeling due to hospital being around for 30+ years.  Quality of hospital not acceptable.
bad,no life outside of job. poor management. not the best food in the cafeteria. pay was not bad.
bad,"Worked a busy icu, covering both icus'.  The hardest part of this job was working 32 hours in two days. The most enjoyable part of the job was , I had the rest of the week off."
bad,A night at Brookwood Medical Center was very unorganized. We was always under-staffed. Poor management due to management being inexperienced and unprofessional. I always had to take care of a large amount of patients by myself
bad,"There is a huge difference working at a for profit institution vs a non for profit. I was taught to care for people mind, body and spirit. This company doesn't have patients nor their employees best interest in mind yet they are making record profits and buying out sinking medical facilities by cutting or reducing staff in all nursing areas. I have never worked where moral is so low. It truly is sad to see what they 're doing to nursing as a profession. Med/surg ratio of 8:1, flex off, no on call pay for floor nurses, etc. If i had to base nursing off how this hospital runs their operations, I would have never chose nursing as a profession. I tell students it's never to late go change their mind. Nursing in institutions is brutal, uncaring and killing our profession. Tenet is guilty of this killing."
bad,"always something to do, toileting patients, setting up meals, community group meetings, patients safety"
bad,Grossly understaffed and furthering education was discouraged.
bad,Very little guidance regarding career pathway or development. Poor annual revenue performance is resolved by cutting labor to meet financial goals. Finite solutions for systemic problems leads to high turnover.
bad,"Management would call out salaried employees for time spent at lunch if more than 60 minutes, or arriving 15 minutes late/leaving early, but would not acknowledge when extra effort or time was put in. Salaried employees are meant to put in extra time on occasion, but for example, employees would be called out for leaving 15 minutes early (and not skipping out on any responsibilities) despite having arrived early and working through lunch the same day. It was not good for morale. Upper Management and HR had a façade of being available or caring about employees as people, but when push came to shove, their was little support. On more than a couple of occasions, documented evidence was provided to HR and Upper Management which showed the need for additional or better resources, but they stated they would make no changes. Concerns of retaliation are often disregarded. Several reports were made to Upper Management about concerns, but they were only shared with the person in question and the behavior did not stop. The ongoing behavior would then be reported, but it appeared appropriate discipline was not given as the behavior never changed."
bad,"While I enjoyed the actual work and believed in the company mission, Tenet did very little to motivate or encourage employees to reach their full potential, or provide any continuing education or workplace education. "
bad,"The staff are not very nice to each other and team work is lacking. Standards are not followed and when these issues are reported to Executive Leadership, there is no follow through or correction given to the employees."
bad,"we have been sold to numerous companies and are in a run out situation with little communication, or assistance.  very stressful work environment for the health insurance division in phoenix"
bad,"Cost-cutting has cost the company good, experienced personnel and job security here is tenuous as my team was gutted, without warning, about 5 times resulting in instant layoffs and rearrangements only to be shifted back to the original lineup; rinse and repeat."
bad,I learned what I am looking for in my next role by the mistakes made by leadership in both Tenet and Conifer.  The company is lacking strategy and leadership directives as well as an integrative culture.
bad,"Workers here are more concerned about their pay and schedules than they are about delivering quality patient care. Work environment is hostile and tense and if one tries to point out or fix ongoing errors, they get railroaded into silence and are seen as an outcast for trying to change the culture."
bad,I was responsible for multiple ambulatory surgery centers. Not just the one center that I was the administrator.  I traveled to each center each month and was in constant contact with them.  Tenet at the time was attempting to increase its presence in Florida with additional ASC acquisitions.  This created an imbalance in work/life happiness.  They needed more people in Florida to assist with acquisitions.
bad,"You have to make the best of any circumstance. Take from every job the good, and experience you receive and move forward toward the goals you have set for yourself and family. Let God lead you in all things and matters. No company is horrible, Every company has it's pro and cons. You must first find out what you want to gain out of each company and go for it."
bad,I enjoy all my co-workers. They are a pleasure to work with.  Some of the doctors and NPs are amazing. The management is horrible. The float pool is horrible. The lack of communication is the worst.
bad,"PBGMC dialysis is run by St. Mary's Medical Center. They hire you for 4 10-hr shifts, but like any hospital dialysis department (a.k.a acutes), there is no such thing as a ""shift""; you get to go home when the last patient is done, which means, you could end up working anywhere between 10-20 hrs a day. No life balance there! "
bad,"(Mon-Wed-Thurs)  Round in hospital before office hours"
bad,Too many higher ups getting paid the big bucks for standing around while others bust their humps & barely get by... Too many politics involved.
bad,"RUN:"
bad,I liked the job itself. I learned a lot about hospital supplies. A lot of children today suffer from bad illnesses. I can say for myself that I've help them in a lot of positive ways.
bad,"Long hours, no help, hard to take lunch with only 30mins while working a 12hr shift"
bad,The job is really a enjoyable job however the managment does not back there employees. Must have thick skin and be able to just go to work and punch out.
bad,"Overall, the job was good. My immediate supervisor was great, but the rest of the administration was horrible. There was clear favoritism and little to no room for any advancement. The compensation is not great but not the worst I have seen."
bad,"Change is good, too much change is a sign of things going downhill.  This company is taking good, loyal employees and burning them out with the stressful workloads and unprofessional leadership at the top level."
bad,"I would not recommend this as a great place to work very stressful, not appreciated.  People were very friendly and demonstrated great teamwork.  Very low salary, with no room to grow"
bad,"Working for tenet  was a great experience, I worked for them for 2 years and I learned a lot in my trauma registrar position. The management there wasn’t the best but the people I worked with were amazing people."
bad,"If you need service hours this is a good option. If you're too young to get a job, this can be a good reference. The actual job is pretty boring and you don't really do much. Didn't really enjoy it."
bad,"I have not worked at this facility in many years. Do not know if they are still in business. I was able to learn management skills."
bad,We no longer had the same vision. my number one priority will always be my patient and satisfying them. At the point that it became clear to me that Patients needs were not always top priority to everyone else i needed to leave.
bad,The hospital is very understaffed but we do the best we can I guess. Tenet owned the hospital I work for and during he time I was there I had no complaints they di the best that they could.
bad,"i did not enjoy the work location the management is not up to par with competing hospitals, there is no room for growth and the food from the cafeteria gave me the runs"
bad,"the most enjoyable part of my job is to feel like its a second home for me, you grow to feel like a family. You learn a new job skill from co-workers."
bad,"Managers and leaders are exceptionally overpaid. They have no real interest in helping improve the company or building a positive culture. They play favorites.  Time for a change at the top.  The CEO did a good job turning the company around, but that time has long passed -- and it's time for new leadership at the top. Corporate HR is a mess, although there are some good people in the ranks. There is a new chief HR officer who we all hope will fix HR ands make it and make it smaller and efficient.  The person in ""charge"" of culture has no clue what it means and needs to be moved into a different role, away from HR, or into a hospital. Horrible open work environment makes it difficult to get real work done, or have any privacy.  It is undignified and colorless. Literally colorless."
bad,"Terrible place to work. Decent pay. Worst management imaginable. Not much else to say, not a very friendly place to work, at least in the corporate offices."
bad,Nurses dont work as a team with the nurse assistant. Long day. Too much work. Works on weekends and holidays was hard.But at the end was a nice job.
bad,I worked at SFMC during the last few years that the NICU was open. The management was like a rotating door. I learned much from the nurses I worked with and am still very thankful for the experience I have gained from working there.
bad,"overall, this company is a friend environment and allows staff to take short breaks. There are both pros and cons that come with working for this company"
bad,"I like knowing the CEO, CFO and CNO on a personal basis. I have worked there over 6 years. We were recently bought by Tenet, one of the largest healthcare providers in the US. We lost that ""small"" feeling. "
bad,I was a student there and the school did not have any accreditation and misrepresented itself. I have not had a good feedback about the school.
bad,"very busy , long hour. i worked in the er as a patient rep . i learned a lot ."
bad,"The job was intense, unstructured and management really did not support staff"
bad,"Sterilize medical equipment, tray set up for surgery, work in decontamination, and deliver trays to surgery rooms as needed."
bad,Not much job security or room for advancement. There was a lot of miscommunication among co-workers and management and absolutely no stability with work flow and rules and regulations.
bad,busy everyday
bad,I worked for Frye Regional Medical Hospital(Tenet) twice. The first time I worked for them I really enjoyed working there(1984-1994). The second time I worked for them I enjoyed it up to a point. I had some health issues and had to take a couple of weeks off. I was okayed to go back to work without restrictions but human resources and the Industrial Dr.. told me that I had to take a 6 month sick leave. The Industrial Dr. had never seen me and has never seen me to this day. The Dr. that released me was a neurologist and the other one a GP. I questioned whether I was going to be allowed to return at the end of the six months and was told that it would depend if there were any openings. This is how they get rid of their older workers. I am not the only one that they have done things like this too. I have tried to go back to work there and they tell me that I am eligible for rehire but HR will not send my applications to the various departments that I apply to. How do I know that? I have called the departments and have been told they have not received my application.
bad,Very Clickish in the Boca Raton office. Could be a Great Company. Some workers are Awesome. My Supervisor was somewhat inconsistent and untrustworthy. Which makes for a bad work experience. Sometimes demeaning to her subordinates.
bad,"BHS physician Network/ VHS Physician Network or Valley Baptist Physician Network or Harlingen Physician Network. They go by all those names. In my personal experience I enjoyed the opportunity to learn and strengthen my skills. Working with a specialist was an amazing experience (when it comes to learning). Dr. would answer questions and teach if you took initiative. But by far management and work environment it has been the worst. Office manager has no professionalism and creates an hostile environment. There is no leadership. No authority. Favoritism. Poor communication. No training you basically learn on your own and will learn a lot, but only if you take your time to do so. Unprofessional work environment overall. Work load not distribute fairly. Either you do everything or you do nothing and be on your phone. Gossiping and negative environment created by office manager leading to conflict between coworkers and Dr.  Good pay for medical assistant in RGV. Good insurance. PTO. No holidays paid. Everything comes from PTO. No job recognition. If working in this specific location be ready to go into horrible management."
bad,"I really enjoyed the local team. However, the corporate office leadership is not at all what I expected. The lack of respect for clinical staff and unrealistic expectations were disappointing."
bad,There was no training. I had to either know the information for myself or figure it out on my own. The communication was non existing. I learned nothing at this job only the tools that I came to the table with. The hardest part of this job was to learn as I go with no guidance.
bad,There was a lot of competition at this workplace. This company was unfair to employees in many ways specifically employee benfits and parking privledges that I know of. The situations of favortim on the job halts the even playing field as it relates to performance.
bad,"After being at Tenet for almost 2 years I learned that each team had it's own culture and before I left a new Director came on board with hopes to change that. Good luck!! My team was terrible. The manager was NOT a leader or a good manager. She was passive aggressive and heavily favored one employee and even had a pet name for that employee. She allowed and encouraged another employee to snitch on everyone. The manager did not want anyone to work together or all of us as a team. She seemed to enjoy keeping us separated. Any ideas were typically shot down unless her favorite employee suggested something. "
bad,It was easy to get along with the fellow coworkers and to ask for help when needed. There was a bit of turmoil with the management at the time I was there which resulted in layoffs of which I was a part of.
bad,"Typical hospital environment, no support from upper mgmt. and co-workers who only report negative things to mgmt. and do not help each other."
bad,"From my experience, Tenet Healthcare does not take their employees satisfaction into consideration when making decisions. The benefits they offer are not competitive with other healthcare companies, and there is no sense of job security."
bad,"Since Tenet took over it seems to have gotten worse...didn't think anything could be worse than Vanguard.  They don't pay enough, equipment is decades old, management is terrible and no respect for their employees.  It is one of the worst places you can work!!  The only thing good is most of the co-workers but like all places in nursing....they have the bullies that go unpunished and the managers that need to go but somehow keep their jobs."
bad,No attempt to accommodate or keep their employees. We are short staffed in the ED and ICU and all other floors.
bad,"Again, gained invaluable experience while working at two Tenet facilities, yet when I needed help due to mental and emotional issues, I was terminated instead of offered help. They filed a complaint with the Board of Registered Nursing, which resulted in my voluntarily surrendering my license in 2011. This has placed me in the position of having to change careers late in life."
bad,the people are ok the politics are the problem. there is no backing for the security officers
bad,"I will never work for this company again. The tense environment was very uncomfortable, in part due to numerous changes in upper management. One executive regularly acted in a hostile manner. Cursing and stomping around in our open concept office area seemingly unaware that others were nearby. I would receive texts/emails after hours and on weekends from another executive. Never a ""please"" or ""thank you"", just the expectation of an immediate response."
bad,"Benefits are good. No inside advancement as they hire from outside. More often than not, the focus more on policy and profit not patient care or employee satisfaction."
bad,I'm in need of a different scenery. The job was very demanding standing and walking for 12hrs gets to be too much for anyone. I enjoyed working with some of my coworkers.
bad,I learned a lot in the 9 years I worked.  I was able to work in different departments which kept me interested in learning more things.  I was very intrigued working in the Main OR in which I saw a lot.  My final position was with Employee Health.
bad,"Physicians screaming at staff in front of patients"
bad,"Pharmacy department is understaffed, but the director relies on belittling the staff if they bring up any concerns and demands that everyone be capable of working overtime all the time. The morale is horrible here, and I see this job post every few months so I doubt it has changed since I worked there."
bad,"I did learn while there the art of computer charting and charging. Management  is pretty snarky, make promises they don't keep.. It was a pleasant fulfilling job working a shift with your co-workers who became friends."
bad,"Night shift was very rough, never able to find CNA's when needed. High pt/RN case load. Co-workers were always willing to help out. No stable management. Massive amount of charting. Loved my patients"
bad,"very rarely do you have what you need to do your job effectively"
bad,The company will not hear your opinion and will take actions regardless if they are wrong with their decisions
bad,under my first er nurse manager was treated like an equal.i was given responsibility equal to my skill set. when they fired thatmanager for reasons unknown new manager took all responsibility away from techs and their skill sets and regulated them to nothing more than stockers of supplies and gofers
bad,"No communication between departments whatsoever. Seems so inappropriate, even dangerous for patients. Not the way I was accustomed to operating. Management was a joke as well."
bad,Most of the people was nice to work with. But if some ever got upset with you or thought you was wrong then you wasn't treated as part of the team. I prefer enjoy going to work but I got to where I didnn't want to go.
bad,Tenet cdi management is sub par with respect to standards of the profession. They follow an ultraconservative policy and the management especially the coding is insecure and mostly intends to protect itself
bad,"I work with Tenet Healthcare for 2 years(2013-2015) at their Delray Medical Center Facility as a Nursing Assistant it was not a good experience at all the floors were so heavy I would come to work on some days and I would have 15-17 patients to attend to, the management safe were very cold didn't feel as if they cared anything for me, I felt as if I was simply a number to them that was dispensable at any time. The place can't retain staff its a revolving door of Agency workers who get one taste and never want to come back again, but if there's one thing I can say about this place is that the people I worked with were very nice and I did learn a lot from working here so for that i thanks them."
bad,"Tenet is different. Depending who you are things are different for you. i didn't enjoy who i worked with, but in the end i left."
bad,"I've been in better environments than tenet. The midwest in particular boast of some of the most well organized, technology advanced systems. Tenet in my experience is primarily profit driven. They got rid of nursing assistants in my hospital. That speaks volumes. They do not incorporate the voices and needs of people who actually perform the work."
bad,"Management: vindictive, hospital create false write ups to stop transfers. If you resign because of an dispute or allegation you will be put on a do not use list nation wide. Employees have been escorted off premises after 30 years of service. Union members get demoted until they voluntarily resign."
bad,"I have worked in this Tenet facility for over ten years and always been satisfied that benefits and salary were compedetive even through the constant trimming over the years.  The past two years have gotten progressively worse with forced time off, union involvement, delayed if at all raises, and benefit cuts. Morale has taken a serious hit.  Although I enjoy my job as an EMR analyst recent and rumored addional reductions in force are causing me to rethink my options.  If the company were barely surviving, I could chock it down to everyone doing thier part BUT as we just invested almost 2 billion in taking over another health system, I doubt that to be the case."
bad,work 40 hours a week multi task when ask to do several things by mgmt.
bad,"Poor management, never any positive feedback, but a lot of negative feedback. Very low morale. The most enjoyable part is patient interaction. The hardest part is explaining to patients why they can’t get things they need."
bad,A typical day at work includes a lot of drama with the nurses. Most of the people working here seem like they genuinely dont care for their job. This place is a nasty hospital i wouldnt come here for a common cold.
bad,"Co workers are wonderful, administration is failing. Seems smallest things are harped upon, while major issues continue to get worse. Patient and employee safety are sacrificed to ""save the budget."" Would not recommend to others for healthcare or employment."
bad,Directors rather have people they can underpay and have poor management than a well paid people with managerial skills.  Managers are very closed minded and the amount of unnecessary micromanaging is just overwhelming.  You get thrown work from supervisors and managers when they don't want to do their job even though it is not part of your job description
bad,Management is top down and hostile when staff or manager's submit ideas or demonstrate workflow or process errors. There is a corporate mentality that administrative or centralized subject matter experts  should not be questioned in matter of hospital policies or procedures.
bad,GI procedures on 10-20 cases per day.  I did pre-op and then worked PACU most of the time by myself.  Little help from management when needed.  Culture was one of cliques.
bad,Work was not respected and had no voice in the department.Lack of respect for employees by management. Bullying and retaliation by management.  St. Mary's Medical Center only.
bad,"I believe most of the management has left; however, the department rolled over 3 times in my tenure."
bad,"time consuming a very fast past place to work."
bad,"Work day:"
bad,The Tenet PMO office is ran by a completely insane black woman who thrives on hostility and aggression. She encourages teammates to compete with eachother and rat eachother out. She feels this contention will drive an aggressive and competitive environment. In reality she is a crazy control freak who has seen a complete staff turnover in the past year. It's truly amazing she is still there creating all of that hostility in her department. I actually saw her berate another employee in front of a bunch of other employees. She enjoys ripping into people and disrespecting them. Public humiliation is both not professional or called for in any environment.
bad,"The clinic I worked in was just bought out by Tenet. Corporate need to better train and communicate their new clinics/employees. Set aside a training class in person rather than just online to help answer questions or problems within the clinic. Their computer systems always have some type of problem. You have to call the IT guy all the time which isn't there most to the time. Some of the co workers and physicians are nice. Others, just say watch your back, Seriously. Management, most of time not available because they're always ""Always"" away in a meeting. When they are there it seems as though they're running around with their head off. Yes, it is a very busy clinic and for some MAs and their providers they don't get a lunch when available."
bad,"Working at Tenet was good. Good hours, great pay, great benefits and insurance. The doctors I work for are awesome to work for. They are like family to me."
bad,"Greeting"
bad,"Great executive position to oversee multiple campuses for Tenet hospitals within Detroit Market. It was unfortunate that Tenet executive Leadership did not hold hospitals accountable for various metrics. In addition, more than $541 million was paid in government fines, which contributed to the overall net loss for 2016 at $192 million. This resulted in a mass reduction in force action for February 2017. "
bad,"love saving lives ,just too many need to be saved and not enough worker to help out ,always over worked, you will  go in happy and come out with your mine all over the place"
good,"Pleasant to volunteer there I assist a great team of women. Learned"
good,Working at Tenet in the ER was stressful and busy all the time management at the time was the worst. If management was better and had some type of control over the er it would be a grate place to work.
good,"Working at this company made realized on why I left Corporate America in the past and become Self-employed.  The Immediate Supervisor is an Egotistic. Considering the fact that all they placed her in Charge of my Department is due to the fact that the company uses their Department Manager to oversee more than one office at a time in different locations.  The Human Resources does not work with you and your concerns and if you speak up asking for help help, they take retaliations against you "
good,I enjoy working at tenent it is a satisfying place to work I enjoy helping staff and patients but need a full time position with benefits.
good,"One does  not feel job security and there is no one to support, back you up or fight for you. will not advise one to work for company."
good,"great job, great people, gave me great possiblites to move up in the company."
good,"A typical day at work is filled with diverse responsibilities, many meetings and putting out fires."
good,"I truly enjoy working in the Acute Care setting, and have become passionate about my career over the last 19 years. From my patients, I continue to learn something new everyday. I enjoy collaborating with members of my Rehabilitation team, and working with all of the nurses, doctors, and ancillary staff. "
good,"I should have known better after seeing my supervisors work 48 hour shifts because of staffing issues - but I stayed because the money was right and I liked the ER experience. The nurses are mostly contracted workers who could care less about the hospital OR its reputation of care. Some of the doctors in ER were fantastic, true patient advocates, but most were just trying to keep up with their patient load. The respiratory department was severely understaffed for the levels of care needed in critical units. Lots of underachievers here, scary loads of responsibility, but the money was good."
good,"I was overworked, 12 hours a day or more 18 to 22 patients to clean, feed, bath and check in and out. Sometimes I would be the only PCT on the floor. It was very stressful for me as well as the patients. Since I worked there, management has changed hands and I heard it has gotten better."
good,"I am currently an NP at a tenet owned hospital. I have worked there for almost 10 years. It used to be a great hospital. Everyone worked as a team. The nurses were happy and management was supportive. Now it has turned into what I can only assume is a failing hospital. Nurses are unhappy and leaving, we are always under staffed. Our patients are leaving to go seek care at other institutions. Our ED is a mess with almost no experienced nurses working down there anymore, it's probably unsafe. Management has cut a lot of positions leaving everyone to feel like their job is no longer secure. I don't know how other tenet facilities are run but the hospital I work for is not what it once was."
good,A fantastic group of professionals to work with. Management is questionable within the radiology department
good,"I usually write business and bio cards, and I have learned how to work with people in a team and individually. The hardest part of my job is balancing everything."
good,Loved the job and met a lot of nice people.  Some of the staff is very friendly.  It's small so your meet a lot of hospital employees.  
good,"A liaison responsible for strategically planning and implementing outreach efforts focusing on physicians, community groups, and other potential referral sources in the hospital's target markets. Consistently meet company standards for increasing the number of Admissions, Surgeries and outpatient visits per month. Emphasize sales objectives based on market assessments and physician needs, as well as oversee the maintenance of good account relationships and the development and implementation of innovative selling ideas and methodologies."
good,"Great place to learn, high stress, poor management, no training, schedule is not resonable, over worked tired staff"
good,This review is about wellstar. Wellstar cut the hours of behavioral health techs leaving us in a bind to look for other employment opportunities. This is not fair for us.
good,I work for this company for years when I started my career. I did not realize how bad it was until I finally switched jobs. This company only cares about profits for them.
good,"overworked,under paid,manager never appreciated the work that was done and showed favoritism. I would come into work and the prev shift would leave things un done and we would report it to our manager but things never changed."
good,There is a lot of favoritism in this company. There are not sufficient opportunities for advancement for the average person. This is definitely a who you know company. The benefits are decent.
good,"It is a very tough work environment and it makes being a nurse probably more stressful than the job already is.  First, to complete any tasks small or large is tiresome because you are running around to gather supplies that are usually not kept together or worst you can not even find the items.  There are no supplies pyxis/room in the main ED.  The culture is abrasive and harsh from upper management all the way down to the staff.  For instance, you can get reprimanded in the nursing station by your manager or a coworker.  I don't think there is an understanding of professionalism and courtesy from upper management to the staff and this culture is cultivated at all levels of the organization at this particular hospital."
good,"It can be a pleasant place to work. The atmosphere is nice. Management is cool, favoritism can be shown depending on the department.  It tends to be more about who you know whether than your actual performance."
good,"Assistant director job at Retreat Hospital for the Complex care program was fulfilling and exciting and my first real experience with long term case management. This is how I transitioned to Kindred, the long term acute care facility in Richmond, the only one of its kind. I assisted the admin team staff with setting up the facility for JACHO and CMS approval. However, I missed the acute care case management and wanted to return to an acute care setting."
good,I used to work the 7p-7a shift three days per week. I learned that my time for working in hospitals and hands on patient care had expired. Management at HUH was horrible. My co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of my job was staying up at night and dealing with management in the morning. The most enjoyable part of my job was the night shift differential.
good,Come into office check schedule for that particular day and begin to start assisting patients. While working I learned more than I knew about insurance as well as different procedures and medical codes. Overall management could've been way better and more well put together. As a company they lacked in many ways. My co workers were wonderful and lovable. Kept a very friendly and family oriented relationship. The hardest part of my job was getting management to approve financial situations and having to see patients not be able to pay for important procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing and meeting different individuals with different cultural understandings.
good,I have been with Tenet/Conifer for 11 years.  There is no room for advancement and the salary is not competative.  They are in need of an overhaul to make the employees feel loved.
good,I and was working there 13 years and I was let go because of my ability to advance in salary. There was very little room for career advancement.
good,"Sorry, but this hospital is not very well maintained. It seems that everything is falling apart. They really need to get a new director of engineering before something bad happens. "
good,"I learned many things from this job including banquet server,cashier,customer service,and food service.This job gave me a very good experience in many job fields."
good,Gave them a 3 star due to the fact there is no organization with the company.
good,"Hello"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting the patients and making them happy.
good,A typical day at work was at times busy i always got the job done.
good,"you rarely got breaks and if you took them, it was frowned upon (onsite only)"
good,"Learned to solidify multi-diciplinary team work on a very tight, demanding schedule and incoorporate computerized documentation."
good,Overall a pretty good company to work for. Reviewing contracts against the system program giving expected reimbursement from Insurance Companies. Review issues from disputes and collections departments regarding claims that may have debit or credit balances. Problems may be with how the contract was loaded in the system. Coding issues may need to be reviewed if a code should have been taken off contract that is no longer valid. Trend accounts on updates and new plans for any possible issues. Review accounts regarding old issues for contract problems that are over 120 old. Assist plan specialist on their interpretation of a contract verbiage.
good,"If the management cared more for employees and patient needs than profit. We need more nurses and CNAs, better equipment and stable management. Also they need to pay CNAs and monitor techs more than minimum wage."
good,Culture of the community effects the quality of care. Understaffed. Nurses are brilliant however they are not supported by nursing administrative staff.
good,"Once Tenet came in, the benefits went down, less holiday, sick and vacation.  The health insurance was not good and that was the reason I left.  I did Physician Education in Medical coding, and I really enjoy my work but the raises fell below what I had to pay on the new insurance benefits as there was a larger deductible, and out of pocket payments, so the raises never kept up with what we now had to pay of our health care"
good,I have been working at this organization for approximately 15 years. During my time with this organization it has changed from staff input to no staff input on the day to day work assignments and how the duties will be delivered. This could feel like this due to this organization is going through a transition from one organization to another
good,"Great place to work, love co-workers, close to home and just far enough away to have a nice drive home. The hardest part of the job is trying to juggle my responsibilities with that of a few slackers who do not work well with others."
good,"management was bad for employees at the time of my employment.  There was no support if you needed help from the HR department. I did enjoy my job, but support from management is very important."
good,"Tedious work. People are very pleasant. Team leaders are great. Not alot of training for the area I was in, however they had just started the survey team."
good,This place has poor management and no chance for advancement.  Does not encourage employees to do well always looks for the worse in each dept.  Managers do not promote employee moral and would rather write people up instead of working for better solutions
good,"Working on specialty floor is great, however the overflow of non-specialty patients with the lack of staffing makes patient care and safety lacking. Very poor management backing."
good,"Wasn't a very friendly atmosphere. The work was consistent and I was able to stay busy which I prefer, however not very organized."
good,"I come in set up my work area, because we share our workstations with other co-workers that work different shifts. As soon as I clock in if there is a patient to register, I will register the patient with there parent and send them on their way to their out patient visit or short procedure visit. What I learn about in my position is that the healthcare insurances change on a daily bases, and also how to educate parents and patients on their insurance, financial counseling,collecting co-pays, deductibles, and co-insurance from patients that carry commercial medical insurances. My co-workers are one of the main reasons why I come to work, we work well together, as a team, and look after each other as a work family. Our management team sends out daily emails. I enjoy what I do, there is no hard part about the job in what I do on the daily bases. I been a Patient Access rep at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children for three years, I can do this job with my eyes closed, the only thing now is that I just need a bit more of a challenge in my work place. What I enjoy the most is coming to work to learn, teach or educate parents, patients, and fellow co-workers, also doing the best I can do to help my company reach their daily goals as well."
good,Very silo and no true strategy that leads the overall organization culture/goals. Very metrics driven and often it really doesn't matter how you get it - just get it done.
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of reviewing the schedule for incoming patients. I obtain vital signs, and medical history along with chief complaint before provider enters the room. I assist with pap smears and any in office procedures and collect blood samples via capillary and venipuncture. Management is alright for the most part and I enjoy my coworkers. There are no hard parts to my job and I enjoy the atmosphere of helping both sick and well patients."
good,"great learning experience, management likes to pool personal friends into dept an push out other personnel out kind of a good old boy scenario"
good,"alright place to work if you are just breaking into healthcare.  pay is low because you are new, but you do learn alot from the staff"
good,"Working for Fountain Valley Regional Hospital was ok we were located in a not so good area.  It got really hot during summer. It got busy for some of the girls but other no so.  I learned that there was favoritism with some of co worker and management.  Management was not so good they would record you while on the phone and if they could would use it against you harshly.  Instead of understanding and helping you.  Management and some co worker would gossip, and backstab others.  The hardest part was to go in try to do a good job and here the gossip and the stupid remarks that were said.  Some of my co worker there were really nice I miss them and really enjoyable to be with."
good,"The experience of learning new things daily. Working in a friendly workplace, enjoying helping others."
good,"Worked with the greatest people at night.  "
good,"It's a good place to work for BUT could have better management. Loved my co-workers BUT certain ones were the only one's being given ""special treatment"" ex: able to come and go at their convience, allowed to be out and not be penalized as such a dedicated employee who had valid reason for being out such as dr's appt's and written notes from the doctor for having to be out of work due to illness but would still be penalized. Management was not that great!"
good,This place was a great way for me to learn much of what I did not know regarding Mental Health. Working in a locked Mental Health Unit was a great challenge. Being on your gaurd at all times was tough. The patients are great but you never know when they will become irrate and out of touch with reality. It was tough when they would be zombied out due to medications. I always enjoyed when I was able to sit and have a normal conversation with the patients. The Nurses and Mental Health Workers I interacted with were a great team. We had to have a strong team to assist our patients for their success when they left.
good,The company was a great organization but the positions payed poorly with high demand on personal time.
good,"My typle day is working with workers compensation corespondece,& liens, to working the financial assistance dept. During my time I have learned how to handle not only the workers comp, but the financial assistance area, as well as filing of third party liens and lien releases. I have been able to work with the management in these areas as well as many of the co-workers in these areas. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with many of the co - workers."
good,The hospital I worked for changed to Tenet Healthcare a year or so after I left; I never worked for them. I have no opinion regarding this company; just filling in the blanks because I cannot exit
good,I Have no opinion of Tenet Health Care. Please allow me not to answer out of fear of employment loss. The overall company coulter is ok. Thank you for understanding .
good,"Tenet Healthcare has a popular reputation for being under staffed to maintin profitability. After working there I saw good places within to work that looked like they would actually be really good places to work. The team I was on was ran by some crazy woman who came from Deloitte and her hobby was firing people. We were the 3rd team she hired after the first 2 were all let go. My personal experience was terrible, Manage by fear etc. But again, I could see other areas looked to be OK places to work."
good,The company is good place for someone that does need any help. There is no additional training to advance your knowledge. Don't look to management for any guidance.
good,To work here you need to be able to speak up for yourself it’s fast paced not everyone is good to work with some managers are hard to deal with and if you go above them there is no point cause no one cares just get the job done. That’s the attitude. There is never enough staff so your always short and doing double work.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy going to my job everyday, though it is a bit stressful due to management and supervisors but they leave it up to you to do your job."
good,I was productive on a daily basis. I started off as a Imaging Coder for many years through Candelet when Tenet came in to take over I did get the opportunity to learn other types of coding and expand my skills.
good,"Working w/ Tenet a lot of the equipment is outdated, they made everyone pay for their own office supplies for several months. Unable to put money back into the hospital for improvements or updated equipment/technology."
good,"I joined Tenet 3 years ago in the hopes of advancing my career.  Unfortunately, there are no advancement options as a medical assistant and Tenet does not have a tuition reimbursement program which hinders me from going back to school."
good,Did not enjoy working at St. Louis University Hospital. I worked there many years ago and did not like the staff or the management. It was a very stressful environment.
good,The workplace was mostly activities unplanned. More you got to know the environment less likely was it for you to fail. All management was professional. Although lack of communication did cause problems.
good,Great benefits from tenet. Depending on the place of employment the work load can be overwhelming. The culture at certain places needs to be improved - which takes time.
good,Tenet loses a lot of people because of poor management.  They have people in positions that have no business managing people.  They will see whole departments turn over multiple times and never look at the manager as the problem.
good,It is a great hospital to work for to gain the experience with pathology. The group of people in the department are fun to work with and still are productive.
good,The work environment is going through many changes at this current time. With all the changes I would not recommend starting here until they work through some of their issus
good,Great Physicians bringing in cutting edge new procedures to keep up to date with the communities needs. Enjoyed learning the clinical side.
good,"The worst job I have ever had. Pharmacy  technicians were always under staffed and over worked. They actually had a ongoing contingency list they used to determine which of the techs would work be forced to work overtime and additional shifts. One tech has the responsibility of  pulling all the daily narcotics for the various hospital units, putting away the order, answering the phone lines, filling incoming prescriptions, filling incoming pyxis orders, and stocked out meds, refilling crash carts boxes, and code bags, and answering all incoming computer messages. This pharmacy only cares about warm bodies that can work like slaves and nothing else. In all honesty do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"
good,"I like working with the staff there. We all worked together very well. But respiratory, was not officially recognized on respiratory week by the director of the department."
good,"Register patients, review demographics, insurance, copayments,preauthorizaiton, charge entry. "
good,"Print: census by insurance plan and medical group, face sheets; fax face sheets to insurance co. and to medical groups; request authorizations, follow up authorizations; check voice mail and return calls; cover various areas for lunch."
good,"10 sales calls/day, 2-3 luncheons/week, attend health fairs, align with hospital reps to leverage relationships, enter data in salesforce, weekly report"
good,"A typical work day isn't bad, you reach out to various departments to get your job done."
good,"Low census was frequent, which you take a hit in take home pay or burn your vacation time in making up for the loss in hours."
good,"As a rehabilitation tech, you get to see people make a comeback from injuries, strokes, and surgeries; the most rewarding part of the job.  But when bad upper level management  is apart of a team it brings down the morale!!!! The learning of rehab techniques( traction, whirlpools, bandaging, gait training) was very fun and something you can take with you throughout life,"
good,"Tenet as a Corporation has a lot of positives, great systems and terrific employees.  Compensation program was average and employee benefits were somewhat competitive."
good,Very disorganized. Supervisors were under qualified and my coworkers and I were very confused about daily tasks to complete.
good,"Work very hard with no advance in position or awards. Very unprofessional people and non stop ""drama""."
good,"Ok but needs alot of work, very busy practice, need more team work, and more help, maybe some agency people to come in, and assist."
good,"I enjoy my co-workers, I work evenings and I dont feel like I can get my day started or even finished. I am looking for employment with room for advacnement.."
good,"Please are nice but Management shows favoritism."
good,Good people poor management. People of color don’t seem to be able to move up. Lots of politics. The company pays pretty and the facility is amazing. Plenty of places to eat without leaving the building and beautiful views. Work environment set-up is cube office style but very roomy
good,"Tenet is a great company to work for, however the managers give the company a bad rep. They treat the employees with no respect, I've witness office bullying and harassment. Often times people do not leave companies they leave managers."
good,Too relaxed. Hired PRN but never hours any until last minute.  Urban setting. Rude nurses. Poor Bedside manner in different departments. Unkept hospital.
good,"Work is fastpaced and exciting, I improved my skills at Tenet.  Management made a lot of bad decisions leading to the company's current malaise,  Lots of great people work here and it has a big family type atmosphere.  I was laid off after thirteen years of loyal service."
good,They have excellent benefits and there are numerous people that work there that have great skills. But there are certain people in management but don't take care of your staff and only look out for certain people. They're excellent staff that had a lot of experience but the new generation doesn't want to learn
good,Change is inevitable.  Working for a large corporation when you can be a casualty is a risk.  I need to make a change and improve my marketability.  I foresee an end to my role by the summer if I don't relocate.
good,"A poorly managed hospital with high expectations of its staff and minimal appreciation for the hard work. Large amounts of favoritism shown to the ""in"" crowd of employees by management."
good,"Management was ok.  Long working hours, The hard part of the job was working with floor manager and training them to use mandatory tools for screening and selecting appropriate candidates for hire. The candidates that were hired expressed there appreciation continuously  and became long term employees."
good,PCTs feel very much entitled to go about patient care and unit management as they may please. Will be very aggressive abusive and bullies toward nurses. No form of decency of respect toward nurses! that is the reason i decided to leave. Management was found 0% supportive.
good,Working for Tenet Healthcare proved to be challenging with my job duties as well with leadership. I made several attempts to apply for various positions to advance my career with this company and I was turned down each time. I was not provided with ways to improve work performance or guidance on what would make me an ideal candidate. The most enjoyable of this job was my ability to assist in the development of better ways to my job function.
good,"You can learn a lot"
good,"Conviently located near major highways, efficient  professional staff and very knowledgeable doctors and surgeons.  would definitely work here again if given the oppurtunity"
good,"Great company to work for but there wasn't a mangement foundation. There was no room for advancement. There was too much in office drama and that took away from employees getting the job done. Supervisors were undertrained, I even had to train my supervisor and after I trained her I was laid off."
good,A very good first job. Clean place. Friendly staff. Not enough staff. Not enough training but was nice to work with people my own age at the time
good,"Outgoing work place, co-workers fun and helpful. Management hands-on. Supportive of flexible scheduling (since i have other commitments) but hard to move to ideal day shift. Large Patient workload/ community made it possible to sharpen skills and be adaptable in performance."
good,"It's always a pleasure to truly connect with the patients on an emotional, as well as mental and physical level. I love the fact that we are healing the whole person here , not just their body."
good,A typical day at work for me is seening around 20 patients a day. The doctor teaches us new medical terms and procedures a day.
good,"When Interviewed I was told the job was full time with benefits but by the time  HR called to offer me the job, I was then told it was PRN no benefits. During my one year review I found out then that I also didn't qualify for a raise. Employee left and I was never even considered to take her place even though I had been doing her job all along. Very disappointed with the supervisor that came in Jan."
good,Low advancement opportunities and management interaction.
good,Management was poor and I was not prepared take over my tasks for my shift.
good,"Good pay, bad hours, some employees are nice and some aren't if you focus on your job you'll be alright."
good,"It was a great experience, but the management team had favorites which caused a little confusion."
good,management needs to get it together. Totally disorganized and they always do things and then think afterwards.
good,A typical day is a 12 hour shift interacting and giving care to various people. I learned how to manage people in trauma situations as well as communicate with colleagues.My co-workers were diverse but all dedicated professionals.The hardest part of the job is dealing with losing a patient.The most enjoyable part is seeing a patient leave the hospital better than when hey came.
good,Great co-workers / fast-paced environment / enjoyed working with the patients' families
good,"Nothing to add at this time. It provided income."
good,"Productivity is measured every month."
good,"A typical day at work involved receiving phone calls from hospitals as well as faxes about patients who were admitted into the ER and the information of the patients needed to be put into the computer via data entry within a timely manner. I learned how to create reports, send out proper e-mails and how to read certain medical documents from doctors. Management was a bit poor as they did not acknowledge those who worked and those who did not work to their best of their abilities."
good,"I feel that all patients deserve compassion, and I do not believe Tenet feels that way, although they exclaim they do. Money, money, money seems to be the big picture. They do not do anything special for the employees, in other words there are no incentives to stay with this company. I have been working with them in multiple offices since 2009, and i have seen more doctors leave this corporation, also employees. The only truly positive thing I can say is the benefits are awesome. I would like to see myself where not only the doctors, but the staff as well have some compassion for the pt care. I have learned alot over the past 13 years in the medical field. My typical day at work as stated on my resume included, checking in and out pts, scheduling, phones, collections, end of day reports, insurance verification, confirmation of appts, etc.The most enjoyable part of this job are all the compliments I have recieved from my patients. The hardest part of my job, was coming in everyday knowing that nothing positive was ever going to come from management. it is nice to be praised once in awhile from your superiors, as i did when i was an office manager. "
good,I was treated very unprofessional by my supervisor and really had no one to go to for help.
good,Hard work but a fine place to be. Professional atmosphere. Patients were all very nice.
good,"In the facility I work at,Hialeah Hospital, Management could use some adjusting. Most of my co-workers are unhappy with the recent changes i.e. increasing nurse to patient ration, especially that the employees are just starting to adjust to the new computerized charting. Employees are feeling burnt out."
good,They decided to eliminate one of the Supervisory positions and I had the least seniority. Was a fast paced high stress position and on call all the time.
good,"its all about getting the patient out of the ER dept , to the in patient bed and the next day its all about getting that same patient out and discharged so as to open up that same bed so as to get the ER patient out of the ER.....day after day.  Also you have to be very aware of the Press/Gainy scores your floor/hospital will get from the discharged patient cause that is how the hospital gets reimbursed....popularity contest, not how well were you educated on your disease process etc...just if the nurse or doctor was nice to you and gave in to your ever demands...even if they are contrary to a good health outcome...and computer, computer, computer...takes up a huge amount of your time"
good,Tenet is a good company.  There is opportunity for advancement.  Currently things are a bit disorganized and there is restructure going on.  Once everything is in place and settles down it should be a great place to work again
good,Management was extremely lacked on staff safety.  There were many violent patients and we often worked short staffed and/or the would continue to admit patients past what was safe.
good,"The requirement is 5 years ICU or ED experience for float pool, so that you can pay for certifications and wind up working 85% of your shifts on Med/Surg.  When you mention that med/surg was never mentioned in the interview, you get the response, ""It's adult services.""    The float pool manager advertises a Mazarati and actually delivers a Yugo.  Horrible position that costs the organization a ton of money in turnover."
good,"Great company, however many politics are involved. At the end of the day, you are working for someone else. Lots of opportunities to learn more each day and variety of EDU's are available. Good benefits."
good,Tenet was a good company to work for. Good benefits low pay. They are not competitive with their pay. Not keeping up with times. Degree is needed for fair pay.
good,"In the hospital the culture was much better when I first started. However, a lot of turn over changed the culture into a less collaborative environment."
good,"Benefits and pay could be much better. However, It's a friendly place to work. They have a 401 plan and a retirement plan. Management can use some improvement."
good,"Nurses pay not up to the market.."
good,"All areas of healthcare compliance are the responsibility of the Compliance Officers to implement and monitor. They usually cover at least two hospitals.  Multiple changes in Corporate Leadership over the last several years, some positions three times."
good,"Great work environment, family oriented. Tenet hospitals in Atlanta area were bout-out by Wellstar Healthcare Systems WHS. "
good,Corporate culture can be very stressful. Recent developments in the company is very disappointing. Many staff lost their job. many are anxiously waiting to find out the future of the company. Poor management costing many employees livelyhood.
good,"Benefits were great, work culture horrible. It was cutthroat and anyone would throw you under the bus in order to advance themselves. I must say I learned everything I needed to in terms of horrible hospital politics here. Everything is about the various metrics that that one person needs to meet, never about the patient or employee. They have a culture that those that do not provide patient care are better than those that provide patient care. That is just wrong in SO many ways....they need to Appreciate the hands that touch their client!"
good,job flexibility was great and overtime was available yet the raises werent much at all. You could grow there because cross training was available to thoses interested.
good,It was a good place to work people were nice and it was a great learning opportunity. Like all jobs there goods and some challenging days but overall a good place..
good,Fast paced environment. Great atmosphere of all for one and one for all. This hospital works together. Everyone here chips in to help out. There is a lot of opportunity here
good,Job is not hard to learn employee are nice. Manager is not professional and office director is not personable. No room for advancemennt
good,"This is the type of company where it really matters what department you work for."
good,"Initially a very clear focus with determined goals. This led to very successful implementations. Over the past year , acquisitions and political posturing has resulted in a loss of focus."
good,My average was to prepare everything from my mental note of what needs to be prepared whether it was cafeteria or patient dessert.  Then prep any cold items needed cafeteria stations.
good,I was able to utilize the knowledge that I obtained in my graduate studies.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with others from various backgrounds.
good,"Only there for a few weeks and was an unpaid intern, so I can't speak for the quality company."
good,I was surprised that I was offered this job.  I had no previous experience in transplant and had lots to learn which I did!  I was given the opportunity to scrub in and watch a surgery.  However the dynamics of the team did not lend itself to the responsibilities of the teamwork everyone attempted to do.
good,"Many unhappy staff at the time of beginning to work there. At the time of work, many upper management turn overs occurring. Good support from staff nurses"
good,Hard working and very professional.  Enjoyed the employees and the patients. Great learning environment and fast-paced.
good,"Hospital Admissions, ER admitting and financial Counseling"
good,"A typical day at Atlanta Medical, I prepare  the unit for the patients to come after their surgery. When patients arrive I take vitals signs, fax paper work to location, take accu checks if needed I'm at the bed side to assist the nurse with patient care. When patient has recovered I then take transport the patient to the location ."
good,"Draw morning round blood work."
good,"Usually scanned alone. I had a tech aide to help me but mostly in charge of doing everything myself which was the hardest part of the job. Co workers were very nice, helpful and easy to get along with."
good,"Medical surgical gives nurses a very well rounded experience. It is very fast pace and the nurses are highly skilled, From drawing labs, IV infusion, traction, and admission and discharge daily."
good,Unit secretary in day surgery at hospital. Co workers were very nice but supervisor was controlling and overbearing. Co-workers were extremely unhappy.
good,Run and refresh account receivable reports in excel.
good,Staff moral and teamwork during earlier years at this company were great probably because of being lead by a wonderful CEO. Times changed areas of the hospital closed towards the end of my time at this hospital
good,Where I was working my director was very family friendly and cared about me as an employee. She was also concerned about running the business which of course was her priority. The company itself used to be very good to work for. It seems now all they care about is money. I know money makes the world go round but there were too many layoffs and employees were always wondering if they would be next.
good,"High-stress, unpredictable, and short staffed although it offers major opportunities for learning; hardly any ancillary staff and limited resources for new nurses"
good,"Tenet is undergoing a significant amount of change. As such, changes impact employee morale. Also, there are no back-up plans when employees leave so their work ends up on your plate. Know what you are signing up for before you say yes to the position."
good,Nice work environment at a local hospital owned by Tenet. Good benefits and PTO. Tenet does not have a direct hand in the IT operations but we get the requirements sent from them.
good,"Fast past environment,  CONIFER ... a company Tenet uses for IT services is absolutely horrible,  they had no clue how to run the health plan business.. and so Tenet sold them off.  I worked for the Tenet Health plans and witnessed the carnage"
good,"horrible management and not organized "
good,Tenet Healthcare cares for the staff.  Lakewood Regional is a community hospital and the staff and leadership is caring and friendly.  The Medical Doctors (Hospitalists) are incredibly amazing and empathic.
good,"High Stress, but high reward. Must be a self starter and able to work independently to excel here. Very corporate culture, must be able to work within a very structured organization."
good,Anytime you have an opportunity to help women and children it's a blessing.  The work that is done at the Children's Hospital is simply extra ordinary.  I certainly would recommend this facility.
good,Same as Boca raton regional hospital.The culture was friendly and supportive.THe hardest part was the morning run since we had such a large volume of work.
good,Contract position worked 3 months only through temp agency voyage from December to January. In the operating room at atlanta medical center in atlanta georgia.
good,"Company went out of business. Day to day work load consisted of processing claims, answering phone calls, management was supportive and helpful, coworkers were team players."
good,"Typically busy. How to work better with others. Management needed to work better with employees. Workplace was great. "
good,The work culture at USC is OK.  It could be better if they pay more attention to their worker. The management team are average to good. You have a lot of middle manager that can make their decision without having first consult with an upper management.
good,Tenet was a very demanding job to work for.  They are not family oriented when it comes to family issues they are not understanding or supportive.  Management is allowed to do what they want
good,"Not a bad place to work, just wish it felt less corporate.  Administration has open door policy, which makes it easier to communicate.  Feels as if hospital is in a transition period"
good,It’s been over 15 years since I worked there. Tenet went through many changes that didn’t work out so much for me.  I wouldn’t go back.  Many people have left.
good,"Good place to work. I like the vacation package. The hours were long but co-workers and doctors were friendly. Fast pace work environment, on-call but very rewarding."
good,"St. Mary's is part of the cultural fabric of West Palm Beach, and has a rich history, so it is interesting from that angle.  It is a very busy, though, and is chronically understaffed."
good,Business Majors and Psychology are not a good fit when your managers lack the understanding of hi acuity and mental health. Company would push the census but cut back on staff. Leaving the unit unsafe for both staff and patients.
good,"My job was to buff, strip, and lay wax also top scrub floors in hallways and patient rooms daily. Light dusting and dust moping.every now and the I'll help take out trash from the hospital."
good,"when I worked here, it was very challenging especially as a fairly new nurse. management wasn't exactly supportive but the people I worked with were very supportive."
good,"Working with co workers and physicians to provide good patient care for all patients. "
good,"As an employee of the tenet healthcare services at St. Marys, I can say that it was very stressful in my department. The food and beverage department is a face-paced environment with a high turn over rate."
good,it was a great place to work and good people to work with..they have great food and everything.....i would suggest this place to anyone who wanted a job
good,"Our Commitment to Quality"
good,Would go back to same place if job was right for me and the company. Helping the patient and their families was the best part of my job. New equipment.
good,This is a fiscal focused organization.  Job/Work life balance is difficult.  Compensation is good.  Management is rigid and unrealistic.  Hours are long and demands are high.
good,"excellent people to work with.  generally nice and fun group.  low census many days.  manager nice enough,.  pay is horrible.  parking annoying since it in another building"
good,a very good job--can be stressful but the management and employees are nice--everyone is friends and quick to help- good benefits.  Everyone gets along and is respectful towards one another.
good,It is challenging but a good place to work . Management should get more involved with processes as they are still not very technology inclined and waste many resources.
good,Changing culture and operations to better focus on quality of care and realign their goals so they can be a successful healthcare organization.  Fostered growth from within.
good,"I worked per diem at tenet, an average of four shifts per month. sometimes more. There was more than one tenet hospital I was contracted for to give me more opportunity for work. I didn't really see much of the management because I worked the night shift. Much of the Tenet hospitals seem run down and old needing renovations. The best part was that the other employees seemed very helpful to us prn nurses that didn't know where things were."
good,"It was nice working here, the learning environment was great for someone like me who was a new grad. Leadership was also very good and supportive and I enjoyed it"
good,The work is fast and always changing. There is always some project that needs attention.  The daily PM schedule and the issues from the nursing floors will always keep you moving.
good,"lately (past 10 years) job security is not here. pts are always a challenge and can be exciting. depends on unit if there is teamwork. If you are pulled a lot - never get to develop a relationship with anyone or feel a part of the ""team"". there were some opportunities for job advancement."
good,"update minutes, prepare physicians files for approval during the credentialing process, ran physicians DEA for any malpractice or suspension of licenses"
good,"Enjoyed workplace, coworkers great to work with, team approach."
good,The job had its ups and its downs but honestly if it wasn't for the pay I would have left sooner. Management was okay (they tried to get us to change the culture of the kitchen when everything was working fine to begin with).
good,Employees did not have sufficient support from the upper management. What I've learned was that communication is truly a critical aspect in any work environment.
good,"At this facility I gained most of my nursing experience. I learned all about critical care and mother baby services here. This is a very high stress environment requiring multitasking and priority management, while still having good bedside manner."
good,"I have learned a lot from my management staff. It has helped me to hone my skills and grow as an employee."
good,Allowed me to grow and learn as a technician. I was able to experience new things and work alongside great people. 5/7 I would recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"Part time employment with excellent family to work for.  Lots of autonomy, and teaching others is a required skill.  Really enjoyed my time here. Basically set own schedule."
good,good workplace to start for fresh graduates. they are willing to train people. The workload is quiet heavy but you can always ask help or talk to your supervisor
good,"Great culture and work environment but business is on the downside."
good,"I worked there so long ago (15+ years ago), that I'm not sure a review would still be relevant.  This should not be a requirement on Indeed, but rather optional."
good,"I worked at Tenet 16 years ago, I had primarily good experiences while there.  I worked with a lot of people that were wonderful to work for and I remember with admiration. There was ultimately a change in management staff that was uncomfortable, however,it was simply people doing their job as directed by corporate leadership. That said, I would not hesitate to entertain employment at Tenet."
good,No opportunity for advancement but good people to work with. Better management team but company does strive to make it a better work environment. benefits are ok
good,typical day at work includes working short working a heavy work load. However I learned how to provide excellent care for all patients of respiratory disorders.
good,"It empowers health care for every one in every community by transforming financial and operational performance, enabling health care organizations to thrive."
good,"Productive, fast paced floor, enjoyable co-workers, clean working environment, placing orders in system could be made more user friendly along with Initial Admissions Assessment."
good,This was the first for-profit hospital I have worked at. It was okay but just a different culture than what not for-profit employees are used to. Things just work a little differently.
good,Large hospital with a float pool. Typical day is being assigned to a least one unit maybe 2 or 3. You very rarely assigned with any of your coworkers.
good,"Nice company to work for plenty growth in different department."
good,"enjoyable co-workers, very friendly place, I did learn a great deal there, and management was very helpful and listened to the employees on how to better ourselves as a company."
good,"Scrub Nurse or Circulating Nurse in large O.R.."
good,"Staff/Management not very open to change, was overall a decent place to work, could be a great place if there were some upper management changes"
good,"typical hospital job, feast or famin. Some clinical staff was nice, others were a nightmare. My fellow co-workers were great and helped in any situation they could."
good,"Nice place to work, Great place to learn.  Smaller hospital setting, so closer relationship with peers.  Team work concept."
good,"not the worst job I've had, but not the best. constant cost-cutting and heavy workloads, very limited rsources, I would not recommend it."
good,A typical day at work is fast paced booking info and answering the telephone.  I have learned alot working in the medical field and enjoy most of my days.
good,"I was a Med/Surg, and Oncology nurse at this facility. Wasn't there very long.  It was a nice hospital, but is is now closed."
good,"A typical day would start with getting report on my patients and then rounding on them with the previous nurse. From there I would get their vital signs, check their daily medications and start handing them out. This is where I learned how to be a nurse, I learned IV skills, how to deal with oncology patients, caring skills and just the duties of everyday nursing. My coworkers were fantastic, I couldn't have done it without them. The hardest part of the job was working without nursing assistants and the heavy patient load and on the other hand the best part of the job was also interacting with my patients."
good,"Technologists work as a team, positive energy in the xray dept. Radiologists are nice as well. good place to work. equipment can malfunction at times."
good,The leadership needs to pay more attention to the trickle-down effect decisions have on employees working on the front lines.  Remember that the greatest resource an organization has are the people that work there.
good,Fast paced and quick decisions on your feet. Fellow colleagues easy to work with at that time. Support from ER manager during heavy pt volumes.
good,"A typical day at work me working with a provider. I room all 20 patient's a day on my own. I need to provide my provider with each patient's last office visit notes and any lab, consultations and diagnostic results before the provider see's the patient. I  have to set up for any procedures done on our patient's and assist my provider. In between the rooming of the patient's I need to answer the phone take messages. I need to process all referral's for my provider. Give any immunizations needed for each patient. My co-workers are doing the same thing that I am so it is very hard to help each other out. If one of our provider's is out for the day that medical assistant will then offer to help the other medical assistant's if they can."
good,I enjoyed my time as a teacher. I loved to teach the kids about different types of experiments. I also involved the class in interactive activities.
good,Having the chance to work with psychiatric patients is very rewarding. The patients are very kind and definitely one of a kind.
good,Working in the hospital pharmacy was challenging. There is always something going on. Its much different than working in a retail pharmacy. The work is more in depth.
good,I worked at St Christopher Hospital for Children for several years and over several years have made advancements in my career. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping families find solutions with their health care concerns.
good,"Sometimes busy, sometimes not so busy. I learnt a lot on how health insurance works. Co-workers were all nice and friendly. It was an easy job."
good,Publix truly followed the founders desire of customer service and employee satisfaction.  Several opportunities for growth and development.
good,"can get pretty hectic, but overall the patients and staff are great. great work environment to work in but you have to make sure you are always on time"
good,"Managed busy medical facility for multiphysician practice.  Managed employees, resolved issues, and ensured quality patient care."
good,"Great hours, experience with taking care of mental health disorders, co-workers are always fun and work together as a team."
good,"o	Audited processed invoices and payments"
good,Hard work was not appreciated by pharmacists and speed was valued over accuracy.
good,love my manger and most of my teammates are terrific there are plenty of opportunities there but not without cost to home life or time invest
good,"The supervisors needs more training, and stop treating grown adults like children."
good,I have been with the company for 9 years in October. Great place to work and room for growth.
good,"moved and downsized to a down town dallas location. covered parking, lunch location on main floor. many places to relax during breaks."
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is making sure that my coworkers and also the patients are satisfied
good,"north shore and"
good,Happy go lucky kind of day when working here. My co-workers were the best. Hardest part of job was when patients would come or call after hours to get an appointment. The most enjoyable was filling the schedules for the technicians.
good,I loved this company but I had to relocate because of school so I had to resign
good,when i worked there it was always extremely busy and short staffed. co workers worked as a team.
good,One patient care technician is responsible for a large floor of very dependent patients. More help is needed to properly take care of this population. Coworkers were kind.
good,This job was a good job and I loved it. but what drew me away was not being staffed properly. I felt like I was overworked and not appreciated. What made it a good job was being around my co-workers.
good,Work environment has corporate oversight with many standardized processes.  OK place to work
good,The workers are nice there.  Everyone trys to help each other out.
good,"I would like another opportunity at this place."

good,"Tenet is a good company to begin your career in medical claims collections, to gain experience and grow within the company."
good,Good People. Patients Are Good To Work With. Management Can Be A Little Shady And Un-fair.
good,"Lead tech, not great at all! Small staff for radiology department. Some techs have no clue what they are doing."
good,Heavy Patient  load and  little pay. The best thing about this place is that they will give you a chance to work when you are fresh into the medical field.
good,"I was very busy with the orthopedic services so many of the changes seem to be on the out side. I learn a lot there, more than a surgical tech I was part of a great team."
good,"Sign in be at your desk at time schedule, follow on insurance claims file the day before, Review if any additional forms or information was needed to fax to insurance in reference to any insurance claim pending or iif we needed to add any diagnosis needed. Follow up that claims file were paid and if customers had secondary insurance that will pay balance left on claim."
good,DRMC is a great place for new professionals to grow into independent critical thinkers. I was a new grad RN there and was able to really develop as a provider and clinician there.
good,"Learned a lot, my first taste of the medical system very pleasant enviroment"
good,The people are fun work place. Have excellent benefits and the great bonus structure.
good,"As PBX: Responsible for accepting incoming calls and creating connections between incoming and internal lines."
good,"I've learned to work in a fast paced environment, adapt to change, and work well as a team player to accomodate to our patient's needs."
good,"Staff recruitment/ retention is a serious problem at this hospital and can be easily verified by their website job openings."
good,Good opportunity to work in a medical field at a high pace. Can be very stressful at times. Pay is competitive.
good,This was the same company just a different postion . Simular chalanges just more shift related duties
good,good place to have work as a tech and get your home care experience wtih flexible hours and time
good,Great people to work with but the pay just isn't enough to take care of a family.
good,great place to learn more about the field and grow your skills
good,Very busy company. Managers had open door policy. Co-workers were very friendly and understanding. 
good,"Love my co-workers, it is a great place to work other thank being a small hospital!"
good,"A typical day at work for me would have to be being able to assist to the patient needs, it's my job and instant to make the patient as comfortable as I can when I'm transporting them to any place inside the facility. It actually makes me feel good as a human being that I did a good job. The hardest part of the job would have to be when one of my co-workers are sick because then that means is extra work for the day but I do the best I can and just do my job. "
good,The different people that you would encounter each day. It was always nice to try to brighten peoples lives as you would walk down the hall.
good,Easy job to learn! Overtime was available. I liked working independently.
good,"My typical day at work, I collected inpatient and short procedure charts at various departments. Assembled charts in their proper order and prepared for scanning into Horizon Patient File system, answered telephone. I learned team work, organizational skills and detailed oriented. I enjoyed and got along with my co-workers.The hardest part of my job was it was'nt challenging. I worked well with management and was compliant with there request. I enjoyed the christmas festivities and the company picnics in the summertime."
good,"provided care at the bedside for patients that were critically ill, assisted with cardiac diagnostic and intervention procedures and recovered patients that had these procedures completed. Hardest part of job making care that all patient's were cared for in a timely fashion, enjoyed tthe day to day care of patients"
good,work is very demanding. I learned alot from working as a patient access rep. I have learned to use different computer applications. The only thing that is very difficult is that management is not on the same page.
good,An excellent Teaching environment especially for Traumas.
good,"Typical day at work was started at 7AM, as I went in early to see physicians that came in early to get their input before they went to their offices. This greatly helped me get a handle of the progress of the patient. I was due to start at 8AM. I learned the importance of being where I needed to be and when to get the information I needed. The hardest part of the job was not finding a bed where the patient wanted to go when they were due to be discharged. The most enjoyable part was a sense of a plan that benefited the patient, as well s the hospital.."
good,Hahnemann is a good teaching hospital with resources available to new nurses.
good,i learned alot about insurance and billing part of health care. women willing to teach me what i needed to know.and it was a very lively office
good,Their are not that many chances or forgiveness based on my experience with the tenet facility that I worked for. None the less I enjoyed my time working there as a phlebotomist.
good,"This position started out as a pilot position which I initally started. As the department grew my job duties became extremely difficult. Rules and job descriptions were changing weekly and at times daily. However, I stuck it out and stayed there a number of years. I worked at home after eight months in the office so I communicated with my co workers via IM on the computer. The hardest thing about this position were the constant changes and making sure to keep up with those changes. The most enjoyable part of this job is knowing I was the first one hired to start the department up and see what it grew into. We started out with four hospitals and by the time I left we had over 30 hospitals nation wide."
good,"I have had many new experiences at Tenet and have truly enjoyed my time there. I love the people I work with and the patients I serve. The work is often very busy and heavy lifting at times, but is rewarding at the end of the day. The hardest part of the job is often the news of health concerns to your patients. The best part of working at Tenet is making a bright spot in the day of your patients and getting them to smile or even laugh. Helping people is what it is all about."
good,Looking for other opportunities in Nuclear Medicine.
good,A typical day would usualy insist of restraining at least one out of control patient to thier hospital bed. Escorting usualy one or two patients from helicopters. The hardest part of the job was the out of control patients that had to be restrained to their beds. The most enjoyable was escorting patients from helicopter.
good,"I gain hospital knowledge and experience. I learned how the Medical Records department functions. Tenet showed me how to be prepared, professional, and a persistent worker."
good,"Work is hectic at times, but manageable my co-workers are very supportive and we tend to work as a team."
good,I love this job because i know that im responsible for making sure that the Doctors and Nursing staff have everything they need to save lives.
good,"Not the best mngt team, don't really care about nurses"
good,Tenet is a big organization with a union.  The work is fast paced.  They have a clinical ladder and opportunity for CEU's.  They hire within and promote within.
good,A very unpredictable and exciting work environment. Must be ready to expect anything and everything when coming into work. The work itself is no impossible task but management adds quite the bit of stress.
good,"I am satisfied with the culture of patient care and accountability, however the security of employment here seems tenuous. Each year the benefits seem to become less generous, as well as merit raises.  Cuts and changes to supplies and staff are continually made for cost savings rather than patient and employee benefit.  Leadership is out of touch with day to day operations on many levels."
good,Working here was a great place to be. I was not able to stay with this company when transitioning to my new discipline.  Others candidates (outside the system ) were chosen to fill the positions. Companies ponder why employees are no longer loyal. Funny...Employees ponder the same thing.
good,Workplace culture has negatively changed due to environment is cost reduction driven and lean business model is being implemented by interim CEO. The culture is moving towards customer focus and less of a priority is actual employee satisfaction
good,"Large hospital corporation that seemed to have a knack for caring more about budget and costs that actual employees.  Typical ""for profit"" corporation"
good,I don't know it is fast paced and you can't do everything because of the constant 6 pt load every day. It is a money machine and it doesn't care about it's employees.
good,Not very  helpful with expanding your nursing knowledge.  Some co-workers seemed as hated their job.  Good Location. Good Variety of Patients.  Pay was good.
good,"Leadership in my location is receptive and supportive.  On the corporate level, however, there is little support for those in the individual hospitals.  Company is too large to be an effective advocate of their employees in the field."
good,"good place to grow your career, but can be very overwhelming for nurse to patient ratios."
good,"Tenet has it model and pattern, and if you like that, with seemingly overly complicated processes - just to be overly complicated - then you'll fit right in."
good,It all depends who is sitting in the office and how many people are their favorites It is shame that these are the people that have the ability to ruin your career
good,"Even though hospital is in a rough neighborhood, it is clean and pretty safe.Co workers are great....love being a nurse."
good,"There is no typical day at work for a nurse in I.C.U......you never know one day to the next what to expect...that is part of the excitement of being a nurse in an I.C.U. setting....teaches you to think on your feet...also can be very challenging at times and very rewarding at others. My favorite part of the job is teaching my clients, their family, and coworkers. It is very rewarding when a client returns to thank you or a nurse/ student nurse appreciates the time spent with you and feels they will be a better nurse because of your teaching."
good,The individual units are a close knit group of nurses. The overall organization does not value the largest discipline in the hospital.
good,I have worked here twice. Overall nice place to work. I would say that the hospital can be described as a comfortable place to work.  Benefits are not that great.  PTO not that great.
good,As a Patient Care Tech I arrived at work I would get report from my coworker  and begin taking care of my assigned patients As a Unit Secretary I learned how to place orders in the system.  My coworkers were very helpful to me and I enjoyed helping them as well.  The hardest part of my job was giving patient baths when they couldn't help but nevertheless that made me want to help them more.  When I was the Unit Secretary I enjoyed helping the nurses because they were always so busy.  I was happy I could be there for them.  The most important and enjoyable part of my job was working with and talking with the patients and families.
good,A fast paced environment that is undergoing major changes within as a result of healthcare reform. Many of the department leaders are faced with having to get work completed with limited resources. Upper management can come off as aloof and can suffer from tunnel vision.
good,"Worked on over-night shift and enjoyed the environment."
good,"Multiple duties to complete as a case manager"
good,My experience with for-profit health care has not impressed me. Tenet cares more about money than patients or employees. Lousy management but many of the rank and file people are good persons who care about the patients despite the greedy corporate atmosphere.
good,"A typical day was very busy doing between 52 to 75 operating procedures a day, which made a lot of room for learning.  My co-workers were very helpful during my first couple of months.  They were a pleasure to work with and made the day enjoyable.  The facitly is very considerate of their employees in any department.  The wasn't any particular hard part about my position.  Every day was challanging and exciting.  The most enjoyable part was listening to patients and watching the doctors."
good,"Great training environment due to teaching institution. Management at the time were not inclined to talk to employees, more inclined to believe half truths. One managers approach was to devide and conquer, talking to everyone about everyone. This just decreased morale, productivity suffered due to turnover."
good,Good place to work except process improvements are slow to occur
good,I have been at Hahnemann for 6 years. Some days are better then most. I have to say what keeps me going back is my co-workers. They really are the best!
good,"Great place to learn and start one's ICU career.  Good exposure to vents and drips, but if you desire too become a top-notch ICU RN, not the place to stay."
good,Assessed patients. Gave out medications. Did admissions. Delegated duties to mental health techs as required.  Used deescalating techniques with violent patients.  Learned to multitask and communicate with both patients and staff members during good and difficult times. The hardest part of the job was finishing my duties while trying to beat the clock in an environment that demanded multitasking while being emotional and physically demanding at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie among staff members.
good,"Work is slow, learned nothing new, not a good fit for me.Hardest part of the job was not being allowed to scrub cases due to the fact doctors have their special techs in room. Made it hard for call because unfamiliar with surgeons preferences."
good,I have to thank Tenet Health  for allowing me to work there and gain experience.
good,"My day starts at 9 AM and ends at 5:30. What I learned in Hahnemann is that patient care is number one. Management is okay, however upper management does not recognize the service departments.My co-workers are very pleasant and older, but good workers. The most enjoyable part of my life is the patients that appreciate the services that my department delivers. The hardest part of the job is trying to move up in the hospital. It is easier for non-union members to advance as compared to union members."
good,Work is the same everyday. Must be costumer service driven. Management can be improved upon. Co-workers can me very mean at times feels like a due or die enviroment. Most people are helpfull others are out to distroy everyones day.
good,Equipment user friendly. Pay range is more than fair. Management poor. Job sites good.
good,- CLS are very helpful in training their students.
good,"I cannot say for sure why I reacted to the culture the way I did, but all I can say is, I didn't feel like I was in a friendly environment.  I took it personally."
good,"I was hire on the 10th of December, no one mentioned that they do not pay any holiday pay. There has been a number of unprofessional issues that take place on a regular bases."
good,"Loved working at the teaching hospital on the telemetry unit  extremely challenging and fast paced "
good,Miss this career. I would return to Tenethealth if I were still in Florida. A tremendous amount of challenges are what made this job exciting.  I am hoping to procure a new challenging position in my area.
good,I appreciated management's willingness to invest in one's specific training needs.  I was assigned a mentor and received hands-on training until I was ready to perform my duties on my own.
good,"Tenet Healthcare provides healthcare services to the community, its one of the leading healthcare companies serving patients, employees,physicians and partners. Healthcare is not easy and working here is a challenge a well."
good,"I did not have the opportunity to work in the main part of the hospital I was in the Institute for Mental Health. This portion of the hospital, as far as rehab goes, is slower paced and more relaxed compared to other areas."
good,It was fast-paced. It was good and flexible hours. The benefits and pay were not good. I didn't have any much supplies to complete my task. I had to buy some of my own supplies.
good,"A fairly stressful place to work, with advancement opportunities. Management has been getting better lately, but Stepdown requires you to have four patients at most times. But my co-workers are good. I cannot speak for other floors."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time there. Liked the work, liked my team. Professional growth and career advancement were limited, and org communication was subpar."
good,"Very friendly staff, Definitely a clash between new staff and old staff in my department. Management plays favorites with staff in my department. Staff throughout the hospital is friendly and easy to talk to."
good,"I enjoyed working there, but never got to work in a permanent status.  I worked there under contract for 5 years. They would tell me the company did not have the budget for a permanent position."
good,This was my introduction to working as a RN full-time in a hospital setting. I found it to be very challenging at times but it forced me to grow as a person and find ways to improve my own performance and the overall satisfaction of my patients while learning to work better with my co-workers. Very diverse group of workers that came together when work was difficult. The people that I worked with were amazing and made it work working there every day.
good,"Lots of opportunity, somewhat dependent on the division you work in and who you work for. Well organized, established, conservative policies, compliance-centered."
good,"Working for Tenet Healthcare showed me a lot about empathy towards my clients. Especially collecting on a medical bill, those types of bills are not excepted. It showed me how to deal with difficult  situations like irrate customers, death of a loved one, financial hardship."
good,I enjoyed working for Tenetcare. Clinical and non-clinical all worked together as a Team. Focus was always for the patient. Great benefits.
good,"I didn't mind the job, but night departments was always under staff so I would have to rush my work to work two other departments, that was one of the things I never liked because I only worked part time."
good,"Busy surgical-orthopedic unit especially during winter season.  Average hospital stay for patients - 3 days.  Management utilizes evidence based nursing practices - patient engagement, dvt prophylaxis.  I like my awesome, supportive co-workers.  Family-like relationships makes work easier.  Challenging at times to keep up with multi admissions."
good,"An overall great place to work in a medical career with a hospital that feels like you're not just part of a team, but rather a family. Everyone is friendly and hospitable, and do everything to work together to achieve a common goal.The organization is very good. The management does not  micro-manage, the organization does encourage a very worker friendly environment. Busy place where you can have overtime. Excellent co-workers, they are my second family away from home. I enjoy talking to my patients and I also love putting a smile on their faces."
good,I work as a per diem Labor and Delivery nurse at Hahnemann.  We have many high-risk obstetric patients.  We have a wonderful multi-disciplinary team that does a great job working together.   I have learned a lot working as a nurse there.
good,"ok place to work, management is poor, environment was poor, pay was decent"
good,A typical day at this site allowed me to work in both a clinical and research setting.
good,"Everyone is helpful and happy to say ""hello"" That is all I have to say."
good,Overall under the old umbrella it is a great place to work and advance if need b.
good,I have learned a vast amount in my nursing career while at Hahnemann for the past 10 years. I have moved my way up to lower level management. My co-workers are really what has kept me here for so long. the hardest part of my job is the ever changing field of medicine. Helping others and my schedule is the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"I enjoyed working most days. The cultural atmosphere is very prominent. If they don't like you, you will know. Certain employees go out of there way to demean you, and verbally let you know you are an outsider."
good,"Desert Regional is a very dynamic District Hospital that needed the infusion of capital for blossom. I was asked and tasked to make our Managed Care program profitable, a way for new services to meet community needs, bring Medi-Cal patients into the hospital, and meet all rules and regulations of both Medi-Cal and Medicare."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Houston Northwest Medical Center, learned a lot, advanced from a CNA to an ER Tech (non certified), and was able to experience many different things. Worked three twelve hour sifts a week (Sun., Mon., Tues.) and had the rest of the week off. I hurt my back on the job doing what my charge nurse at the time asked me to do, and after that things started going down hill fast. I was off of work with pay while attending rehab for my back, once I got back to work I was on light duty for almost two months, then the lay offs happened and I received my pink slip."
good,"High level of stress, but very good place to learn to become a very good nurse. Management is not very effective at creating a good work atmosphere. Most co- wokers a very overwhelm by the work load. The hardest part of the job is the work load nurse to patient ratio. Caring for my patients is the most enjoyable part of my job, being able to make a difference in their life."
good,"Collect all discharged patients records from all the floors, and put them in a strict. sequence order. Analyse them for the physcian's deficencies. place appropriate color stickers for each physician and other heathcares. Sometimes, unannounced pop-up questionnaire"

good,Taking care of patients. I learned to continue with patience. My coworkers are wonderfuls and a joy to work with.
good,"Decent place to work, good for a new graduate. Benefits and employee activities are decent but not great. Pay can be good for New Hires but unfortunately old employees continue to fall under the old pay structure. Department equity is unbalanced."
good,"Very good,  it was a steady job that I appreciated having"
good,"Well when came in I greet my co-workers, the nurse assistant and I would do rounds and inform me about the patient and any changes that have occurred,. answer call bells when the patient call ,assist the patient with there daily needs. I learned how to observe patient and notice any changes that may occur, I took a phlebotomy class and learned how to draw blood on the patient. Management was not that great they couldn't keep anyone in the position we went through a lot of directors."
good,"I enjoy working for tenet, its a great environment and my coworkers work as a team. we help each other out. Management are hands-on, they help around when needed."
good,I got a job at Hahnemann right after nursing school. The HR representative was amazing and helped place me on a unit that best suited my skills and personality. I learned so much at Hahnemann and am thankful for the wonderful experience I gained which helped shape me into the nurse I am today.
good,Work load in this hospital is heavy . MOst of the time we are short staffed. But work is bearable because of the coworkers and team work.
good,Great place to work. Excellent hospital in Northwest Houston.
good,"Great coworkers and love working with the patients"
good,"in the CCU, you have a 2 patient assignment, unless a patient is extremely unstable or initiating hypothermia or rewarming a patient. We care for heart failure patients, STEMIs', cardiogenic shock patients with swan ganz catheters, IABPs'. Care involves a complete assessment and updates or changes every 2 hours.  We work as a team with the CCU medical team  and other interdisciplinary health team members to provide quality and safe patient care. I work with a great group of nurses and physicians who enjoy working together as a team."
good,A great plack to work close to home and good pay make this an excellent place to purse a career
good,Small organization with great potential. Management Team is great to work with. I found the environment to be challenging at time because of the physicians.
good,Great tuition remission benefits. Most nurses don't work weekends due to the Weekend Option program.
good,Tenet needs to come up with better benefits. but overall tenet offers a collaborative and friendly environment with helpful staff and friendly knowledgeable management.
good,"Tenet is a great place to work because, everyone is a team player and their was no such thing as a favorite because, everyone was treated fairly. I would recommend this to anyone if tenet was still here."
good,"Worked there for a little under a year as security"
good,"I worked doing medical billing, collections, accts receivables, filing insurance claims, and many administrative duties. I learned a lot about HMO and PPO contracts, learned how to file claims, learned about Medicare/Medicaid filing procedures, handled collections, learned a lot of medical terminology, codes for services, and also how managed care contracts worked"
good,"I enjoyed working here, it was a great overall experience, the co workers were very friendly"
good,"While management was good, I cannot say that I valued the way patients were treated. That and only that made the job less enjoyable and not hard to leave."
good,My coworkers are great and my supervisor is also great and easy to talk to. I can bring up work related issues with her without fear and it actually feels like she cares.
good,"The main goal is to make sure we provide outstanding customer service to our patients"
good,"On average the teams that I have worked with have been great. We worked really well together. The team was close nit, almost like a family. Did our best to care for the patients. That was the common goal."
good,"Was a fun place to work, and the other employees were very passionate. Made a lot of friends that I will take and cherish going forward;we were a great group and will miss them all."
good,"I got alone with just about all Tenet director and as for my staff I can truly say they love me, For I truly believe inbeing very fair with all staff never do I play favoritism"
good,L&D staff friendly and helpful. Most difficult was heavy work load. Not enough support from management. Learned to respond to emergent situations.
good,"Saint Louis University Hospital was a great place to work for the past 5 years. I cared for the most critical patients in the area there. I was specialized in the ICU taking care of direct post-op hearts, vascular, thoracic, and transplant surgeries. I, also, have take care of medically intensive care patients.  Collaborating with physicians and medical staff, I strove to be the best at caring for these patients through education, intervention, and careful monitoring. Furthermore, I was a charge nurse in my unit facilitating the workflow of the unit and participating in case management meetings to assess patient needs. In this role, I worked closely with management to discuss and implement best practice. In addition, I precepted fellow staff to optimize team strength."
good,I learned alot over the past 8 years. The company is growing and evolving.
good,"My day starts by going to pick up patients payments. Then pull a Simplee report to see the cash payments and do the deposit . And take patients payments, Provide   billing office number. take patients payments. data entry ER charges , answering telephone , take payments payments."
good,I am very amaze with this company. Very organize. Family oriented environment.
good,"Low pay, no opportunity for advancement. Good benefits and all government holidays. Great place to get healthcare experience if you are looking to get in this sector."
good,"They use a system commonly used in car manufacturing plants called ""lean management"" to analyze productivity."
good,"I enjoyed working with the patient's. I also alphabetized all medical records, assisted with the front desk duties, along with communicating with several healthcare providers."
good,"No Job security no advancement "
good,"Controlled over 6 different facilities on a daily basis.  Kept all unidentified accounts at or near zero as possible.  Requested refunds as necessary.  Worked on many different projects as assigned.  Kept in close contact with the facility Controller and Admitting Clerk.  Posted Bank deposits, EFTS, ACH and Credit Card payments."
good,Fun work environment. Great co-workers. Learned a lot of new things. Best part was interacting with patients.
good,I enjoy starting my day by being ready to assist patient's with their health care. I have learned many things while working with the doctors at our clinic. The most enjoyable part of being at work is knowing that I make a difference in patient's lives.
good,Staff is not engaged in business. Management is autocratic in nature.  Innovations are not encouraged.  Professional growth is stifled.
good,I loved the patients an the Rn's I gained experience that I would have never gotten anywhere else.
good,Hospitals can be a challenging workplace.   When you have great co-workers and patients that truly want to receive the best care possible it makes challenge worth it.
good,"Start the day with specialty cases if they are any in the schedule, do portables in the morning, plus any studies that have been schedule, i.e. upper GI's lower GI's , swallowing studies, emergency room, operating room and mammo and bone densitometry."
good,"Although, I felt insecure 30 days after starting, I decided to give it my all. By the time I felt I established a routine and became comfortable, Tenet decided to downsize their business office and eliminated several positions. I was the last one hired, and on of the 1st ones to get layed off after only 6 months."
good,"I am interested in more flexibility and ideally a 3-4 day work week.  Tenet is unable to offer me a more flexible work schedule.  As a result, I am exploring other opportunities."
good,"Fairly easy job, but it is hard to keep from getting sucked into office politics. It was a Work Study post, max. 19 hours a week."
good,"I enjoy the work environment, but unfortunately, do not enjoy the steady decrease in my hours, due to low patient census."
good,"•	Assist Charge Nurse in coordinating and facilitating patient care services according to established standards."
good,"My position as a receptionist really allowed me to get my feet wet in a multitude of different departments. I can honestly say that this is a great company. They are expanding every day and always looking for new hires all over the country. I really enjoyed most all of my coworkers and really enjoyed getting to interact with all of the guests and most of the C-level staff. The opportunity for growth is there; permitting you don't have a power hungry, unprofessional, messy, and downright cowardly human being of a manager. If at all possible, avoid working under the Meeting Services or Admin departments. The director over these departments will belittle you, never admit mistakes and consistently expect way more of you than is humanly possible in very short amounts of time. Then the stressful time constraints will be blamed on SVP's instead of this person just admitting that they forgot to tell you to complete the task sooner (which happened VERY often). My final comment about this position is that if you do end up taking it, know that there is a severe lack of transparency, honesty and communication within the department. Wont get into detail as to how or why, but if these things are at all important in your job search, this is probably not the best place to be."
good,"Tenet Health Care is a very proactive company to work for in spite of being extremely regulated by various laws."
good,"Typical 8 hour work day coordinating patient's discharge plans after they leave the hospital. I have learned to be more organized and efficient in my work, and multi-tasking skills. This is a job were you work independently, making decisions and plans with your own best judgement and knoweldge."
good,A good learning environment and Institution.Coworkers not very sociable.Management not very friendly nor receptive to ones need.
good,"Great place to work for. everyone was nice, pay was great and also benefits."
good,Lack of team members made for a stressful work environment. Long hours were required when someone would not show up to work. Little coverage incase of a no call no show. Not the best pay for so much work that is required.
good,"Tenet is a good company to work with good benefits and great people to work with."
good,"It varies from different days, either meetings, reviewing competencies, or working on policies and protocols. I have learned about fairness throughout the organization."
good,"Hiring and staffing hospital wide volunteer service program and maintaining front desk paid receptionist for hospital."
good,Did not feel the culture of the company in the everyday but lots of hard working people trying to mold it into something. Policies were not always well defined.
good,"I worked for this company as a temp. I worked on and off for a year. I loved that it was Downtown Dallas, plenty of places to go for lunch, parking was provided and I got a break in between projects."
good,"tenent seemed to be all about the money and not the employees. they did nothing to offer further education, give raises, offer anything as far as daycare for those who needed it to help ensure that they could make it to work."
good,"Tenet corporate runs as if you are available 24 hours / 7 days a week and operates via email and webinars. Lack of Human Resource representation makes for a confusing work environment. You feel as if your job is always on the line."
good,no specifics to provide as office location is no longer open and functioning. all of Tenet Hospitals in Georgia have been or are in the process of being acquired by te Wellstar health System
good,"Fun working atmosphere. Decent amount of Politics, and alot about numbers . This is expected for a Hospital. Would have loved a long term furture if not for the employee cutbacks and hours . I did a variety of work  projects .  Worked along side very educated Leadership team . Learned alot ."
good,"Activity level varies. Medical Staff readily page for a Chaplain when a crisis occurs that needs spiritual support or when a patient is in need of extra comfort and a listening ear.  Pastoral Care is well-respected among the hospital staff and plays an important role in providing holistic care for patients, their families and staff within the hospital."
good,"there seems to be a power struggle between the department director and the department supervisor. This causes a fair amount of tension in the department. PBX is a small part of Admissions, and everyone usually gets along, however when tensions rise there is that division which benefits no one."
good,"Typical day at work:	"
good,My experience working for tenet has been good. i loved working with my coworkers and the patients were great.
good,I worked 12 hour shifts. A typical day at work would consist of 12 post-op patient's. I did one on one care until they were stable and began working with the therapy dept. There was no hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part was seeing the patient's walk out.
good,I learn a lot from my coworks. The hards parts is making everyone happy but i try. I love my job.
good,"This was my first job. The managers are friendly and the employers are also. My main job was working the register. However, I also worked expo/togo and made bread. It's an easy job, but you're always busy."
good,"I enjoy working with most of the people, I myself try to get along well  with others. We spend eight hours  a day with each other and we should get along."
good,"I was given the opportunity to join the transplant team with no prior knowledge of the service. I was grateful that my manager was willing to take a chance on me, and I was able to rise to the occasion."
good,Tenet was a huge organization who was in the process of trying to put together some standardization among the various components. This was a difficult undertaking.
good,"This was standard floor nursing job... Administered medications checking for interactions, dosages and side effects. Implemented the nursing process starting with assessments. Delegated tasks to CNA's. Responsible for starting IV therapy and monitoring it. Coordinating transfer of patients to their appointments. Collaborate with multidisciplinary care teams including physicians of the patients. Educate patients and family. The hardest part of the job was nurse to patient ratio became overwhelming. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see patients become well and be able to go home with their families."
good,"Learning the different programs offered around the local hospitals and facilities was fascinating although I needed more of an advancement and this was not the place for me.  I was there for some time and did well with the type of work, but I needed more of a challenge."
good,"The administration does not care about its employees, but management takes care of its employees. Co-workers becomes family. Administration only cares about reviews from patients, not actual medical care."
good,"our team consist of a diversity of backgrounds and we were like family with the ability to work together."
good,"Worked with this Co, with many hand changes throughout the years."
good,very nice place to work for and the staff was extremely helpful and supportive. The hospital was clean and the equipment is user friendly. Lovely building
good,I learned a lot working for this company. It was my first career job. I would recommend anyone work for them. They were helpful and informative whenever I had any questions.
good,"Shifts are typically 10 hours and management is usually very accommodating about time off if given advance notice."
good,Could do better in protecting your employees and offering ways to promote them rather than telling them that there are options and keep stringing them along but nothing ever comes out of it.
good,"Tenet allowed me to gain and expand my skills and administrative experience.  I greatly enjoyed working there.  Most corporate employees have a long tenure with Tenet and it's former companies.  Overall, a really good place to work!"
good,The day starts at 6:30 am.  You start the day off by getting your route from dispatch and loading your route onto your assigned van ensuring all items from the pick sheet has been properly loaded.
good,Fantastic experience. Gave me a solid preparation for pastoral ministry for attending to the spiritual needs of diverse faiths and cultures. My CPE supervisor has moved on.

good,"Always on your feet from the beginning to the end of the day as we deal with geriatric patients with several comorbidities. "

good,It was a good place to work.  The schedule was good and steady.  I worked the night shift.  The people were nice.  I was treated fairly.
good,The hospital itself is very old. The staff has a stuck up attitude most of the time. Predominantly spanish speaking staff members and patients.The managers are nice. HR is extremely helpful.
good,"a fun working environment that consist of hard working and supporting employees that will always accomplished the goals that is set before them, and they will always do their best to make their clients happy."
good,They give pitiful raises and are always understaffed. We never have the equipment we need and are not appreciated at all. Free parking but long walk especially in the rain!
good,This is a greast place to work. The hardest part of the job is when we get new providers to enroll. There is a lot to do to get prepared for onboarding providers. All licences and credentials must be correct with no room for error. The most enjoyable is the relationship we have with each other in the office. Everyone is willing to help since all the departments have to work hand in hand to get the job done efficiently and effectively.
good,Wonderful benefits. The working environment provides for challenging opportunities. The health care providers are very knowledgeable.
good,The hospital is continuously growing. There is always speakers and presentations at the hospital. They work on improving the environment of the hospital.
good,"I would do all of the office duties. most importantly filing,  answering phone calls, appointments, medical records. and as medical assistant I would do phlebotomy and take the BP"
good,I really enjoy working with the staff because all of them are very intelligent and friendly. They make the work enjoyable and a great learning opportunity for me.
good,"Co-workers were very friendly, easy to get along with. Providers could be very rude and disrespectful, but vast majority was very respectful, helpful, and understanding."
good,"This was one of the most rewarding jobs I have had over my working life.  The hustle and bustle, the daily unpredictability of being in a trauma level-one emergency room as a registrar could not have been more fulfilling."
good,Teamwork among coworkers and excellent relationships between nursing a physician staff made this an enjoyable place to work.
good,"A typical day is like any other ICU, some days it is slow, and other the day flies by with the work load."
good,Good company to work for but little room for advancement in current position. Learning coding to get better position. Some co-workers tend to argue.
good,Great work environment. I enjoyed interacting with my peers.
good,Diverse culture and leadership. Very comparable salary scales and employee appreciation.
good,"St Chris was a very interesting job for me to say the least. Very laid back but, busy at the same time. I enjoyed working as a standing supervisor at St Chrisopher's Hospital for children. I learned a lot about different diets. Also I learned most importantly, how to supervise an outgoing team."
good,A good stepping stone to get into the world of clinical nutrition. I have wonderful co-workers and great support from the admin team to expand our dietary department to include outpatient nutrition counseling.
good,"The staff is excellent and works collaboratively to help one another. Traffic and patient turnover is high, yet high standards of patient care are maintained. MDs on the unit are highly responsive to nursing feedback, and orders are provided expediently."
good,"Every single day was like a new expirience, because every day was a different location."
good,was very accomidating to my needs. I worked the graveyard shift.
good,"I love the team of directors/managers that I work with.  They bring me various projects to help organize their departments.  I just completed a large project of redesigning the Hospital Orientation packet for new employees.  I'm currently working on the Licensed Nursing Orientation Packet for Infection Control.  "
good,"Job was great working with the human resources vice president in preparing personnel manuals, etc.  However, living in Florida wasn't."
good,Good company for someone with drive. Management is looking for go-getters and self-starters.
good,"Per diem work. Flexible scheduling, good teamwork within PT/OT department"
good,Great Staff!  The management was good.  The overall compensation was good.
good,"A typical day at work includes, but is not limited to providing patient care, emotional support, admission assessment and plan of care management, as well as administration of medication and keeping the patient milieu running smoothly. Although I have been a nurse for over twenty years, I find that I have learned to be more efficient and be a better caregiver and patient advocate with time. I have the gift of gab and usually adapt to different people and situations quickly. I feel that I work well with other people fairly easily. The co-workers at the facility where I am currently employed generally work hard and provide a high quality of patient care. No two days are alike in the clinical setting; therefore, the most difficult part of the job is probably managing drastic changes with limited available staff. Hands down, the most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team of people.The department managers are usually visible and readily available for the department."
good,I have learned to multitask and be a team player. I enjoyed assisting the customers as well as staff and management.
good,"Fun place to work, great co-workers, challenging environment."
good,"As the Patient Safety Coordinator, I collaborate daily with Directors and Managers at both campuses to gather departmental data. I ensure staff knowledge of National Patient Safety Goals through in-service. I perform mock Joint Commission rounds along with other organization managers to ensure staff competency and proper procedure performance. Once a month, organizational data is provided to the Patient Safety Committee for review."

good,"overall good place to work, Good atmosphere. Good co-workers"
good,accounting job  learned various aspects of hospital and different departments and how each interact with each other during the care of patients.

good,Tenet's mission is to improve the quality of life of every patient who enters our doors. Our approach makes us unique and defines our future
good,the coworkers help one another with each other dutlies. The hospital is a learning hsopital managment provides anything you want to know. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing im helping someone in need. There is really not a hard part of the job.
good,hard work everyday and wonderful patients that I loved to help
good,"Great people, I enjoyed working there everyday. opportunities for advancement and education."
good,"Since starting in April, 2012 there is a new CNO, CEO and nurse manager on my unit. I have seen positive changes in the short time I have been there and know there are more to come. I care for mostly post cardiac catheterization patients as well as patients being observed due to chest pain being I work on a telemetry unit. We are a busy unit with an average patient stay of 2-3 days."
good,A culture that holds fast to the way they have consistently done business for years. Seek to insure integrity in their approach to the hospital business.
good,"St. Mary's ICU was a joy to work in. However, I was disappointed with the old 8-hour shift schedules."
good,Multitask and problem all that's on my to do list as well as put out fires that arises during the busy work schedule. The morning starts out with outlining the responsibilities and deadline that's due/coming up.
good,I enjoyed working with the patients in making them feel better emotionally.
good,"pharmacy department personnel very close, as if they all belonged to a mutual family. at time undestaffed. this creates a setting of pressure for pharmacist to stay overtime yet overtime not allowed. Nevertheless, it appers that once a pharmacist quits DRMC, they eventually go back. its funny and very interesting. overall, it is a fun place to work."
good,"management skills, discharge planning, ICD9 codes"
good,Being in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a premier Intensive Care Unit is stressful to say the least. I was amongst some of the best healthcare professionals who guided me mentored me. They are the reason I am studying in healthcare today.
good,It was a good place to work. I learned great iv skills. Learned about oncology. Multiple admissions made the job a little stressfull.
good,"Benefits were better in the beginning, learned much about myself professionally and personally, enjoy most of my co-workers, management has been bereft of leadership for years, new Director has grand vision for our growth, looking for opportunities elsewhere due to wife living in a different State."
good,The company has been downsizing for the past couple of years.  I am unsure about their future and whether or not they will continue downsizing. I do feel that they have an opportunity to position themselves since their stock prices have been improving.
good,Tenet used to be an amazing place to work.  I was there for almost 30 years.  I grew as a person and professionally.  With the new management I am not sure where their heart lies.  Not sure if they are only about making money or if people actually even matter anymore.
good,Good company to work for. They need to include Remote employees more in hospital activities.  Not enough time was given to employees when they outsourced our jobs.
good,"Tenet was a reasonable good company to work for. My day was always filled and it was not unusual to work quite a bit of overtime. Training was good and often. Most of my superiors were good to work with, but there are always those outliers that were not as good to work for, it just comes with the job I guess. I enjoyed the people I worked with and both my superiors and the employees that worked for me were highly professional. The hardest part of my job was typically around month end close which was very long hours and could be wrought with last minute changes.  Tenet's month end process was highly complex and that is compared to other organizations I have worked for. The part I enjoyed the most during my tenure at Tenet was the people I worked with and the customers we served."
good,This company has closed several locations. This company was the best company to work for. It was relaxed and the coworkers were awesome. I would recommend this company if it were still open
good,"Fast paced, with changes to the processes on a regular basis. Always learning about new products and advances in procedures. Management has been in flux for a few months, so there is a lack of consistency, but it is coming together with staff stepping in to fill the void. Hardest part of the job is the ""teasing"". Certain people need to be gossips and it becomes annoying. I enjoy the knowledge I receive and it's different every day. Achievements are there just not always recognized."
good,"Fast paced and rewarding and sometimes stressful environment. Usually good people to work with. Pay was fair i guess. way too much turnover and layoffs,"
good,Robust learning environment. Leaders are familiar with all aspects of management due to lack of adequate staffing and resources. Overall pleased with organization.
good,Teaching facility.  Most everyone is helpful and understanding.  Great experience in a trauma center.  Fast paced and disorganized at times.  Good work-life balance - minus the traffic.
good,I really enjoyed this clincal role with the surgery center. The role flexed with different assignments monthly which provided ongoing clinical education.
good,"Very culturally diverse workforce, very busy ER, normally working with high acuity patients in the ER. Management is nice. I learned to deal with trauma and high acuity patients."
good,I spent some time in the nutrition and nursing departments. The staff was friendly and allowed me to assist them in various ways. It was a great place to volunteer.
good,"In this clinical setting you will schedule patient appointments, perform patient registration process, verify insurance"
good,Tenet Healthcare is an excellent place to work.  I enjoyed my time working at Saint Louis University Hospital.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"I work with a great group of people, I'm still new to the company but we will seexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
good,"Typical day- work all day but does not recommend staying pass 40 hour week"
good,"Nice place to work, especially my former supervisor. She was very understanding especially when it comes to family. The Nursing Supervisor at night was a very understanding and helpful person."
good,"•	Assessed and facilitated care of critically ill patients utilizing hemodynamic monitoring and mechanical ventilation support"
good,My only reason for seeking employment elsewhere is due to the inabilty for me to advance in my field within and my need for a schedule that is more conducive to the needs of my single parent family and demands.
good,"A typical day would be answering emails, vendor calls, keying invoices, opening mail, filing."
good,"It was always interested to go to work."
good,"Directly responsible for training and evaluation of all new Assistant Directors / managers on the operation systems and policies of Hospital Housekeeping Systems, and as an EVS Director."
good,"A typical day for me was responding to employee and patient grievances. Reviewing payroll, and productivity reports daily, approving supply orders, interacting with patients and staff on unit. Reviewing payor sources and reviewing uninsured/insured. Covering staff vacations and call outs.  The hardest part of the job was encouraging staff to remain positive during the changing environment and culture of the facility."
good,Some great co-workers; excellent teaching institute; worked short staffed at times.
good,"A typical work day would be come in and get myself situated and then answer phone calls throughout the day, faxes, daily pulls for reviewers. I have learned so much about the hospital from patient information, HIPPA, most of the hospital terminology. For the most part the managment is good they are very helpful when needed. The people I work with are alright I mean were all women in here so at some points there could be alot of opinions thrown around, alot of picking and choosing. "
good,"learning work place, I am able to  perform many skills"
good,"Conducted audits for contracted Managed Care payers, collect billing errors and conduct follow up."
good,"Worked there for a little over 2 years, and enjoyed it very much. Collective bargaining a must with them."
good,Atlanta Medical is in the top five ranking of Atlanta's hospitals.
good,"A typical day at work included patient care and supervision. I learned about hospital procedures, logistics, and culture. I was also able to see what I had learned in the classroom in real life. My co-workers were great, fun, and easy to work with. My bigeest challenge was cleaning patients that had caused a big mess, because of how uncomfortable it was. I mostly enjoyed seeing the look on the face of patients feeling better as a result of my involvement in their care."
good,"A typical day at work included adminstration of medications, admission assessments, intiating and implementing care plans as well as communication with physicians to provide quality patient care."
good,I enjoyed my job.  Until Management changed and the culture changed.  Which then made it very difficult for me to accomplish everything that I started to build.  With new management comes new Ideas and different beliefs.  I just wanted to take care of my patients and my staff.
good,"Work on the Daily is a challenge but can also be enjoyable with the right staff. culture on some floors is great and on others needs work ,organization is a need right now with proper nurse to patient ratio."
good,"Tenet overall is a great company to work for. As you know the medical field is always changing, so you have to be very fluid with change. "
good,the company made the decision to move the entire operation to the state of Texas where the corporate office is located. the positions were down sized and staff laid off.
good,Great for nutrition majors to see if they wanted to pursue a career path in dietetics. Learned a lot more about the field of nutrition than I would have in a classroom.
good,loved my job there. but always worked short staffed and management wouldn't listen to the staff's concerns. Patient safety was an issue.  It is a place to acquire much needed experience.
good,"For the most part, I loved working at St. Mary's Medical Center. Towards the end of my experience working there, I sometimes felt overwhelmed and over loaded with patients, due to short staffed conditions."
good,an educational experience. pushes to greatness. teamwork eases the stress related with patient acuity. a feeling of accomplishment when there is good patient outcomes
good,"A lot of referrals daily with few resources to offer. Generally pleasant people to work and collaborate with.  Benefits you if you come in fully trained with general responsibilities, as little training offered."
good,"Running the linen department and EVS on a daily basis, making sure  our patients had quality linen. The first impression of the hospital medical building and the outer clinics, was the cleanliness"
good,"Tenet Healthcare is a wonderful establishment to work at as long as you are not looking for advancement.  However, they provide wonderful a benefits package and work environments."
good,"I liked the people I worked with and the atmosphere was good, no real issues as this was a good job with good people to work with.  I enjoyed it a lot and would go back."
good,I started working on a part-time basis and was hired as full-time. This was my first job in Corporate America. It helped tremendously in gaining experience in Patient Accounting and understanding Revenue Cycle Management in Healthcare
good,Tenet was a great company to work for. They had great benefits and kept the morale up at all times. One thing that I love about Tenet is that they give bonuses for your hard work.
good,Many short term and ad-hoc reports are created for management.  Most of the co-workers are friendly and more than willing to help one another.  Short deadlines are sometimes difficult to meet.
good,Great teamwork and charge nurses take the time to teach when new experiences arise. There is always something new to learn. Continuing education is always encouraged. Atmosphere is supportive and family-like as we always celebrate everyone's birthdays as a group at work. Our nurse manager is an excellent leader and makes time to listen to our concerns while constantly helping us to be the best nurses we can.
good,"Its a great place to work. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at this facility. It is a great place to work. It was family orientated, the support my decision for advancement."
good,"I enjoyed working there it got quite busy most times. I learned more medical terminology. My co-workers were usually fun to work with ."
good,"A typical day in the hospital setting dealing with patients with mental illnesses is a challenge that requires patience, empathy, and understanding.  Each day I meet with patients and discuss their care plans and help them cope with daily challenges.  I work closely with doctors and a team of nurses to help each individual in the mental health ward.  I learn new things about each patient every day and do my best to help them with what they ask of me.  I have a good rapport with my co-workers and support from management.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the unknown.  Some patients could have explosive behaviors, some could be mute, while others could be completely manic.  It is an acquired skill to be able to adapt to each patient and meet their needs accordingly.  The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing the patients react positively to our help.  It is always rewarding to see patients come to terms with their illnesses and work toward learning to stabilize their conditions."
good,"Great job. Great people. I enjoy the balance of work and family. Hours can be long, but you can work fewer days. You even get benefits with relief positions."
good,"As a contractor, working for Tenet Health has made me feel very content. Tenet Health has provided me with job security and safety enviroment. Tenet Health cares about their employees, their safety and acknoledges the employees hard work."
good,This hospital has potential to be better than it already is. It's in the midst of a move to a new facility under a new name where it is hoped that they will be able redefine and excel their great reputation.
good,"A typical day would involve a lot of walking through the hospital to meet and interview patients. I got the chance to meet a lot of interesting people and heard a lot of interesting stories as well. My co-workers were great and we all got along and worked well together. the hardest part of my job was seeing people hurt really bad, and the best part was seeing them well before discharge."
good,"Love all my co-worker and everyone is a team player. My typical day is busy but can get crazy with the workflow we get. The best part is that every employee helps out and we all get the job done! All my co-workers are friendly and we all get alone. Most enjoyable part of work, work hard but make the best of our time joking and helping each other out. Only negative part about this company is that the pay sucks. So time for better and bigger things!!!!"
good,A typical patient assignment consists of 3-4 patients in the surgical/trauma step-down unit. The shifts are 12 hours long 3 days a week. I have learned many things over the years that I have been there. There is a vast population of patients in an inner city hospital. My co-workers work constantly as a team. The hardest part of the job is seeing patients do very well post-op and then start to go downhill after. The best part of my job is helping people from all different types of cultures and backgrounds.
good,"As a staff nurse at Hahnemann University Hospital I have the privilege to say that due to our patient population, the experience you can gain here as a nurse is exceptional. I provide complete care to a maximum of 4 patients which gives me the advantage to become better at drawing blood and putting intravenous lines, and most importantly to think critically. As a nurse in a unit that mostly practices interventional cardiology and medical/surgical I have the opportunity to see a variety of patients with different conditions, which gives me the advantage of becoming familiar with many disease processes and how to treat them. Even though the job can at times be stressful and tiring since I have to provide complete care to patients, team work is big part of my job and this makes it very enjoyable. On the other hand the job is very challenging because I see many patients that are drug seeking and it is very hard to maintain them happy and provide the best care since physicians at times are reluctant to give them what they want for their own good. I am undoubtedly happy to be part of this great team but I am looking forward into moving to New York and I am actively looking for nursing opportunities where I can bring the knowledge I have acquired within the past 10 months"
good,I worked part time as a  med surg nurse  and enjoyed the experience
good,This is place where we can get chance to work on R&D projects and gain more knowledge about available technology and cost-effective solutions
good,Take care of patients in critical care setting. Nice place to work. Seeking advancement.
good,I found it to be an great company to work for the 10 years I was there employed with them. I truly in joyed Holidays times there.
good,"More nurses are needed for the patient population. Many lives are saved, friendships are made, lifetimes are changed."
good,"Lots of different exams to do from radiography, fluoro, to c-arm surgical cases."
good,"A typical day at work for me is making sure i hit every station i guess you can call me a floater. Im on instruments till we are caught up, then ill help wrap run loads, and help out in decon. I enjoy working with my team it makes the job easier to work with people on the same page. The hardest part of my job i believe is making sure that everything is properly done by the end of my shift. I enjoy my job because i enjoy working with my hands and it makes the day go by faster."
good,"1. Start with 7 patients."
good,Great place to work. Company has great benefits and promotes within.
good,"Hahnemann University Hospital follows an All-RN Model type of nursing. Registered nurses are expected to perform the duties of patient care technicians, phlebotomists, IV insertion team, as well as nursing duties. Nurses are assigned to four patients to care for throughout their shift. Vitals signs and assessments are completed every four hours to cardiac telemetry patients.  Medications and blood samples are completed as ordered by the nursing staff. Patients are closely monitored for any changes in their status and physicians are appropriately notified in order to provide specific interventions. The majority of patients have cardiac issues such as CHF exacerbation, NSTEMI, pre- and post- cardiac catheterizations, however, we do receive COPD exacerbations, Liver failure, and ESRD patients. "
good,"Organized emergency room. "
good,I have enjoyed working at the hospital where I have helped and assisted a diverse group of individuals who show up for help. I learned a lot about the functions and the administrative side of the hospital.
good,I work in the ER so every day is different. The people I work with  make the job easy. It is very rewarding to know that what you do makes a difference in someone's life.
good,I liked going to work everyday at St Christopher Hospital and working with kids who were like a ball of energy.
good,"Houston Northwest is a employer that had a great number of dedicated employees, even while our employer is going through changes in patient demographics and some financial shortfalls due to length of stay and a greater number of uninsured using our hospital."
good,Personal was helpful . Hospital with good values. Good team of people to work with.
good,"I worked for this company for most of my adult life, I worked in many different depts. within the hospital and most of my experience was great, management can get difficult at times but that is to be expected in a hospital setting."
good,Typical day at work is having 14 pts to assisit with care...What I learned is how to become a team player..Management to me can be some what better..I enjoy working with most of my co workers..The hardest part of the job is patient load and long hours.Seeing a smile on my patients face tells me I have met there needs
good,"Tenet as a whole is an great employer to have. Offer a varity of work shifts and the benefits, both health and 401K are nice. "
good,The residents were very nice and the management was excellent.
good,"Greeting patients, physicians, answering heavy phones."
good,This is a VERY busy facility with a great opportunity to advance in different fields and departments.
good,"I loved working as a NICU nurse. The only reason I resign is due to the death of my sister in law and having to move to Delaware to help my brother raise his 4 children. I loved caring for the neonates and learning something new everyday. Upper management was great, the NICU director, I feel the manager and educator fell short when it came to orientation and would convientently take me off orientation during the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the children grow and get better and helping the very sick ones in their times of need."
good,Going the extra mile and working more than expected or required means nothing above the local office. Even working on the computer while on vacation or regular days off meant nothing.
good,"working for a healthcare organization is purpose filled as the work you do is helping others to save lives. As with any other role in a company, some days are better than others but the goal is the same."
good,"I worked with patients that was addicted  to substances and many had behavioral issues. We started the shift with reports , made rounds to assesses the patients to make sure they were safe. "
good,"Great place to work, opportunities for career advancement and advance education with tuition reimbursement for staff covered under the collective bargaining agreement."
good,"Engaging workplace that encouraged you to bring out the best in your talents while providing the Gold standard in Healthcare. You were able to plan your day and network with several hospitals and city municipalities. "
good,"* busy, non-invasive position, serving patients."
good,Good pkce to work. Close to home which was great. Manager was wonderful ans easy to work along side. Smaller facility so closeness of staff. Benefits were lacking and no promotional potential.
good,"I chose SVRMC, because it was close to home, a trauma center and proactive in the community. The best part of the job is working with physicians who work well with nurses as a collaborative care team."
good,"The only downside is the location. It's not easily accessible by public transportation, nor is it easy to drive to. Generally 1-2 hour commute each way, depending on traffic."
good,"The problem was that one day several, government officials walked into Lucy Lee Hospital, and investigated the management for fraud. Some of my charts were taken, there were no problems, and I started to look for work elsewhere. I found out ""calling back"" that the professional became angry, and they built there own hospital, and they manage it themselves. "
good,Everyone knew each other and it was a community Hospital feel but being in the inner city with many frequent familiars. The hospital treated many HIV clients because of it being in the inner city.
good,Organizing  assignments with staff shortage was one of the challenges faced on a daily basis. Successful  coordination of nursing care on the Telemetry unit is a big challenge.
good,"My time there was when THC was National Medical Enterprises.  Around the time I left, the CEO and founder's contract was not renewed, the company sold its psychiatric division, the company merged with American Medical Enterprises and moved its headquarters to Texas.  I cannot comment on the company in its current iteration."
good,"A very hands-on, teaching atmosphere. Much encouragement to gain knowledge and advance your skills. Management needs restructuring."
good,"wondefrul work enviroment, culturally rich in family involvement, manager  provided time to empathize and offer solutions to employess issues, great place to work."
good,"I did mostly secretarial work, but was occasionally allowed by the nurses to do feeding, cuddling, bathing and even hearing exams."
good,Even during and after the transition to the new company there was a sense of team work and family shared with fellow coworkers regardless of what role a person played in providing services.
good,"In addition to handling phones and walk-ins to the education department, I created a new system for tracking the required educational credits of all employees of the hospital and notified their supervisors when a requirement was coming due. I liked learning new skills related to the hospital setting and setting up and maintaining the department's web page on the hospital's intranet."
good,"I enjoy taking people I am a giver, so I believe in giving my all to providing the best care that I know  how. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping someone to go home better than they came."
good,Working at St. Christopher's as a nurse extern was a great learning experience. The nurses were so willing to educate me. It made me realize my love for pediatric nursing.
good,"I have really enjoyed my time with TENET. Unfortunately, they have undergone a merger with Baylor Scott & White, and it has gone down hill sense. The environment seems to always be on edge."
good,"After working in adult cardiac cath lad for over ten years the expectation was for me to learn pediatric cardiac cath quickly.  Pediatric cardiac cath is completely different and at least six months training would have helped me to understand the concepts better."
good,"Great location, poor culture. Favoritism is shown in every department. Little room for advancement. Too relaxed on policies and procedures."
good,"I am a RN with over 19 years experience. I am transitioning out of direct patient care. I am interested in health care management, recruiting and clinical reasearch. I am open to all oportunities."
good,tenant health is great for nursing student just starting out. This place will easily welcome anyone in the medical field who just needs that first time experience.
good,"Pro: Very good wages, some of the best I've seen compared to other hospitals."
good,"Answering patients concerns in reference to insurance, copays and hospital setting. Training new hires and providing refreshers to co-workers with programs to verify insurance and understand patient benefits. Supporting other departments within patient registration when staff is low. Completing quality reports for hospital. Fulfilling duties that are assigned from upper management such as, patient compliants and transferring patient charges to correct accounts. Being able to be the best support system to my coworkers is the best. The hardest part of my job is when patients are emotional because they can't afford elective procedures."
good,The pay is not that great. I took a pay cut coming to work for this company. My immediate supervisor is pretty good though.
good,Originally started in regular home health department. Became involved with the team that headed up a newly formed high tech department. Improved education in the care of home bound patients. Became certified in PICC insertion. Good management and co workers. Working weekends on a fairly regular bases. Most enjoyable part taking care of my patients and being able to learn more skills
good,"My internship through St. Christopher's Hospital happen to be in the Pulmonary Department educating the patients and their families about their asthma, and the procedures on controlling it."
good,Love the staff and patients!! You can gain great expoerience at this job.
good,I really enjoy my position as an RN in the NICU.  The most difficult part of the job is the inconsistency in available hours.
good,Working for Tenet Healthcare was very rewarding. While working there I have grown in my professional and personal life.
good,"I worked 12 shifts/36 hours per week and lots of overtime. I enjoyed my work a lot mainly because of the ability to communicate with my patients and their families and teach them everything they needed to know and more.  PACU is taking care of patients before they go to surgery and/or after they return from surgery.  After surgery they are either discharged from us to a patients room or home(if surgery was minor) and the patient was stable.  I learned much over the 40+years I was a trauma nurse(ER, CCU/ICU, Thoracic ICU, PACU).  In medicine things are changing daily and you have to stay ahead of the game, so to speak. To be a trauma nurse you need to have a great knowledge base and you have to have the ability to work fast,"
good,"The principal, counselors and students assisted me in embracing the culture of education."
good,"sfmc was a well rounded in specialty facility, im so thankful for my experience there because it taught me so much. Its a great place for a new scrub or nurse to learn different surgical specialties."
good,"Daily interaction with the director of the department, organized strict deadlines and areas in urgent need of completion. "
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the people I got to work with. Great teamwork
good,"Job Duties:"
good,Teaching wonderful expecting parents how to better their birth experience.  Working with the new moms on the postpartum floor helping with breastfeeding.
good,"Great admin team, and wonderful employees. Hospital does a lot to recognize employee's and they pride themselves in patient satisfaction."
good,"Take care all Pt. on the B/H unite help out Dr. and nurse on "
good,I work nights so it easy going not a lot going on. We have a good manager . my co worker are great . The hardest part of my job is staying awake at night and getting nurses to keep their patients on the monitor. I love this job because the heart is so amazing . knowing the little things that can change rhythm or a heart rate.
good,"Admitting patient making them feel welcome, collecting co-pay, answering phones, scheduling appointment, and filing paperwork."
good,"I think the hardest part of the job was the 12-hour shift. Over a period of time it made me feel like giving up.  I've done my best but its time to move on."
good,"As a health care organization, They of course have very strict rules which absolutely have to be enforced due to the sensitive matters involved."
good,"Team work, cultural diversity, culture of I care implemented."
good,A variety of personnel that contributed to a common cause and had been part of Tenet for many years.
good,"Through the years at Atlanta Medical Center I grew as a person, became more experienced in what i did but most of all it gave me the greates opportunity to give back to the patients; especially to those that did not speak the language. I also encounter great co-workers, supervisors and made true friends. the harderst part of my job was during my time in the ER, seeing traumas and patients in pain just made me realized how lucky and blessed i was every night i made it home to my family."
good,The reason I am looking is I am on night shift and after 11pm have to cover icu 3 floors and pic u and 2 er
good,"I found it to be very good organization to work for, as a part-time employee, I received good benefits."
good,"A typical day at work I come in and check emails and work on provider enrollments. That consist of quality checking licenses, background information, medical school/internship/fellowship/residency information. Also enrolling providers with various insurance companies to ensure their claims are paid and processed. "
good,Work load and staffing were completely unrealistic. Benefits were fine and salary was fine.  Honestly felt ignored or placated by administration when issues were addressed.
good,There have been many changes within our office that have made people feel singled out. We all put in our effort to make the best we can of each situation and learn everything needed in order to continue with our career path.
good,The only thing at the time is that Tenet was bought out to WellStar and that was do unfortunate because they are not nearly as goodd to patients or employees as Tenet Healthcare
good,Tenet offers a great benefit package. The business day is a typical 8 hour work day. There are days that are more challenging than others. At times it can be stressful because of the nature of the job. There are deadlines to meet at month end. Overall it is a good place to work.
good,Pay was good.  I enjoyed going to work.  Work environment was pleasant.  Work life balance was ok. There were many opportunities to advance your knowledge.
good,"I've worked for Tenet in a variety of capacities and the growth I've experienced has been truly beneficial.  Many of the employees I've worked with have truly become great friends and have helped shape me into the worker I am, by believing in me and giving me challenging tasks to grow my career and for that I'm thankful."
good,Leadership has a great team culture.  All strive to focus on patient and work together to ensure the patient has a good experience as well as the patient's family/friends.
good,"Ran work orders, Checked, Repaired and PM A/C and Heating patients Units. PM, Checked and repaired 36 Ice Machines through out Hospital. What an enjoyable job that I had worked!"
good,Excellent company to work for.  Issues occurred around financial stability of the company as a whole when a activist board members raised a flag about operations.
good,"The radiology department is a great department to work in, the co-workers are like a family and are always having celebration lunches. The only drawback is they work with a skeleton crew."
good,"It is a family, everyone helps everyone. Learning is an everyday experience and there are always changes to the  job. The hours are great and the work is not easy but not too hard. Be attentive to the customers and always pat attention to detail."
good,Meaningful work- employees are dedicated to provide quality care to all patients. The most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team with people who care about improving the quality of health information.
good,Dynamic CEO allows his people to do their job.  I have had great support from senior staff.  I am always given the opportunity to offer my suggestions while thinking out of the box
good,The staff within this hospital are like family. It is a very caring environment. There is always opportunity for growth in your field of choice. Frye Regional Medical Center is a very big supporter of one's continuing education.
good,"I had the opportunity for the first time to meet many seasoned Medical professions who were no longer at SLUH when i was eventually hired on as an employee. The workplace experience was wonderful, the management team sets the tone for success."
good,"At the time I worked at Tenet, it was the second largest healthcare company in the world and operated in a highly corporate manner. This was an adjustment especially for nursing professionals as well as medical staff members. But, the company strongly enforced ethical business practices and, although very budget-minded, investments were made in improving patient care."
good,"front office pain center. staff was wonderful. New management after growth was not god for staff and patients"
good,"	Collected, analyzed, and monitored key data metrics derived from client’s daily business operations."
good,"Great place to work. Great benefits, good pay. Each department is urged to have great patient care, meet the needs of family and meet national standards."
good,"Was a fair place to work that required a lot of critical thinking. Team work was appropriate if you were liked by your coworkers. As soon as you lost their trust, you were destined to drown."
good,"busy and long days, awesome management. Lots of learning opportunities. The doctors are very knowledgeable and have long standing patient base. Place excepts walk-ins and has Saturday hours."
good,"Excellent place to work. Great Drs.,& Coworkers.I was homesick at times and they made me feel like family. I had my first child while I was there and they allowed me to bring her to work for 6 months. I was so loved there and appreciated.I worked for 3 pediatricians and 1 Internal Medicine doctor. I did everything in the office and was valued for my hard work.."
good,"Level II trauma center in Palm Springs, California.  Great pay compared to surrounding area.  A lot of politics in upper-level management with presence of unions in front-line staff."
good,"Cannot with hold response and move on in this program.  However, I never worked for Tenet.  Tenet bought Huntington Intercommunity Hospital after I left."
good,"Learned Cerner PowerChart Maternity, FirstNet, PowerPlans and FetaLink while working on site at many Tenet hospitals.  A good place to work and great people to work with."
good,"Ongoing training was essential. However, salaries were not so great when I was there, we were overworked for the little money they were paying us, but overall it was a great company."
good,"I work with the most talented people I have ever had the pleasure of working with. People are very nice and welcoming. Those two reasons are significant in my reasons for staying with the company. Unfortunately, there is little investment in employees that have non-clinical roles. Currently, there is no tuition reimbursement benefit or technical education beyond MS Office. There is no training for lower or midlevel managers to be better leaders. I believe there are some great people that if given the assistance to receive an MBA would be amazing assets to the company. With all that said, change is in the air to address this problem. There is a lot of uncertainty with the healthcare industry, but I am very optimistic that Tenet will adapt and continue to be a leader."
good,Overal its a nice place to work and good environment with very good benefits. Everyone is very friendly and nice to work up close with everyone.
good,"Working as an open heart nurse was a great experience, however the hospital has since closed. It was a level II trauma center and gave great exposure to me as a fairly new nurse in a critical care setting. I wish they were still open for business, it was a busy heart center."
good,"Its a good place to learn about the hospital life. Good work place, nice hours, management is good , helps whenever you need time off"
good,This was my first L&D job as a RN. I loved the team I worked with. They taught me so much. The volume was low and the unit closed.
good,"The management was great.  I found manager to be easy going, great personality, supportive in nature and created a job culture that was light hearted and fun. He was one of the best managers I ever worked for.  When there was a need for correction, he was respectful, supportive, provided the training or resources for growth and never condescending or disrespectful to his employees."
good,Busy environment.  My experience was that of an agency nurse who only work when there was shortage of staff.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers
good,Great benifits through tenet. Large hospital with many residents and nurses. Good teaching facility with association to major university.
good,"This job was great ,but  was short ,because it  was a travelers assignment but very pleasant place to work. The ICUs were in a circular arrangement and you could keep a eye on all pt. at the same time."
good,West Boca Medical Center provided me with sufficient training. They are very involved with employees and their continuing education. It was a pleasant work environment.
good,"Over the past 15 years, I gained loads of experience not only clinically but also with people of all backgrounds.  A typical day for me would be to maintain the flow of clinic providing quality customer service to our patients, efficiency to the providers while meeting our departments mission and goals on a day to day basis.  I enjoy working with my co-workers we're like a family which makes it easy to arrive to work everyday.  Everyone is great from management to clinical/administrative staff.  The hardest part of my job would be watching patients whom I've grown to love go through illness and sickness.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being part of the process to help make them better.  Many aspects of healthcare in regards to what I've learned academically and in the midst of the daily functions I've performed over the years made me capable and passionate to one day be in the position to run an impressive and efficient operation."
good,I had internship in the hospital. It was interesting job. I love to help people. I had practice 6 month in the vascular department and 6 month in the general department.I learn a lot and very thankful for the practice.
good,"The hospital I worked at was a not for profit hospital when I started. Patient care was all that mattered. When Tenet purchased our hospital it took all of us quite a long time to adjust to the workings of a for profit hospital. However, the benefits far outweighed the negatives. New equipment, better benefit packages, and competitive wages were all positive changes. Dealing with a large company made decision making at all levels much more tedious because of the added levels of management. Overall, I enjoyed my time there."
good,"nice place to work,very productive,a place for advances,and the people was very friendly and helpful.some  of the supervisor was very helpful and nice."
good,"By the time I left, after 25 years, we had gone to computerized documentation and our case load was 4 patient max. across both shifts. We each worked 3-12 hour shifts each week and every 3rd weekend. The patient population on our unit was Orthopaedic/Neurosciences/level 2 trauma. We had a few ""frequent flyers"" courtesy of the neurology service. My co-workers mostly kept to themselves, but I have maintained a few good friendships through the years. Management appeared cut-throat by the time I left, more difficult to work with than for. I learned to hone my skills and perfect what I'd learned. Most difficult part for me was the addition of telemetry to our case load."
good,"At FRMC I performed various tasks.  Among them were order  verifier, pre-register patients, register patients, verify insurance benefits, comply orders with Medicare, coded orders and procedures, fill in the front desk when needed, collect patient payments."
good,"Great company to work for, very organized. management always involved and helped out when needed."
good,"This place has a wonderful team."
good,very smooth.how  to scrub plastic cases.my co -workers were nice.nothing was to heard.having a good day.
good,"The Hospital atmosphere is very varied, sometimes a routine work day becomes quite challenging. But much experience is gained & one can easily be opened to new opportunities"
good,I enjoy working there. we are contanstantly short shaffed.
good,Working in the ER is something that I love and being able to work with other staff that are supportive is very nice.
good,Great team of dedicated professionals. Opportunities for professional growth.
good,"I say that Tenet is an educational place to work because I am constantly learning if not in my department in other areas of the hospital. I have learned how physicians on different services navigate through their work stations, this gives me the knowledge to help physician new or ones who may not have caught on, how to navigate in their work stations. The same applies to nurses and other staff in the hospital. The most enjoyable part of my job is successfully helping someone,  a physician, co worker or patient/patient family. The hardest (sadest) part of my job is helping family members who have had a tragic loss and are struggling with arrangements. It makes me feel good to know that when they leave I helped lift some burden off their shoulders to help deal with their loss."
good,"We work hard, but it is very rewarding. Tenet offers a great programs for education. The management support employees dicisions regarding work place. Great people works at Tenet, everyone helps and supports each other."
good,I enjoyed my coworkers most at this company.  This was a teaching hospital. The education was great.
good,"I was responsible for going to nursing home and collecting specimens, collecting in house specimens and processing in main lab. I learned a lot of testing requirements while working in main lab. My workers were very helpful in teaching me. I enjoyed my time here."
good,Great company to work for with excellent benefits. Administration and HR are not you most professional environment....
good,I love what i do here - the only drawback is that deals take too long to complete due to due diligence. Not all prospective practices are run the same way and so challenges arise in valuing practices.
good,"Providing bedside care for critically ill patients, in a medical/cardiac care unit. Providing information and support of patients' family members.

Management, while facing it's own challenges, continues to support us as employees, thay see us as workers, but also as someone's parent, child, spouse, etc., and they make it a pleasure to work in a flexible environment while continuing to put the care of our patient first.  You get what you give, and I learn something new every day.  My co-workers and I pick each other up if someone is not having the best day ever, and we share the workload.  You don't have to love the people you work with, but they are my extended family, and you just have to respect them, and work together to get to the end of the day.  The hardest part of my job is when the outcome for a patient is not the best, you never get used to it, but that makes the most enjoyable part of the job when there is the good outcome and the family is happy with the treatment and care they received.  We are there to make a profit for the hospital, but the way I see, the patient should always profit as well, they deserve it, and at the end of the day, treat people the way you want to be treated, and you sleep good at night."

good,"Most days were very busy, there is only one operator per shift.  I learned how the communication core of a hospital works.  This is considering in coming calls, out going calls.  411 and 911 for the entire hospital!  My co workers made you feel at ease and were very helpful.  The most rewarding part of his position, was watching how with time, the employees respected me and found themselves comfortable coming to me to help them out.  Also having them tell me, I was a fair and understanding supervisor!"
good,"A typical day at my job is crazy. You can never be more prepared for your day because something else always comes up that make you say "" WOW! That really did happen."" Although it has its bad days I have learned alot their. I`ve learned to be more or a team player more just being alone and during it myself,and to trust more. But most of all my co-workers were the best. we would laugh all night long about how long the night is going to be.The hardest part about my job is seeing people die. Thats something that I will never get over. I start to think about that persons life and what they could have had if this did not happen to them, and their families are so heart broken when you tell them the news about their love ones passing. Every job has its up`s and down`s but the most enjoyable part about my job is when someone tells me I`ve changed their lives, or just thanks for stopping to talk to them and learn to their stories. That puts a smile on my face because there is nothing more heart warming than someone telling you you changed their life."

It was my responsibility to see that the quarterly board meetings were scheduled, posted and approved in advance (2 years).  Established direct line of communication with each board member, providing updates as they related to the individual committees they served on to the actual Board meetings. Ensured that all Board materials were received, reviewed and posted timely for the members to reviewed.  Oversaw all event planning for board meetings to include travel (both domestic and on corporate jet) - hotel, ground transportation, dinners and off-site events.

good,"A typical work day in the Managed Care Department, depending on the load as to what contracts have to be followed up, who needs to be contacted, what the team requires.  There was a lot of ""drop what you're doing, we need you to... .""  Telephones have to be answered and whatever issues come up that need to be handled and/or routed to the proper individual. Extremely fast paced and demanding.  One learns to organize, organize and re-organize. It was never boring."

good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working remotely and the flexibility in schedule.
good,"It was wonderful working for Tenet . There I advanced my career in healthcare. I enjoyed working with a team of such supportive people and meeting new people each day.

good,"This company has great benefits and it helps to know someone who knows someone to get your foot in the door. Now that some of the higher ups have been replaced, this companys' management is better than it was before. they pay very fair for whatever position you will have. they DO NOT provide paid holidays or sick days, you will you your PTO for holidays, sick days and vacation. that is the only downfall. Also in the case there is an emergency (ie hurricane, road closing, etc) you will still have to use your PTO if you cannot make it to work or if you want a day off. I have learned so much and can use those skills and knowledge for future employment. The people are great and everyone works together as a team no matter if it is your assigned job or not."
good,"Staffing shortages seem to be a daily issue and puts added strain on the staff that is working. Colleagues are enjoyable to work with. Census is high most of the time with the aging population of the area. Staffing grids need to be changed as the nurse to patient ratio is too high on a daily basis. For a private hospital that is making money, higher pay should be afforded to the hard working staff that is making them that money."
good,Very good job. Always room for advancement. Very busy work environment - management was okay - loved my co-workers - hardest part of job was the daily productivity.
good,"A typical day at work can vary from many patients a day, to very few.  My manager is very caring and we have a lot of autonomy under the care of the provider.  This is a great place to work if you are looking for part-time employment."

good,I enjoyed working at the hospital. I learned a lot of new skills.
good,"This was a sub-acute facility which was clean and organized and a great stepping stone from college to new graduate nurse in practice.  I learned care plans, wound and ulcer care, enteral feeding and tube care.  I like the same patients daily it helped the consistency of care to master a procedure."
good,I worked for NSMC under the supervision of an amazing women! She was so determined and smart she helped to teach me drive and work ethic and ambition.

She believed in growth and helping her staff become what they truly were meant to be.
good,"I worked in the Food Services Dept of a Tenet facility. A typical day at work included seeing patients for menu selections, taking patient requests from nursing staff, and preparing patient meals and snacks. With it being my first job, I learned about team work and responsibility. My coworkers were people I will never forget. Being so young when I started, they all took me under their collective wing like a daughter, and were very patient with me. I love them! The hardest part of the job was leaving! I thought I'd be there forever. The most enjoyable part of the job was working everyday with people I loved and respected. It's been over five years since I worked there, and I miss the facility and the people EVERYDAY."

good,Co worker are so caring of each other on the other hand management is verry unfair to employee .The hardest part of the job is collecting money from self pays without insurance because they have no job managegment does not under stand then i get written up. The est part of the job i get to meet new people
good,"Ran front office, prepared supenas, operated switchboard witch was about 15 different lines. handled customer inquiry for 4 major hospitals."
good,"•	Vacuumed rugs and carpeted areas in offices, lobbies, and corridors."
good,"The staff are great to work with the benefits however, were cut down to bare minimum. The benefits ten years ago and now are totally different."

New company took over the hospital and upper management did not understand how rehab therapy worked, had previously contracted out the services, so initial changes made had negative impact on quality of patient care and decreased morale in the department."
good,ok to work here. many ways to advance. good management and great perks
good,Most important part of the day is making sure that parents are aware of what their benefits are.
good,"Typical night consist of being extremely busy working by myself in a very large hospital where there are many things happening at once. My position really needs to be looked over by Hr cause its very difficult for one person to handle everything asked of one tech. It is a very fun position to do working with extremely professional people with outstanding attitudes and unique personalities. I have learned many things from critical thinking to bettering my time management skills and efficiency overall producing higher levels of productivity throughout my work shift. I have very little interaction with people in my department due to my shift and only spend a half hour with the morning crew. Most difficult part of the job is working by myself and the amount of work expected of me in an almost 400 bed hospital, where on the rest of the shifts a minimum of between 2-5 is staffed. So because of this the rest of the hospital has great respect for me because of the high level of professionalism I maintain and the work I consistently do every night. Best part of my role is knowing the hospital can depend on me to maintain the goals and policies of the hospital and clearly follow all safety procedures for our patients and staff clearly setting me apart from the rest of my staff. The management overall is ok in my department, but is contracted out by a private company and does not seem to be the best for the company overall."
good,"I liked working with people over the phone and walk ins. I enjoyed helping them and most of all hearing thank you, you have been most helpful! :-)"
good,Down side is they dont pay well and now they dont use LVN any more
good,"I truly enjoyed working in the hospital. I made what was taught in nursing school come together if just made it click. Just as my teacher had said. I had great RNs to work with and they taught me well and  allowed me to be a part of their team. I did not feel like an outsider with the night nurses that I worked with.The patient made what I had learned in school come together.Learned how to do assessment, learned about the way pancretitis can make you feel like its the worst pain you could ever have according to one patient. I totally enjoyed working in the medical surgical unit."
good,In this hospital patient care is our priority.  Our patients come first and we make sure that we provide excellent care to our patients. This is  a good place to work.
good,Is a position that I enjoy it needs to be more interactive with the patients for a more rewarding satisfaction that you are helping the patients with your program
good,"Great place to work as a new RN- a teaching hospital provides so many resources to nursing staff. Tenet offers an anniversary bonus instead of a sign-on bonus, which is nice because it promotes loyalty to the Tenet system."
good,Very busy ER.  Staff not consistent.  Management tried to run the department appropriately but administration constantly stepped in and over ruled different approaches.
good,ThIs company culture really keeps you on your toes. Most of the people have really high standards in order to show utmost professionalism almost to a fault because everyone was so resereved that it was hard to get close to anyone.
good,"Good working place, super busy. I enjoyed my work at Frye, Management was not fair at all times, so that is why I decided to go separate ways, wanted professional growth."
good,Overall great company. Management is extremely hands on as far as being flexible with employees. The culture at Tenet is really family oriented. Great company to work for.

good,"Learned a variety of things while working there, made friends and felt welcomed everyday. Assisted patients, nurses and helped families with information. Took vital signs, documented and recorded intake, out take, vitals and other symptoms into medical records. Worked with unit clerk doing clerical work as well as telephone operations.

good,i enjoy going in to work knowing I am going to make someones day a little brighter. I enjoy my unit and my coworkers are great. We strive to make a difference. The management is understanding and they walk through to make sure we don't need anything and always ready to lend a helping hand. I guess the hardest part of the job is the parking lot!! Seem like miles away. But can't complain to much because employee parking is free!
good,"It has been a good fit for me and my family to this point in time. My co-workers are wonderful, hard working people that inspire me and everyone they come in contact with."
good,Tenetheatlh recently purchased Vangaurd and is now a massive conglomerate.  Coupled with Dell Services and you now have an extremely massive entity that is struggling to maintain control.
good,"Typical day is double checking new patient files for the day, registering the new patients, and scheduling the next appointments.  Assisting patients in any way we can is also part of the responsibility as well as answering the phone, verifying  insurance.  The best part of my job is talking with the customers and getting to know them and watching their progress as they go through therapy.  I've learned the most about insurance since it was the area I needed to learn the most about.  I work with the greatest group of therapist everyone is friendly and helpful."
good,First time working as a supervisor at St.Chris for Children's. I love working in the office making sure all the diets and meal plans were accurate. I had a good group of employees that I supervised and I enjoyed working with them all.

Efficiently input patient demographic information, and positive daily customer service in a fast pace atmosphere keeping focused on prioritizing duties effectively to help operations run smoothly. Implementing hospital policies along with HIPPA and EMTALA laws without Supervision.  Learning new information about our changing healthcare Insurance daily.  The hardest part would be standing for long periods throughout the day and the most enjoyable is spending it with great co-workers who help make the  work environment a  pleasant experience."

good,"A typical work day was routine somewhat, had a good staff who knew their job, finding solution when the odds are against you.. What I learned is, that you don't have management support when you do the job you was asked to do, when it involves certain individuals. Structure is what needed not emotions to operate a organization. My coworkers was out standing more dominate female to male 12 to 2, there was social issues. The hardest part of the job was not the job itself ,but as coordinator, having to deal with bipolar personalities, amongst each other and some manipulation or bucking the system causing disorganization with in the imaging department as a whole. The most enjoyable part of the job is providing patient care and assurance, even though the system dropped the ball , having my technologist feel good about doing a honest day work and being appreciated, which they didn't mind working harder if I needed them to."
good,Management was poor. Finances were poor which made an unstable work environment. Workplace culture was poor. No learning opportunities. Very hard place to work.

good,"Typical work day is monitoring surveillance cameras, conducting reports of investigation and incidences. I learned numerous amounts of skills dealing with Security. Management is very poor when it came to confidentiality and leadership. The workplace culture all depends on you as a person and the type of workplace you want to work in. The hardest part about the job would have to be dealing with clients that are upset with certain situations that are out of your control. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know other employers and having that role to keep the hospital safe/"
good,The work is varied. Medical and surgical cases come in to our ICU. A lot of learning experiences. Can move around to different departments if desired. It offered varied kind of difficult cases to take care of. Give extra incentive by allowing to work extra on a different paycheck.

I have learnt more about the hospital environment, the workers, their clients and how each department contributes to the hospital. I have very hard working co-workers who act as a team to get the job done to ensure that the hospital stays clean and sanitary. I do not consider my ""job"" as hard... I consider myself and hard working employee, determined to do my best and complete all jobs assigned to me. The most enjoyable part of my job would be meeting new people, making them smile and ensuring that I keep the hospital germ free."

good,"I worked at the South Campus which is psych.  It is a whole different world from the main hospital.  The staff there are easy to work with, the patients are a little more tough.  Working with drug addictions and psychiatric issues is draining, but the staff stick together and work together to keep everyone safe.  I worked 3 12-hour shifts a week, and I enjoyed the work."
good,"Overall, this place is a great place to work if you like small hospitals. There isn't much of an advancement for a RRT, but if you like comfort this is the place for you."

good,"Tenet is a great place to work.  The environment is very professional, and everyone is expected to deliver and pull their weight.  Under performers are let go.  The pay is good, but that's also because they expect the best.  The leadership is quite solid, and learning from the leadership is one of the best parts about the job.  We can work from home much of the time.  One of the toughest parts of the job is the fast pace and how much there is to learn and ground to cover, but that can also lead to a great feeling of accomplishment."

Write down my report. Plan my day as much as possible. Check orders . Respond to Emergencies.

good,every morning I would come in and I would print out the reports. I then would start by putting every thing in date order of when it needed to be paid. I then would scan them into the system and then file the paper work. On Tuesday's and Thursday's I would do a check run. I would make sure all the bills were paid. I did enjoy my co works not all but most of them. We all worked together and worked as a team. the hardest part of the Job was dealing with the hospitals and not getting there bills paid due to no one would approve them. Patience is a virtue.
