bad,"Las metas de ventas era demasiados altas, y por un peso que se quedara abajo no te daban nada así llegaras al millón de ventas."
bad,"The management has zero interest in you — they’re only concerned with themselves, their legacy, their pride. "
bad,Paid min wage for fast paced training with little to no support. Was hired as CSR and after a month offered trainee position with new software that didn’t work properly.
bad,"New Manager from Voya came in and completely ruined the company culture. He was rude and did not have any clue on how to properly manage a team let alone himself. He was late, he was rude, he was belittling and continually checks up on female coworkers social media accounts for his own pleasure."
bad,"Other Peers were rude and not pleasant to work with. They would constantly tell on everything, Kiss butt to the upper management to get what they wanted."
bad,"Not a good company by any measure. Low pay, long hours, no training, weak management, favoritism runs deep, knowledge by their ""experts"" is low, and there is no support or culture that inspires a long-term career, especially on the sales / financial representative side of the house. The Denver office is the worst. Omaha and Lincoln offices aren't any better. These guys need to blow up the existing model and start from scratch. Don't waste your time working for this company."
bad,"these slave drivers dont care for you, they want numbers and make sure you know you are replaceable. working in grand island or a satellite office outside of Iowa expect to make 10-15% less than your on site Iowa counterparts. expect to find hundreds of life long career employees still working entry level jobs because there is no such thing as advancement here."
bad,"This company does not do well to attract top talent, which is surprising given it's located in the sleepy city of Des Moines, Iowa. The interview process was very cold and impersonal. Any business analyst can do better with another company."
bad,"Somos Agentes Independientes "
bad,This is the most stressful place I have ever worked and I was in the military during a time of war.  They are not family oriented and will not hesitate to let you go.  My department went thru 13 people in 1 month.  You must bid for your shift every 2 months and you get what you get.  Do not recommend.
bad,Toxic environment. No management support. Horrible vocabulary used regularly. The hardest part of the job was lack of training and support. The most enjoyable part of the job was quiting.
bad,"Slave labor environment management chained you to your desks, EXTREME unrealistic productivity goals, every day is push, push, push never any help from management to jump in and assist the team or department! NO positive feedback ever from management, just criticism!  HIGH TURN OVER RATE!"
bad,"Political, favoritism, and HR only protects the company not the employees. I was bullied and belittled by management only to have HR tell me that they have had the same complaints about the same people and there was nothing that they could do about it. Watch your back because if you are new, they will be out for you"
bad,"I once asked for a little more help or training to help me do my job better and was told someone would help me the following week.  The next Monday, the agency through which I was assigned the job called me and Principal informed the agency that they were ending my assignment.  I had asked for extra help, didn't get it and was let go."
bad,"Talking to your co-workers about retirement, the upcoming cubs game, or the principal classic.  If you are management or are one of their special people. Come in at 9 sit down for 15 go have coffee, scurry off to nonsense meeting. Sit and fumble with your new IWatch that you are unable to figure out. Go have a two hour lunch. Come back and belittle your staff for their inability to decipher what is really desired about your inability to make any decision. Go get more coffee, laugh about the evening plans.  Cut out around 3:30 because hey you sent two emails and did about 15 minutes worth of work."
bad,"Productivity is the main concern; little personal development; Micro-management; Metrics and numbers are what matters to management. If you like the metrics and production numbers, then this is a good position."
bad,"Poca valoración hace el ejecutivo, se trata de ganar+ para el jefe directo y a su vez el siguiente, presionan a tal grado de sobajar a la gente y meterse en su vida privada"
bad,es una mala empresa pues es dificil comisionar u cuando lo logras es muy poco lo que se gana a[arte no hay ningun apoyo de gerente ya que el gerente tambien hace el trabajo de un asesor y obvio siempre esta ocupado en sus tramites.
bad,"Principal Financial Group offers great  opportunities for individuals who want to live in a small city but work for a large, global company.  Each business unit and the central business units (marketing, law, finance, etc.) each have their own cultures and offer different opportunities.  In recent years, the company has tried to create a new, more global, culture by creating community work spaces, eliminating seniority-based benefits and PTO banks and ""empowering"" employees through improved remote work options and flexible schedules.  Some leaders, including some leaders in HR, have been challenged by these changes and have been slow to adapt to empowered employees and a flexible work environment.  Seniority, especially in leaders, is still recognized as superior to leadership skills and performance.  As such, the current environment is challenging and, at times, uncertain."
bad,"You will be doing a ton of cold calling and networking events. Currently there is minimal support, help and direction for new advisors from Senior Advisors and management. You will need to make sure you have plenty of funds in a savings account to help pay your bills for the first few years while you build your practice."
bad,"A place to work where you can have a high floor and low ceiling. You are employee number (e.g. 144). Company doesn't hire from within. Bureaucracy central. If you want to move up, you have to move away and come back. HR is cheesy and fake."
bad,Siempre andan haciendo trabajos urgentes porque no planean bien y andan buscando culpables de lo mal hecho
bad,"Worse management team I have every worked for. Poor technical knowledge and people skills are practically non-existent. Quality, workplace culture, employee satisfaction, etc... only given lip service with no real interest in addressing issues."
bad,the managers just micro manage everyone. They want you to be a mindless robot.
bad,"The environment was extremely toxic. I went through more managers/supervisors than the number of years I worked there. They follow the guideline of “it’s my way or the highway” and they fire people faster than you can blink. Instead of hiring and training new people they demand excessive mandatory overtime with no extra breaks, incentives, or thank-you."
bad,"Principal itself is a good company.  Especially if you are a manager.  The management especially mid level does nothing to contribute to the success of the company.  They are extremely disconnected and rarely even work at all.  They run teams with the extremely minimal employees and expect everyone to work 50+ hours per week year round.  They treat employees like garbage and that they can easily replace the employee with someone else.  They limit the PTO time you can use and when you use it they become upset.  Overall, the pay is average and benefits are okay.  I think it would be a much better place to work if senior management would be more involved and stop promoting terrible middle management."
bad,Average employee is not valued. No chance of advancement. Not everyone is chosen to work with new technologies. Leaders leave a lot to be desired. Some leaders have no technology background. Good pay and benefits.
bad,"I have worked there a total of 13 years. Raises are very low (<1%), and they keep taking away benefits, like how the pension is calculated, which is never in your favor. Promotions are rare unless you are already in the C-suite, then they justify salary increases by promoting themselves. Management is out of touch - talking about spring breaks/vacations/their Lexus while the average worker struggles because of the sub-inflation raises."
bad,"Culture is 180 degrees different from prior to the company going public.  Somewhat understandable because of the pressure of being a public company, but not as enjoyable of a place to work"
bad,"Principal Financial es un Bróker aquí en la localidad, lo que te da de inicio no tener un contrato , solo eres parte de un grupo de colaboradores, cobras comisión por traspaso, reportas a hacienda, y no tienes ningún tipo de prestación, si por alguna razón un cliente se cambia de administradora antes de un año, te sancionan tu comisión, y la empresa en rendimiento no ha hecho algo para llamar la atención, ya que la gente por rendimiento se cambia aunque no entienda ni por cual ley se va a pensionar, obvio esa es la labor del Asesor que tengan un amplio conocimiento para cuando llegue la edad de su pensión, o bien en el trascurso de su vida pudiera suceder algún  acontecimiento como invalidez, o enfermedad o desempleo.}"
bad,"On a daily basis I work within a team environment but also manage a case load in which I am 100% responsible for. I project manage, relationship manage, train, educate, analyze complex situation, and retain high client satisfaction."
bad,"The greatest issue I experience is psychological safety. I am out of the loop most of the time on what management plans to do (hire/fires). Peers experience retaliation for honest feedback. There is a lack of direction, and little to no encouragement or support. My stress levels are too high and not sustainable and it is difficult to focus on my work because of that. Additionally, there is a focus on working with counterparts in India. This requires either early morning hours (6 - 8am) or late evening (11pm)  hours, with very little time overlap (an hour, two, max per day). The expectation is to do this and 'be successful'. This was never mentioned as a requirement in my interview process and would have influenced my decision on whether to come to Principal."
bad,"The manager was a hard taskmaster. We had to process so many claims per hour, people were getting burned out. We had a lot of lunches brought in to keep the workers happy."
bad,Call all your friends who don't need an advisor.They do pay you a pittance while training but beyond that unless you have a following don't kid yourself like I did
bad,The team I was on was great until I met the manager. She seemed nice at the start but than something changed and no matter what I could do nothing seemed right in her eyes. There was just a lot of things going unnoticed and when I brought things to her attention nothing was getting done.
bad,"prospectar en la calle empresas, verificar datos del posible cliente explicación de los beneficios de su afore como activar sus seguros tomo de datos verificar donde se encuentra su afore del cliente dar plan para el retiro"
bad,"Commissioned based job. It is amazing how bad the business is organized, how terrible the technology is and bad the support is from the home office. I spent more time trying to fix issues with IT and fighting with compliance/others than actuallly working!"
good,"No volvería a trabajar en AFORES"
good,"Enjoyable working with advisors, clients, and retirement plan participants.  Direct management and management above her created an environment amongst our team where many did not trust her leadership skills.  There was only one focus within organization and creating client loyalty and retention was not priority."
good,"Existía un buen ambiente laboral hasta que llegó un nuevo Gerente de Operaciones, el cual venía de AFP Habitat. Cero liderazgo."
good,Management was very poor and wouldn't consider the good employees and their potential.Employess are promoted based on preferential treatment and rest are ignored.
good,"en general, las personas encargadas de elevar la productividad, lo quisieron hacer de manera hostil, hostigando y haciendo referencia a situaciones no profesionales, involucrando la situacion familiar y economica. "
good,"Strong, global company."
good,"Es una buena empresa quien le da dirección al negocio en el tiempo que permanecí la rotación de altos mando es mas de 100% no hay permanencia laboral y poca oportunidad de crecimiento claras muy claras las metas y objetivos complejo muy confuso su sistema de pago, el cual desmotiva constantemente a la fuerza comercial, su ambiente laboral es muy alternante existe nerviosismo y psicosis de despido."
good,"sin definiciones concretas, un área de RRHH prácticamente inexistente, lo que provoca cero cultura dentro de la organización"
good,As a whole Principal is a great company.  Unfortunately the Management in my department would tell us what we wanted to hear but did nothing to change difficult situations or find solutions to ease the stress and workload.
good,There was a merger with another company and the job culture and management style changed so that the work environment was not a comfortable situation.
good,"Genaracion de validacion de datos seguimiento telemarketing, visitas en la empresas explicacion de afore dar asesoramiento basado en las leyes del imss e isste."
good,"*El equipo de trebajo en cuanto a lo material es muy limitado, cambian constantemente de planes de metas y bonos sin previo aviso."
good,"Management does not actually care about your opinion. They ask over and over but never truly take it to the table. Everyone in this company has to ask someone else for permission to do something. Trainers are puppets and have no ability to make decisions that are best for the people they're training. Managers blow smoke about assisting with issues, they're slow to respond. Some trainers are lazy, no response, no assistance. Sit through a 2 hour training and then guess what? YOU CAN DO IT ALL... not! Very disappointing that one of the top employers has such low concern for employees. Employees across roles talk nasty towards one another and there is no etiquette when communicating. Principal is almost too big and you'll just be a worker bee doing what someone tells you with no explanation or understanding of why, even when you've asked over and over."
good,"Definite lack of support growing and maintaining your business. "
good,"HR: Go above and beyond to find domestic and inter national reasons to lower your salary."
good,"Cada dia apendo algo diferente pues mi trabajo no es tanto convivir con compañeros sino citas con clientes de los cuales siempre aprendes muevos retos, pues la situacion de cada persona es diferente y de lo cual aprendo dia a dia"
good,"no time to communicate with co-workers"
good,Their training is extensive but it still does not prepare you for the stress that is associated with some of the calls from clients.  They try to create a healthy workplace environment but there is continued required overtime in many departments.  Job requirements are constantly change and you have to be able to adapt to these changes. If you do not take your 15 minute break when scheduled you are penalized or expected to not have your full break.  They do try to compensate with meals regularly catered in  and other extra perks.
good,"Principal is a good sound company to work for.  The culture is definitely focused on the share holder, how quickly things can get done with the least amount of expense."
good,"Aprendí las diferencias entre las leyes 73 y 97,  las estrategias a seguir para llegar a la pensión deseada dependiendo de la ley en la que te encuentres  así mismo como  todo el papeleo y los procesos que son necesarios"
good,"I enjoyed the work in the dental claims department but had a hard time meeting the stat requirements. The work was very interesting and I enjoyed it. However, trying to meet the stats requirements was extremely difficult. It was also difficult to get answers needed to complete work because we were technically only able to ask questions when it was scheduled question time."
good,"PFG is a great place to work for work/life balance but the job itself is pretty boring, can be very hostile when dealing with customers over the phone everyday. Leadership is lacking and there is not a lot of opportunity for growth."
good,"Al iniciar el dia tener visulizado todas las visitas y tiempos necesarios para lograr la meta, es primordial."
good,"Pocos recursos para desarrollar tu trabajo, aun así es una excelente empresa que te brinda mucha capacitación ya cuando te consolidad como asesor Master es poco el apoyo que se necesita para el desarrollo de tu trabajo pero es una empresa de talla internacional."
good,"Aprendí mucho de seguros de vida, APV y FFMM."
good,I believe the company is a decent one to work for but I simply did not care for the job I was doing or the management in my department.
good,"Esta empresa me permitio incorporarme al mercado laboral una vez egresado de la Universidad."
good,"Juntas aburridas y repetitivas, aprendi todo lo de seguridad social y gran parte de la ley,"
good,"The company itself, is a great company! Local management leaves A LOT to be desired!! Phoenix AZ"
good,Buena empresa...estresante en ocaciones buen ambiente laboral
good,There is no base pay for a new agent and the job requires a lot of prospecting.  All income is commissions based with various income based incentive levels. Very good benefits package.
good,The workplace culture was relaxed and family like.  I enjoyed working with the service staff and advisory representatives.  Everybody was pulling together to make the whole system work.
good,Aprendes y desarrollas una gran atención a cliente.
good,Principal Financial Group is a global leader in the financial services and pension industry and has been in the group insurance and pension business since 1941.
good,This company no longer exist at least in SLC. It was an early job for me and I enjoyed it but in the end went out of business and that of course precipitated me moving on.
good,"Salir a prospectar clientes"
good,"Libertad de tiempo para la busqueda de clientes prospectos, dificultad para traspasar trabajadores por no contar con documentacion a la mano. Capacitacion en linea constante para certificarse ante consar, tu administras tus tiempos. Exigencia de meta mensual. No me gusta que no hay salario base"
good,Excelente empresa en cuanto a mucha capacitacion para el buen desempeño del trabajo a desarrollar
good,Great atmosphere with up beat employees that made work very enjoyable. Really involved the employees with decision making. Had a excellent training program.
good,Started off as a great place to work and everyone was cared about by management.  Now we are treated with little respect and all management cares about is how much work they can get out of us.
good,"Answered phone calls regarding EOBs and benefits, made payments on incoming medical claims."
good,I enjoyed my job very much.  It was challenging and diverse. My main focus was case retention and cross-selling while managing existing accounts.
good,"Not applicable"
good,"Reunión diaria con el supervisor para repetir siempre lo mismo, poca retroalimentación, presentación de agenda para el día y de ahí a la calle en busca de los prospectos, regresar por la tarde con tu producción."
good,Principal was fantastic. Hours are flexible and you are left alone to do your job. Lots of fantastic community involvement but the only thing that was disappointing about Principal was the actual job - so boring! 
good,A typical day at work consists of cold calling as many people as you can. Management is very good and helps out as much as they can. The co-workers are friendly and nice. The hardest part of the job is getting clients and finding enough people to cold call. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get to meet with people. I learned an extreme amount about finance and the financial products that are available to people. I also learned a lot about the financial products through the series 6 and series 63 license tests I passed.
good,"Principal is a great company to work for offering many perks. In some departments you'll be offered the opportunity to work from home on occasion, they have great health insurance, an on-site pharmacy, free parking ramp parking, and cafeteria's (including Starbucks) in multiple buildings. When it comes to culture, I can't help but notice an overwhelmingly amount of white people. There are tiny groups of Asian people, Indian people, hardly any black people and a gigantic sea of white people. (This is coming from a white person, btw). The claims department is the most miserable department I have ever worked in. The job itself isn't bad, it's the management and ridiculous expectations to know everything all at once. They reassure you that they're understandable people and will help you after training but fall flat on that promise then load you up with claim after claim. You can ask questions but you'll be given a hurried answer since everyone is too busy to stop and help. I have never met a group of workers more stressed out and irritable than this group. The turnover rate is extremely high for a reason. They have 3-4 training groups per year to replenish the people constantly leaving like clockwork. It's sad because Principal as a company is absolutely great! The perks are hard to beat but this particular department is just sad all around. I left them last year and don't recommend anyone work there unless you're young, fresh out of college, no kids, and no life that can handle all of the stress."
good,"As much as Principal tries to be a ""hip"" place to work at, it is certainly still a corporate environment.  Depending on which department you end up, will determine who much flexibility you have.  Overall, still a decent place to work at."
good,"In an advisor role, you have a very flexible work environment because you are essentially your own boss.  Principal provides a nice array or resources in this model that will help you close business.  They also provide a Statutory Employee structure which allows a W2 benefit model.  This helps reduce tax liabilities for the self employed."
good,Un ambiente agradable para trabajar con alta carga laboral. Los horarios se extienden de forma repetitiva sin compensación por horas extras. Es altamente exigente lo que permite desarrollar habilidades de forma continua y a gran nivel.
good,"Good company. Culture is changing though trying to adapt and attract a younger workforce. Culture is becoming more anonymous, and seems intent on modernizing, making workplace feel sterile and impersonal."
good,"Was able to function in many roles and learn valuable skills. Great people and benefits, but once the company went public, layoffs started and continued for 2 years."
good,Fun company to work for. They had some fantastic benefits such as free chair massages once a week. It was a great job until they decided ti close the office and lay everyone off..
good,"Coming from educational type of employment this was my first taste of corporate work.  We were in what you could call a cubical farm, you only saw the walls around you and the tops of your co-workers heads."
good,"Inicio "
good,"We have good management, a lot of people who are willing to help others. Principal is a  good place to work. We have a good work life balance with flexible hours."
good,"Si bien es la afore que mejor paga en el mercado, carece de cultura laboral y de personal que sea capaz de desarrollar su trabajo con eficiencia, eres solo una estadistica y se deshumaniza al asesor en pensiones."
good,"I have been very happy with the direct management in my department at Principal. I feel that my manager takes time to understand her employees and is a genuinely caring person. The actual job tasks, which consist almost exclusively of repeating the same interview questions from caller to caller, are unfortunately very dull and often tedious. Additionally, the department has very little in the way of upward mobility, with the only advancement options being to leave for a related department within the wider business unit. If it is not the job for you then you will quickly find yourself feeling trapped at a dead end. This has led to quite high turnover in the years I have been here, which leads to mandatory overtime during busy hours because of short staffing and the relatively slow process of on-boarding new employees."
good,Although I am hired through Principal I don't really get to experience the work life as a Principal employee because my  office is in Montefiore Medical Center
good,Good people to work with and learn from. Management really didn't understand the nature of the day to day. Also ocassionally petty. Good growth opportunities and mix of perspectives.
good,"I worked as a Dental Claims Analyst. Although the position itself was not a good fit for me, overall the company is a great place to work and had great benefits."
good,Aprendi el gusto y habilidad por las ventas. Buen ambiente de trabajo.
good,Great work life balance. They mean it. But you don't always have the tools and support you need to do your job well. Field offices are an after thought which is awesome or horrible depending on the situation.
good,Aprendi a ser responsable ya que fue mi primer trabajo en una empresa seria y lider en su ramo.
good,"Principal is a solid employer that provides numerous benefits to employees, such as flexible work schedules, health/ wellness checkups, free workout facilities, and strong emphasis on volunteering in the community.  Co-workers are professional and friendly."
good,Your experience at Principal completely depends on the department - which is unfortunate. Wish it could be the same across the board. Good flexibility in one department and WFH options after 1 year. Next department offered no flexibility. Pay seemed low for what I was responsible for in both positions
good,"I really enjoyed working with Principal. The location, benefits and culture are amazing. I just wished they knew how to use my best skills while I was there."
good,"I was only there a short time.  My job was all about meetings."
good,I was able to learn many skills and worked with some great people. Some management issues with managers that show favoritism among co workers. The hardest part of the job was being able to continue to advance and have the support of management.
good,Principal Financial Group
good,"Empresa seria y comprometida, se cumple con lo que se promete y hay oportunidad de crecimiento"
good,"Es complicado siempre estas en campo buscando clientes o en la oficina en cursos muy largos el ambiente es un tanto pesado,ya que los jefes todo el tiempo te estan presionando."
good,"They treat the employees in a respectful way.  I never felt judged as I have a lot lately.  No one talked religion, politics and anything else that is inappropriate."
good,Overall a great company with great people. Great work life balance with an opportunity to advance. Very extensive and well thought out training program
good,"Es una pesima empresa, tardan en pagarte hasta 2 meses, no respetan lo establecido en el contrato, se aprovechan de los vendedores y asesores,"
good,"Llegar a la oficina, escuchar la junta, los objetivos por parte del jefe y luego ir a prospectar."
good,"Principal itself is a great company. Very good benefits but my department needed help. Work life balance was a joke, although flexibility in the job was good. Pay increases were rarely greater then cost of living."
good,Un buen lider saca provech de las habilidades de sus empleados para beneficiar a la empresa y a nosotros
good,it is up to you to learn and figure everything out. It isn't a job they will train you on.
good,"es la mejor de las afores respecto a la informacion que debes de tener para pensionarte,siento que la marca le falta promocionarse mas y asi vender.  Y tener mas sucursales."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, con companeros del mismo rango, no muy buena con personal de alto rango, companerismo, y algunas ocasiones hermetismo en la informacion importante para el desarrollo del personal."
good,There is no work life balance! Its so hard to work here and have a life/kids/husband. I will have to quit once I have my first baby because they are not willing to work with me on a flexible schedule.
good,"Financial services company, I have nothing bad to say about them, they treated me quite well in the position that I was in. Unfortunately my personal situation would not allow me to continue."
good,"Great company, competitive pay and great benefits. A typical day consist of building relationships and trust with brokers.  Working closely with sales representatives."
good,Great place to work. Super employee oriented. A lot of outings and team building exercises. I would recommend working there to a friend. Big company with a lot of room to move around.
good,"La empresa es buena, los gerentes son pésimos lideres en apoyo al personal, los números en cualquier trabajo en ventas son necesario, pero la motivación no esta dentro de ello para conseguirlos."
good,"Recibir  llamadas  de  clientes  inconformes   con el servicio  de afore"
good,"Workers were friendly and company would have parties, food days and games. Insurance was moderate. Parking was awful not allowing enough spaces or lots for all of it's people."
good,"No cuenta con prestación de fondo de ahorro el"
good,Están muy enfocados en la prospección y presionan mucho a los empleados y el tramite es pesado
good,A team-centric environment that gives you the support needed to build a successful business. Senior advisors are willing to help on virtually all appointments.
good,Empresa con pagos de comisiones bajos en comparacion con el mercado de afores y mucha exigencia de parte de mandos directivos.
good,Great work environment and the training is great. One of the best working environments I've had. Everyones willing to help and the companies been around for a very long time so its not going anywhere any time soon.
good,"-por las mañanas junta y despues a prospectar o visitar clientes"
good,You were always given the tools needed to do the job. The people were wonderful and always happy
good,"Very supportive company from top to bottom.  Provided amenities beyond the work tasks that made it a ""city"" within the company."
good,"Principal Financial Group is a pleasure to work for, however, there is not any opportunity for advancement."
good,"Es fácil y sin complicaciones comunicarse con jefaturas y gerencia, en un ambiente grato laboral."
good,"Principal was a good place to work, and i enjoyed assisting all of the office agents and there staff to be more successful in there individual businesses."
good,"Productive and fun place to work. Good opportunities to move within departments. Flexible schedule. Good management. Plenty of Employee Benefits and company amenities, Insurance, Paid time off, Onsite cafe's, Gym."
good,A great place to work overall! I loved working with my leaders and mentors. It has been well worth being there. It was such a learning advancement for myself.
good,My co-workers were the best people I could have ever worked with.
good,"Good management, products and services that focus on helping clients successfully navigate the retirement course."
good,Handling inbound calls assisting customers with logging into their accounts. Some days calls were back to back others there would be five minute intervals between calls.
good,Long-standing company in the industry. Many opportunities. Evolving with global growth. Have had numerous opportunities to experience different roles and areas of tbe company.
good,"Principal Financial Group was a decent place to work. A changing work environment provided many opportunities for growth. If you have the chance and get the opportunity, work there."
good,"Great benefits, Lot of PTO"
good,Las plataformas de trabajo proporcionadas no eran las idóneas. Esto dificulta y atrasa el proceso de la labor.
good,"In my position, I had at least 6 - 8 meetings per week, which can be frustrating at times. The competition for advancement and recogninition at Principal is fierce. They're currently catering alot to the millineals. Once the company went public (issued stock), the culture changed some -- wasn't so nurturing and employee-focused, but rather bottom line financial performance and shareholder value. "
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar, horarios cómodos que ayudan a una mejor calidad de vida."
good,"Principal, me dio la oportunidad de aprender cosas nuevas, todos los días se llegaba a las 9 A.m y el horario de salida a las 18.30"
good,"I learned how to self motivate, multi-task in multiple programs, and work under very little supervision. Enjoyable part was being able to see the difference in our work volume and with our customers due to same day timing! The team members where great too."
good,The Principal Financial Group is a wonderful place to work. There is room for advancement and learning different parts of the company is always encouraged.
good,"Typical Day starts by reviewing emails that were received overnight, followed by answering call from clients. I have learned extensive knowledge of 401K plans. Balancing time is the hardest part of this job, right now I have 900+ clients that I need to work with. I love the team I work with as they are all knowledgeable, but management is out dated and can not do the job but expects high more from employees then is can be fiscally possible."
good,"During my career at PFG I felt the work environment was challenging in very dynamic work environment.  I was able to transition from 7-8 different teams during my tenure with PFG.  Starting out in z/OS storage, z/OS operating systems, USS on z/OS and then on to the UNIX team to manage the AIX/Linux/SUN server environments."
good,En general calificaria BIEN a la empresa.
good,Typical corporate place to work.  Many different business units.  Never boring.  Not a lot of value placed in experience - seem to promote and hire only young people.
good,Enjoyed my time at Principal.  The work was challenging but rewarding.  I was able to work with some outstanding co-workers and clients. I would recommend to others.
good,they could offer a longer base salary for new hire reps.  They could also train better.  The could hire from within a bit better.  The commission structure could improve also
good,A lot of effort has been made to improve the culture at the company and it has paid off. New branding has seemed to take hold. Overall a good firm in a great city.
good,"Midwest culture is great, efforts are generally those to support clients but board of directors doesn't always seem to see challenges reps in the field see.  That's more indicitive of the industry right now"
good,"Processed medical and dental claims of varying dollar amounts. "
good,"Un día típico es:"
good,Enjoyed while I was there. Company culture is laid back & employees are over-supported.
good,"Very forthcoming on new technology with regards to accounting processes, etc. and ability to sit in on high level projects."
good,Loved this job.  Only reason I left was down turn of economy plus there were minimal advancement opportunities.
good,"Es buena empresa, tiene buenas prestaciones, sin embargo el porcentaje de comisión es baja"
good,In general Principal is a good place to work. Depending what area of the business you are in will greatly impact your salary and range for salary. Great benefit package.
good,"What you can expect at Principal is a solid, productive, work environment. They have a strong commitment to work/life balance. They provide unlimited time off and they have various fun activities planned for the staff. Only real downside is that the company is so big that there is no real advancement. All ""promotions"" are lateral."
good,"it was a good job, felt training could have been better, they expect more of you than you are trained for, on the other hand there were people there to help out"

good,This is a great company. They take good care of their people and really have a passion for the business they conduct. I would encourage any serious professional to give thought to working at The Principal.
good,"Principal Financial Group is a challenging place to work.  This comes from the need to be self motivated in an arena that is hostile to agents.  The average public has a skewed concept of what we do and as a result, the hardest part of the job is finding people willing to meet with us.  This isn't without it's reasons, but the majority of agents are sincere, high integrity persons who genuinely desire to help people protect their families from the unknown.  Once these initial barriers have been breached, the career is a solid, rewarding endeavor."
good,"when I started at this company they were a great place to work, several years later they grew way to fast and they could not keep up.."
good,"Un buen lugar para trabajar, buenas prestaciones y un horario cómodo para poder continuar con tu vida fuera de la empresa. Presenta áreas de oportunidad en cuanto al trato de empleados, es necesario dar un mayor reconocimiento y seguimiento a su desarrollo profesional. Las oportunidades de crecimiento son pocas. El balance entre cosas “buenas y malas” sería favorable."

good,"This is a position where you are your own boss and with any business, the results are the amount of time & effort you put into it. A typical day consists of calling to set appointments, holding appointments, financial consulting & sales, appointment or sales follow up, education/training. Hardest part of this job is calling for appointments and keeping the appointment book full. I truly enjoy working with the public, educating & helping clients to meet their financial goals. In my situation there has been a lot of management & manager changes along with poor communication on other issues creating a negative and unproductive work environment."
good,"La verdad exelente capacitacion, preocupacion por el trabajador, herramientas de trabajo exelentes, comisiones muy buenas"
good,Interning for the Data Science team at Principal was a great experience for me personally but there are some projects that interns worked on where little was actually learned. It can be a great experience or a mediocre one depending on the project you get assigned so be aware.

good,Answering client questions and concerns.  After 25 years the challange was missing.
good,Even you join this company as IT consultant...you will be groomed for leadership position which can take you to places.
good,Principal Financial Group was a wonderful company to work for. They treated their employees well and we all had fun and learned a lot while we were there. It was like going to work with family.
good,Great place to work and very nice office/building environment. Potential for advancement. Management is very motivated in the employees learning new products/skill sets. They have a very metric oriented working environment
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers I worked with.  We had a great team with some very talented staff. To many meetings and not enough work time!
good,This was a good experience as an intern. Unfortunately the company didn't have any open positions in my department when the summer ended so I wasn't offered a job.
good,"buena empresa, sueldo algo por debajo del nivel, buenas prestaciones, ambiente laboral excelente."
good,its a nice company with great work culture. but the Over time situation and resource management is very bad for which employee are going through under pressure every day.
good,"Principal is a wonderful place to work! Great benefits, great people, facility is well kept. Personally did not like the actual job. Thejob was very monotonous and boring as it was a call center."
good,mi evaluacion personal seria saber mas aserca de los temas a tratar para poder dar mejor servicio y mayor convencimiento y ser amable con las persona atento y muy sonrriente
good,"A typical day included myself on the phones doing inbound call work to reset passwords for principal.com and various wellness portals, setting usernames or sending ""set-up links"" so that customers could do so on their own for principal.com or wellness portals, verifying checks, and directing calls to the business unit that could best assist the customers needs. I learned how to handle customers with the correct phone etiquette and how to use Avaya-onex to answer and direct phone calls to the correct Business Units. Management for Principal was very nice and was good about answering questions when you needed it, but they were sometimes very hard to find. If someone had a question on the call and no managers were around to answer, we either had to have the customer hold until someone could answer our question, which could be anywhere from 5-15 minutes or connect them to their business unit for another representative to find their manager. There wasn't much time to get to know other co-workers as we all worked very independently, but it was a friendly atmosphere when we did communicate with each other. The hardest part of the job would be when you're unsure of what to do and you can't find management to assist or receiving a call from an angry customer. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was verifying checks and also assisting cheerful customers in getting logged in."
good,"A typical day at work would include for example financial analysis,  communication between the holding company and the subsidiaries in Brazil, review of the processes and look for opportunities to improve it."
good,Principal Financial Group decided to exit the health insurance business. Their decision resulted in the lose of over 1500 employee's jobs. The hardest part of the job for me was to continue to work for Principal from the time they announced the exit until my release date on 3-28-2013. I had to say good-bye to the friends and co-workers that were released before I was. But at the same time I am very proud to have been one of the last specialist to close down the health division.
good,Principal is a good company specially for those who requires high work / life balance. The company is very flexible when it comes to personal needs. The salary is mediocre but they are slowly trying few new things to retain high performers.
good,"I learned a lot with my managers, who provide the training needed to do this job. One of the aspects about this job that I appreciate is the fact that it is not mandatory that we are at the office everyday."
good,Principal has made a multi-million dollar investment in their employees by updating the entire corporate campus to enable workers to be more collaborative and work in the environment that best suits them.
good,"Al llegar a las oficinas todo mundo te saluda y te sonríen ya que todos tomamos un curso de etica y nos respetamos, me siento en mi escritorio y si tengo un traspaso por realizar me dedico a terminarlo para despues entregarlo y si no tengo empiezo a llamar para prospectar, he re-aprendido a convivir de manera muy sana y agradable ya que en mi anterior trabajo eso se habia perdido, los gerentes te apoyan y te capacitan en todo, ademas que son muy motivadores, me gusta que no tenemos horario de entrada ni de salida, son unas oficinas muy comodas, con aire acondicionado, cafe y galletas, nadie se mete contigo a menos que necesites ayuda en algo, el equipo de computo esta en muy buenas condiciones. y lo mas difícil de este trabajo es lograr contactar la cita con el cliente."
good,"Un dia comun de trabajo era la entrada 8.00 a.m. 8.15 la junta de retroalimentacion de los asesores como les fue el dia anterior , cuantos cierres tuvieron, sus experiencias compartidas con sus compañeros para poder aprender de todos ya que cada cliente tienen casos muy diferentes y hay que darle solucion a sus problemas."
good,Great place to work.Great people and great benefits.I woulod highly recomend this company to work at.
good,"This was the best company ever to work with. I was my own boss and they were there to support me, which they were committed to doing. I was allowed to do what was best for my clients even if that meant going outside the company for product. The ""home office's"" clients were the agents. They had great product and wonderful customer service."

I learned how to manage workflow efficiently as the job was extremely diverse. We were encouraged to think through the processes in place (making suggestions for change as we feltlead) & to work as a team on the tasks at hand. Hardest part of job was probably the continual changes in health ins industry & federal regs we had to comply with. Most enjoyable part of job was the diversity & variety of tasks"

good,Principal is a great company to work for with many great benefits and perks that don't necessarily have a monetary value tied to them. The only down side is that there are a lot of employees who have been here for a long time and sometimes it creates a log jam of people applying for different jobs.
good,"Real Professional environment, great opportunities for networking, grow yourself, lots of professionals help available or guidance step by step. Opportunity to talk to senior management! Prepare your development path and then best part is to work on it as you like or want. Growing opportunities in company! Flexibility of schedule! Motivation for health and fitness. Time to socialize. Bring in your family and friends anytime. Take PTO - no problem! yearly bonus, 401k and health insurance!! Only one thing that I am blessed having a job there!"

good,"Me hicieron sentir mejor que en alguna oficina de colombia, ya que por el dialecto, las palabras y ademanes que utilizaba, para ellos era mas que una curiosidad, era un modo de copiar para su desarrollo personal y profesional, puesto que el vallenato se ha compenetrado tanto en esta ciudad de méxico, que es mas escuchado que el mismo norteño o mariachi. Pude hacer buenos amigos y estaban puestos a colaborar en el aprendizaje mio con relación a lo laboral, aprendí mucho de todos y del trabajo."

good,"Muy buena compañia"
good,"While with the Principal I learned so many skills. I type very fast with few errors and 10 key. My typical day in the short term disability dept would be bring up my claims in my computer and start working them. We each would receive anywhere from 10 to 20 claims per day. we were on a time line to get the claims researched and paid. Typically we were allowed 3 days to get our claims out the door. I would make outgoing phone calls to physicians, hospitals, and the clients for interview's. It was my job to determine if the person was truly disabled and that he/she could not perform the substantial and material duties of his or her job. This job demanded organization skills and world class customer service skills. I also took incoming calls from clients, physicians and hospitals regarding claims. I learned empathy with my clients as well as to be tough as well. I worked well by myself and also in a team. I went up and beyond the call of duty if somebody needed help with their claims as we were a team also. I learned about state laws as well. The hardest part of this job was telling a client that I had to deny their claim for disability benefits. Other then that I totally enjoyed the job. I left only because I chose to leave and move on to more challenges and openings for my career.  "
good,"Many of the financial advisors and other employees show up at the office sporadically. Whenever they're not visiting clients, they have the freedom to show up and get their work done on their own time. I learned that you maximize your earnings when you dedicate more time doing work. One's success depends solely on their own efforts. The co-workers were very helpful and a joy to be around. The hardest part of the job is dealing with so many physical files and folders for clients because of the strict laws of the SEC requiring physical correspondence to be kept on record between advisor and client. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to create your own schedule and the freedom it offers to get your work done at your own convenience. I found that I was much more productive at work when I took leisure at my own convenience."
good,"The Specialty Benefits department was an excellent place to start a career with Principal Financial Group. A typical day at work would be arriving, doing your 8 hours on the phone to assist members, providers, and third parties with specific benefit questions or claims. The management and co workers were a great aspect of the job. It was a very professional calm atmosphere with many resources to help you excell in your position."
