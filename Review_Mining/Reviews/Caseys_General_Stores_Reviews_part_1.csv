bad,"they hire anyone, so if your a dope fiend or theif, then you belong here. my manager successfully hired a meth head who broke into my house the day after christmas and stole from my  kids! along with her being completely unrelatable. also she has the most condescending, ignorant way of putting everyone down. because her way is always better than yours, even if you offer to CLEAN THE OVENS! which nobody had done in months! it was absolutely disgusting and al she could say was that i took too long and if i did it her way, then it would have been done right. Yeah if only i didnt have to scrape 2 years of grease off of the disgusting thing! If i was a health inspector i would have them shut down! also, they even sell outdated food! This was the worst employment experience of my life.  there is also horrible communication between corporate, their field supervisors, management, and h.r. I called the h.r. lady and asked them for a transfer because i didnt want to work around thieves and drug addicts (being clean from drugs for over 6 years myself!) could not be in that enviroment. i mean when the manager did my interview she stated that she didnt care if one of her employees was to have a side job (drug dealer) just that she didnt want it in her store.  Now how is that professional or in any way good for the companys image? i feel very deeply wronged by this company and strongly urge whoever may apply, look at what you have in front of you before making this decision. This is a horribe company to work for"
bad,I felt like I was worked to death. And we weren't even suppose to talk to co workers. I felt like I was in grade school.  I did my work. above and be on. but I left every day in pain from carrying 21 boxes in and out of the cooler. I would cry on the way to work  because I hated it so bad.
bad,This place keeps employees they definitely shouldn't. Very poor management. The manager only cares about himself and not the well being of others. He won't get rid of people that shouldn't be working here
bad,"They interviewed me and promised to work with me on the hours because they needed a 4am girl and I needed 6am and she told me I could have both. "
bad,Casey's hires the worst workers and relies on the good workers to pick up all of the slack. Even if youre sick they make you work or you feel like your job is compromised.
bad,"The poor management of this store has pushed me to seek other employment. Between understaffing constantly and not being able to keep a manager for more than 6 months at a time, the employees are what keeps the store"
bad,Get new management I would not wanna go into a store and see management sitting around with a prune face every time I go in there she looks mean she only speaks to who she knows
bad,They change there minds everyday on how to manage the store and employees. They treat the employees unfairly and don’t care if they are short of staff for shifts.
bad,all of the employees and management are rude and disrespectful. i was there training for only 3 days and i already had a store key and was being left to close by myself. after clearly showing that i wasn’t ready. & then they have the audacity to fire because i called in ONE time. i wouldn’t recommend working here. the casey’s general store in reedsburg is not a place i’d work again.
bad,"Just wasn't the job for me. I'm not much for the constant rush of customers and being the only one to do anything in the store, there were often times when it was just me and a cook."
bad,"Scheduling was always being changed last minute, would work the closing shift (3-12am) and then come in at 7am the next day. Assistant managers were always screaming about how the employees were stupid and lazy. No matter how much extra work I put in (Taking hours off of peoples shifts, deep cleaning the store, asking for training in other areas so I could be more useful, etc.) I was still ""lazy"" and needed to work harder. The store is disgusting and it doesn't matter if you deep clean because you're still lazy. Also there is SO MUCH drama! Constantly had to call the police while working there."
bad,"0 employee confidentiality, Bad scheduling, unprofessional, Doesn't care for employees, 0 chance for employee improvement, 0 chance for employee growth"
bad,The job sucks and they are not flexible with hours and magimnent suck nobody listens to you and everybody pushes everything on the next shift and blames it on someone other than themselfs
bad,"Absolutely would not recommend working here. I did, for about nine months and during that time, I consistently worked full-time hours but was never given full-time status. I also had my shift hours changed without being told about it and would come in to work to a new schedule, frequently having to work more than six days in a row. Management was only concerned with out-doing each other and trying to take the store manager position. Management also had clear favorites and refused to take serious matters to HR, such as offensive language and outright lies about other employees."
bad,"I worked at Casey's General store in Oolitic, and I would have to say it is by far the worst job I have ever worked the employees act like little kids and tell on you for anything they possibly can the manager is by far the worst she is very disrespectful she has threatened to punch me in the mouth she had told me I look horrible when I was very sick and still came into work."
bad,"They only care about themselves, and if you work with another sub shop, you get hired then they use that against you to make you quit or get fired half a year later. Liers, scoundrels, nothing there is ever confidential! No one cares or appreciates how hard you work for their company. And when something better comes along, they trash it! Stay far away from Casey's. Its carupt."
bad,"they are all the same horrible management, poor training and too many hours. always calling trying to get you to work more hours and then get wrote up for overtime. bad environment all around"
bad,"If you like stressful environments, egotistical co workers, and punishment for your best efforts this is the place for you. On the outside, you could look like the star employee, even the customers notice youre a hard worker, but to the management or the following shift you could be god and it wouldn't be good enough. Hope you dont like being rewarded because even a thankyou is a rare sound in this business. Want to do the job of 3 people and barely get paid to do one? You will love it here. Want to be expected to dedicate your life to live and breath gas station and pizza? This is your new favorite place. How about to be bossed around by everyone who isnt a manager? Meet your new family. Hope you love to be miserable because you can kiss your positivity good bye!"
bad,Casey's was a very testing place to work. The manager was not at all fit for the position.  Everything was done sloppy and unprofessional.  My coworkers were the only thing I enjoyed about this job.
bad,Plan on working 8 to 10 hour shifts with no break the management  they look out for their selves not their employees don't work the kitchen or eat frome the kitchen cuz this restaurants are disgusting you would not eat there if you knew how they did their food this was the worst job I ever Had  out-of-date food being served to. the public
bad,It Was unorganized And Extremely Unprofessional And They Scheduled You How They Wanted Never Asked You People Was Always Late Their Was Multiple Workers Stealing
bad,"They have a very large turn over rate. Their answer to the problem is that everyone is lazy and no one wants to work. Except of course them, the management. Well I guess they themselves do have job security. They will hire you for one shift and work you a different one. They try to stick just about everyone with this 3:00 AM to 10:00 AM shift calling it day shift. You are the key holder and there alone for low wages. When you have had enough they will leave voice mails saying your lazy and don't want to work."
bad,Manager and employees are terrible! They will continue to have their own conversations in front of the customers instead of paying attention to the customers.
bad,They don't train their employees right. Very rude to customers and lots of drama no respect for other employees. Best part was getting to be in the cooler.
bad,"The manager lies to employees about advancement opportunities."
bad,The company only cares about making money. All employees are expendable and replaceable. The complete and utter disregard for the care of their employees was truly eye-opening for me. If that’s not reason enough not to work for this company I don’t know what is.  My area and regional managers were rude and treated myself and the other employees as though we were less than. My area manager continued to cut hours for my fellow employees and for myself claiming the store would continue to run efficiently and productively. The store continues to fall apart and is unsanitary and messy. One time a health inspector came in who was not  there to inspect the building but told me that it would not pass an inspection and gave me a list of things to tell the manager as to why it would not pass an inspection. That was just a palling to me. The current manager there is wonderful and continues to try and help his employees but without further funding from the company or help with the store the employees there will continue to quit and the store was slowly falling to ruin
bad,If you don't want to spend time with your family and friends Casey's would be perfect for you. They say they have flex able hours but they don't.  They say they are family store but they are not.
bad,The management was very demanding . I didn't feel like a person . The managers had no respect for each other either it was a stressful demanding environment. There was little to no training before being left on your own . No time off available when sick even for the assistant manager.. I was glad to be let go after I got sick .
bad,"Very poor. Need new job, with better hours. Management is disorganized. Hours are getting cut too much. CO workers attitudes are horrible and manager acts like he does not want to be here half the time."
bad,Manager punished me over favoritism to a family member and let the assistant manager yell and cuss at me. My manager would change the the schedule the week of the schedule and even write you inn on the the schedule that day and then call you and say you had to come in to work even an employee had prove of this as he took a picture of the posted schedule the day before she called him inn to work. the manager made me work two back to back double shifts because she couldn't keep employees then promised me the next 3 days off and still asked if i could come in one of those days and another one of those days said i was scheduled to come in.
bad,Do not work there. Corporate only cares about money. I was told by my manager that I would be changed to full time. Six months later I found out I was considered part-time still and had been working 35-40+ hours a week. went to corporate and they did absolutely nothing. So I had been working full-time hours with no benefits.
bad,worked here for a little over a year and during that time they replaced about half the crew and i had a manager for less than a month of that time. the district manager showed up maybe twice a month. so if you like below average pay and lack of oversight this might be the place for you.
bad,"I worked for Casey’s for 3+ years. I never got a raise, management and corporate treats you like peasants. I got full time after my 3 year mark and ended up quitting. Hard work isn’t worth the pay."
bad,"Managment is horrid, employees are lazy. "
bad,Managment is the worst part there. Not all managment but store managmant and district managment is certainly lacking. They never answer there phones when there is a problem. If you do certain jobs there they expect way to much of 1 person.
bad,This company cares about it's bottom line only.  I left due to the management. I would no longer tolerate being yelled at in front of customers for things I had no control of.  pay is low turn over is high so you are constantly training and time is not given for that nor are hours allocated to train properly.
bad,The Supervisors and District managers in the Oklahoma area didn't show any care for there managers working over 100 hours in 2 weeks. Was employed for 13 years into a company that didnt care when a member of management calls supervisor or ADP for help and you lose your job. Thanks Casey's
bad,Was not a great place to work. Management babied the guys while the women got lectured all the time. Plus I had to relocate due to personal issues and the manager wrote I wasn’t employable through Casey’s. Not fair considering I would be homeless and with a child if I didn’t make this move.
bad,"The store manager was awful. I was doing her job and mine, and she told me that she was going to promote me to the first assistant, but when it came time to, she instead promoted someone who was an old friend of hers, who drank on the job... So I quit. This was after I had been there for over 2 years... They don't let anyone work 40 full hours a week, because they will not pay anyone any benefits. There is no vacation, no sick time, no paid time off, no health insurance, life insurance, no 401k...  The most they let anyone work per week is 35 hours, anything over that they consider overtime, except they don't pay you overtime wages for it. I worked the cashier job, I trained employees, I helped with the order every week, I did inventory, especially the tobacco, I also worked in the kitchen, stocked the coolers, unloaded deliveries, cleaned the whole store, opened and closed... And still they screwed me over when it was time for me to get promoted... I wouldn't tell anyone ever to work there it was horrible in the end... Don't waste your time."
bad,It Is a horrible place to work ! I can’t express how much unneeded stress the job has. I loved my costumers. But the higher ups are horrible no consistency
bad,"Got fired for stealing milk, wasn't thinking, offered to pay for it and they didn't care. I mean...it was milk, co workers were fine, management only cared about their own goals."
bad,The manager was unprofessional. The employees had. No work ethic. People selling drugs in the parking lot. Nothing was ever ready for customers to eat
bad,Not a good place to work company doesn't care about employees all they care about is profit they treat like a dog customers lie about complaints against employees and the stores are dirty good that is dropped on floor is used on customers food order they use out dated food for customers orders the trash cans are never cleaned out they are disgusting
bad,"I loved working at Caseys at the start, we had a decently full staff and good management. As the months went on we lost more employees than gained and overall morale plummeted. I believe my application for management is still pending almost six months after applying"
bad,no one listens to anyone they do as they please you get wrote up for he said she said thing. It is worse than drama in a high school. no breaks basically
bad,"Not all Casey's are ran the same. However the one I worked for, hired me under false pretenses and lies. Management was a complete joke. Employees were untrained, rude, and arrogant. I would never recommend this job to anyone ever."
bad,"Was harassed by co worker from start of job. I let it go, then later fired from manager who lied about the co worked being dealt with, Then told I was harassing her by telling others how she ignored me and cussed at me from start of job. How is telling co workers a person is ignoring my work related questions harassment from me? Feel they were not worth time to fight about it and was set up. I forgive them and pray to God about it all. Then moved on. Review asked I tell truth. Sure other stores are fine just manager was not professional at all about the whole thing. Other worker was telling me he wanted to hit customers all the time, and also was trying to get me to steal doughnuts like he was doing. Just avoid these people is my recommendation!"
bad,Its just a job. It doesn't pay you by your experience. You will start at the bottom of the barrel. They don't have staff to work as a team. To me management is only there for themselves.
bad,They never cleaned or kept up with the customers needs. I had to. Which thank God I made store Leader or that store would be run down by children. Pretty much. I love Casey's jus don't love how it's being ran. End of story. Have a nice day
bad,They continually failed to deliver on promises regarding proper safety equipment and steady work schedules. Management lacked basic work ethics and failed to keep personal information private. I was injured on multiple occasions due to lack of safety equipment. Management was abusive.
bad,The manager at Casey's don't do anything besides sit in the office and watch his other employees work . That is not a team effort. Where is the previous manager at?  The girl that works in the kitchen has the nastiest attitude of all always talking about people. Cashier's are respectful but that kitchen lady that always have an attitude   not good at all she's normally there in the morning time
bad,"We have had horrible management since they opened up the store. My son hates going there. The management gives attitude and refuses to hire anybody full time so you don't get benefits. The manager gave me attitude and then threatened to ban me from the store. Terrible service as a customer or employee, you get treated poorly either way."
bad,I liked working there but was treated poorly I had amazing employees to work with but the management was horrible I did like working there I was just always disrespected
bad,It sucks working at Casey's you get harassed manager still take you off the schedule and time she feels like it she makes other managers fire you she keeps nothing in house she does something wrong she blames it on you it's just a miserable place to work other people who do things that they're not supposed to but when you go do it she talks to you but not them best tip that I can give you if you can't do for yourself Casey's is great for you but if you could do for yourself go find a better job do you like to kiss but cases is the place for you
bad,If corporate only knew how lazy management is they wouldn't be happy.  She just leaves freezers of ice open even while closed cuz she can't find the locks.   Everyone who quits has a key to the place and she doesnt ask for it back.  She complains to all the vendors how exhausted she is.
bad,If you like being demoralized and treated like you have no meaning in this world and it's the job for you.the management constantly critiques you on how you should do your job while they sit in the office drug deals are done outside the store while Management is knowing and participation. Constantly told to cover a shift or face ridicule from the whole store while others were allowed to see fit to show up due to their affiliation with the owner and boss
bad,"Was 4 months pregnant at time of leave, manager had favorites, terrible attitude, never wanted to cover a shift if someone called out, very rude to some workers who were not her favorite, wanted pregnant women to lift more than 50lb. Always changed the schedule last minute, called you in on your day off. Called out one time for sickness, one time used GPS to search my area to see if i was lying about traffic in the area, terrible manager."
bad,"Be available to work 24/7 . No reasonable scheduling all 3 shifts in 7 days. People quit with no notice, ever or are asked to leave without any replacement."
bad,"There are so many issues here I am not even sure where to begin: -Assistant Manager smells so bad at 6-8 feet away it churns your stomach"
bad,Corporate watches every store from the location in Iowa so if it blizzards here they make the call whether or not you go home management is very poor they won’t let you talk about anything personal that could affect your work instead they write you up until they don’t need you anymore I highly suggest to not support or work for this company
bad,"Do not recommend this job to anyone ."
bad,"Store manager picks favorites, 2 faced, doesnt do her job, and expects people to do her job for her, allows one of her cashiers to talk bad about the other employees to customers, refused to move said employee to another shift since I was targeted...I had to leave because it wasnt corrected...I hope corporate reads my review and takes this into consideration....doubtful though..."
bad,My manager was completely scatterbrained did nothing all day but watch cameras and good off he contradicted himself all the time. Nobody was happy ever when they were at work. It was the worst first job in the world!
bad,"The people I work with are great!! Corporate doesn't care about there employee's, you are just a body nothing more. Managers only "
bad,Working at Casey's might work for someone else but the management there was really bad and I think since I work with them that they could have worked with me when I needed them to
bad,This was the worst place ever. The management and area supervisor was the worst part of the job. The hours were not to bad but getting stuck working every weekend got old. The manager loved to start rumors about you. Area supervisor plan as soon as she got the position was to fire you. The fired the best manager for no reason. I dont recomend this job
bad,I hated working there. Corporate doesn't know how to run a store in a small town. Management didnt have enough training to know how to run the store.......
bad,"Started at 8.50. Two years later at 9.50. Only person in kitchen on nite 4:00 pm - 11:00 pm. Expected to make ,cook ,cut ,box , pizza and whatever else ordered. Online orders took presidence to called in orders.  Also answered phone calls for orders which takes away from preparing, cooking and cutting and boxing. Then you have all dishes to do and put away. Kitchen had to be totally clean including mopping floors. And taking out garbage. Empty garbage outside by pumps and door. Then off to restock cooler with beer from shelf to cooler and restock all shelves in cooler. Sure I forgot something! But for 8.50 an hour or 9.50 now I believe to start sure not an easy job!"
bad,"You can be there for 2 days, or 5 years; if a single sour customer files a corporate complain (FALSE OR NOT) you are gone. No questions asked. You are not valued at Casey’s. The basic crew members are just as expendable as their management, even up to the GM. "
bad,Casey's  as a company is a fair  place to work. Now the store where I worked  not so much.  Do to how management is running the store. Too much favoritism going on at that store.
bad,"Won't work for a manager that gossips about employees, with other employees.  No structure, no training.  People go to work with ""it's just a job"" attitude.  Too many employees whine to customers about their problems and they don't do their job tasks, and management did nothing to correct this."
bad,"I was fired for attending my son's  birth. Corporate is completely out of touch with their employees. I was working 90+ hours a week, and the only person in the store that was allowed overtime. And I wasn't allowed to cross train employees."
bad,"Management is a joke. The ad says flexible hours. That is total garbage. They said you can have time off, they lie. Working for Casey's was the biggest mistake in my life."
bad,The store I  worked at was very dirty and disorganized.  Only 1 cash register working so when shift change customers had to wait for door to be counted out then next person could work
bad,Caseys needs to get new management right away or that store will close w in a year. They suck horribly and havw many many many calls to corporate already and just opened n December!!
bad,"Job was very time consuming, hard to find good help. Expected you to work way to many hours for way too little pay. I would never work here again. Very unappreciative place"
bad,This was by far the worst job I’ve ever held. Store was always disgustingly dirty. Poor manager poor district manager. Rude employees and I would not recommend people to eat from their kitchen.
bad,"As far as management goes they have separate rules for every employee. I have seen people steal food, cigarettes, gas out of here and sit in the there cars and never do there jobs, and get away with it, and then others get wrote up or fired for the same things. Some employees work their butts off while others do nothing. They are to do reviews once a year, but when I left they were 5 months behind. This review would lead to a whole ten cent raise. This place is the definition of insanity. I have also seen people hired because they are friends of the manager who was demoted for the sole purpose of being an assistant manager; without considering other employees who were interested in the position who had been there for years."
bad,"the store manager would play favorites with employees that she liked, those people could get away with not doing their job and it would be up to the ones that she didn't like to finish all of the work."
bad,It's hard to say anything good about a job when your manager can't even make it to work on time every day. Literally 15-30 minutes late EVERY SINGLE DAY
bad,"Very poor management, and discrimination... they want you to hide tattoos and i was told if i would have had my interview with this other guy, the general manager, he wouldn't of hired me because of my tattoos. Very disrespectful place and people at Casey's. Would NOT recommend."
bad,"bad management, not enough hours , too much drama. felt like i was in high school again. just not worth the time and effort to even go in half the timen"
bad,I've worked for caseys off and on for 20+ years its always a good back up job. Working for them this time has been awful the manager does not do her job at all. She expects employees to do their job but don't do hers the schedule also shouldn't even be wrote out it changes daily some times more than once a day. This manager can't keep people working for her she sucks poorly at working management one day you could work a mid day shift closing next day you could come in at 4:45 and work 4 hours some days 10.5 hours for $9.00 hour no thank you caseys with experience long shifts we deserve more than half off on food we consume and a free drink while on shift poor way to keep employee's
bad,Not very nice  rude and wasn’t a good manager at all was flexible with hours only paid vacation when your a full time employee which I didn’t like but I did enjoy my coworker
bad,"This company has no regard for worker safety. One Saturday in April last year, we had a big blizzard that was rolling through Minnesota. I and another person, who no longer works there, had the closing shift that night. All of the other businesses in the area, including the other gas stations, were closing up early due to the bad weather, but the company wouldn't let us do the same. According to what we were told, the severe weather wasn't a good enough reason to do so. Because of their stupidity, the snow was piled up so bad that my coworker and I couldn't even get into our cars, much less use them to get home, so we had to get rides from other people. If we hadn't been able to do that, there's a good chance we would've died. This company needs to be held accountable for such irresponsible behavior, especially the people who run it."
bad,"I have worked at 2 Casaey's, and the management has always been terrible. You either work what you are scheduled, regardless on if you have prior commitments such as another job, or you get fired. It doesn't matter if you work 8 hours or if you have a medical problem, there are no breaks, you aren't allowed to go to the bathroom. It is just a terrible company. And if you try to contact HR anonymously, they will tell everyone your name so you're boss will punish you."
bad,"Sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks.!!!!!"
bad,Great first job for a teenager but horrible if you want to work full time and advancement will never happen. Toxic work environment and high turn over rate.
bad,"The entire time that I was employed at Casey's, The manage always worked me. He would ignore issues that would affect me and then leave them for me to fix, even though I was never paid to deal with manager problems. We would always be understaffed on busy nights and I would always have to cover peoples shifts because people wouldn't show up to work and the manager wouldn't tell me about it. He would also frequently ignore my requests to not come to work on certain days."
bad,Either they work u to death or u are constantly begging for hours...Casey's will hire anyone moron into management as long as they are available 24/7...pay and benefits are terrible and they only know u as a number not a name...nobody is held accountable for anything...if u are considering employment with Casey's just keep looking
bad,Company not sympathetic to people who are sick...Made people work with fevers and strep throat. no hygiene protocol. Afraid to eat there and will probably not
bad,"Honestly the worst job I’ve ever had. The workload was way too high for overnight shift, and every night some new drama unfolded.  I just couldn’t keep going there"
bad,Really bad place to work hard on your body no help very tiring  u get nothing hall off they let other employees do nothing which is very frustrating I wouldn’t advise working there ty
bad,Caseys was a good place to work. I enjoyed the management and the coworkers --good place to work. No typical work day as many different duties involved
bad,Not a good place to work if you want a future. The pay is not enough for me. I did like taking care of the customer's. I was only part-time I need a full time job.
bad,My manager was a terrible person. She refused to adhere to when people could work. She didn't care about if you had another job or not. The only good thing about working there was the 50% food that they make.
bad,I have gotten the shaft since I've been there.  Was told I would be put on full-time but that never happened.  I have gotten reduced part-time hours and living paycheck to paycheck is difficult on such a low pay rate.
bad,i didnt get along with the other employees whom were lazy and talked about everyone behind there backs and management new and failed to take action against other emplyees because they were there favorites
bad,"I managed a small store in a very small town My supervisor was hateful & rude to everyone. She never gave compliments & constantly was over critical of every tiny thing & each employee. I was told to fire 2 long term employees so retirement would not have to be paid. I was written up several times because my store bonus was not as high as the bigger stores that were close. I left the company after working exactly 1 year, was not given my paid vacation & forced to work any & every missed shift because I was salary-making my weeks 80-90 hours long. Most days starting at 0300,  ending at1800. Working 7 days a week because I was not allowed to hire the amount of help needed to run the store during open hours. "
bad,Poor management. they are constantly changing your schedule without letting you know. if they do call you it is last minute. they have you go from cooler to rain and back constantlly
bad,Sucked the life out of me. Good for high schoolers or people in college but no career oppurtunity here unless your going to the right church!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"They were constantly understaffed, requiring the first and second assistant to fill in the positions.  All the management, with the exception of the actual store manager, are overworked and extremely underpaid for the jobs they preform."
bad,"Poor management personnel-"
bad,Of someone calls in and you have the day off you have to go in and work and the manger will also call one someone to come in so she don't have to work
bad,Ugh! This place does not care about their employees and they go back on what they say. The pay is way less than other places and they expect more without compensating for it.
bad,They have no sympathy or empathy. Insensitive to a person like me with a disability. Played mind games. Cut my hours. Fired me for things I had already told triggered me in my interview.
bad,"Poor poor mangmnt, low starting wages and raises. Weekends required. Drama filled workplace. Does not give a specified lunch break or in between breaks. Just a quick few minutes to have a smoke if you smoke. Lunch if eaten there is done in front of customers if you are cashier."
bad,"It is not all it is cracked up to be. False promises are made; management has ""pets"" and everyone likes to talk behind your back."
bad,"I would never recommend this job to anyone. The store was nasty, the management was horrible. I never got paid on time or as much as I should have been. My checks were always at least a week late and at least $100 short."
bad,It is a horrible company to work for the management there is very poor I was doing management duties and not getting the right pay for it nor did they want to accommodate or anything that I was doing
bad,I'm currently employed here and it's not a bad job. The only problem is the management. The current manager is awful. She has not respect for any of her employees and I'm looking for a job that's better with their employees.
bad,This place sucks to work management is awful everyone there fight with each other very hostile environment. Not for someone who can’t “hold there own”
bad,"I loved my job at caseys, and i would have loved to advance. But the management was very poor, And pushed all their good employees out the door. making donuts early in the morning was one of my favorite things to do. I got to know a lot of my customers and that was the best part of my day"
bad,Managers change your schedule with zero notification. Managers talk bad about employees to other employees.  No appreciation received for anything you do. Managers will not hire men. Favoritism is a big thing here.
bad,"Probably the worst place I have worked at for various reasons. Its not that I have outrageous expectations for my work environment but management could use a lot of work. If you have no life, no family, wish to live out of your car and expected to be an all star employees this is the perfect place for any potential job applicants. Don't get sick though. I've seen co-workers get written up for being too weak to work due to cancer, too soar due to kidney stones, doctors notes were given and ignored. Many of the people currently working there show up late all the time with no repercussion and you are expected to stay late for them even if it is outside of your availability. They are currently and indefinitely on a wage freeze, meaning no matter how great your work ethic you will never get a raise. "
bad,I never felt appreciated going into work at Casey’s. I would go in and put in my all and the managers would talk behind my back about how they wanted to get rid of me. I t just wasn’t a good environment for me to be working in being a single father.
bad,i didnt really like working here but it wasnt terrible i just didnt like the early mornings had to be there by 3am to make doughnuts and breakfast pizza
bad,"they are the most unfairly job ever worked for ,. the don't value their employees fairly and that the days are long and work is longer and they don't respect their employees well"
bad,"If you’re looking to apply here, you’d be better selling your body on the street. This place is horrible. I worked there for a few months and in that time, management chose favorites, management didn’t even do there jobs, I, as well as other employees who actually did Their jobs had to also do the jobs of the ones who didn’t do anything. If you did you’re job as well as other jobs, you got yelled at, and if you didn’t do your job, you got yelled at. Management gave Slack to the people who were horrible employees, but beat the breaks out of the ones who did there jobs. You were lucky to get a break. (And by lucky I mean you had to be a pet of the managers.) the worst employment opportunity you could imagine. DONT APPLY IF YOU VALUE YOURSELF AS A HUMAN BEING!"
bad,"I hated working at Caseys everyone acts like they are still in high school, unless you are friends with the store manager you got horrible hours, and they didnt treat me like I was a part of the team, very disrespectful!"
bad,Management will ignore all of your concerns and will only tell you what you are doing wrong. Pass on this place so you don't get stuck in their trap. Good luck.
bad,"Management within the company is very wishy washy, They say one thing and do another. company policies only pertain to employees not management. This includes corporate management. starting pay is very fair. but you will not get yearly raises and when or if you are promoted you get very minimum raise. pay difference from part-time employee to 1st assistant manager is only a dollar. you are givin minimum hours and expected to complete a whole days worth of work with the time frame, with lack of support."
bad,"This is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. The pay rating is not worth the work you are required to do. Their raises are annual and you get a set raise, not based on your performance or tenure with the company. They also messed up my check on several occasions and refused to fix it."
bad,Store employees spend more time outside smoking then they do taken care of customers.  Management sucks. Store morral isvery low. Cleaning in the kitchen isn't done.
bad,It was stressful you would work all hours of the day and management never appreciated it.  They keep the bad workers and get rid of the good ones.  This store has been through 11 managers in 2 years.  There is a reason for this.
bad,I liked working with the public and learning how to be a assistant manger and making pizzas.  I did not like the manager they brought in he was rude to customers and wanted his own people in the store he fired everyone that talked back to him
bad,"At first it was good but, as time started going on the managers all started to make it out for me to quit and they tried to find reasons to fire me because I put my child before them."
bad,"My job was great, it is a small town and I felt I help people everyday  but the store got new upper management  she  thought differently and constantly micro managed and had nothing but negative this to say when at the store"
bad,Worst company. Its like a high school you have to be in the click to matte...they talk about employees behind there backs then right the employees up.
bad,personally i would not recommend working for this company unless you are just a kid trying to make some extra money. It is not a job for advancement or long term possibilities for people living to take care of themselves and others.
bad,"Other employees were unreliable. Cleaning the grease trap was absolutely disgusting. You never knew how many hours to expect each week. The whole place is filled with no, but drama between employees and even upper management."
bad,Had a bad experience with Casey's in college don't ever plan on going back poor management and the pay sucked but hey that was like three years ago so who knows now
bad,"I didnt like working there. I had to work in the deli and i did not apply for that position. I applied for a cashiering position. I had to work every weekend and help in the kitchen as well as making sub sandwiches,pinwheels, make the bread, buns for hotdogs and hamburgers, etc"
bad,"The management here is terrible. Just awful. They're the kind of people that don't want To solve problems, but make them worse. They treat good employees like garbage and let the terrible lazy workers get away with everything. Management has NO idea what they are doing whatsoever."
bad,"The store on 28th and J in Bentonville  is the worst store ever, The manager plays her employees against each other...Always drama. Kitchen worker drinks outback and dayworkers are drug users."
bad,It sucks they only will give you hours if you suck up to the store manager or are young and cute. They don't care about the workers and think the employees are dumbfounded
bad,"Lack of management. Favors were always chosen. You could only work the morning shift if you were 3 certain people working in that store. Management did NOTHING about the drama and rumors being spread throughout the store. If you are a manager, you need to act like one and set a good example for your employees. I worked full time, however, it was not 40 hours a week. It could be just 34 hours per week, and being paid bi-weekly that does not help. Overall, was not a good working environment and management allowed knowing the knowledge of certain co workers being under the influence of drugs to continue working and there was no consequences for their actions. The place was a zoo and management did nothing about it. Casey's by far is the most stressful atmosphere I have ever worked at in my entire life. I am very happy to have found a  much better job and moved on with my life."
bad,never ever again. That's really all i have to say the job was tiresome long boring the only thing that even remotely made the job worth having was the customers. I mean I know not all of them are bad just never experience working for the good ones.
bad,They worked me for 38 hours one week then the next week only 7 hours.. My co workers are gossiping and not doing anything while I do rush hour by myself. Then they wonder why they don't keep anyone. They is discrimination and harassment. A co worker curse me out in front of customers for something I didn't do.
bad,"it was very unpleasant management did not do there job place was not really that clean and the management had lack of communication ,nobody there would have a set schedule they would just pencil it in and no calls no shows were problems but no written warnings were given to the certain individual,nothing was organized,as well as understocked with supplies.management was very poor  at keeping a schedule and communicating with employees."
bad,"This is a horrible place to work, you don't get any type of break unless you get time to take it yourself, they work you too hard for too little money and are always rude no matter who you work with"
bad,Horrible place to work do not ever work there it is all drama worst place to ever work its like high school again with all stuck up people that dont want to do there job
bad,I will not work for them again.  I was let go for unfair reason.  Worked ridiculous hours for very little pay. They are unfair to their employees.  And the store is not kept well but the manager
bad,Lots of times on my days off they would call me to come in on my days OFF. If I didn't answer they would show up at my house. One time they even showed up at my mom's work looking for me. That's the main reason I quit.
bad,This was my first job so it had gotten me prepared for what the work place offered . I had come out of my shyness working with customers  becoming more sociable
bad,"No support from upper management.  Would instruct you on a task and once it was completed reprimand you for doing what they requested you to do.  Perfect attendance but went had to use FMLA was replaced the day it ran out, even though still under the care of a doctor.  Upper management sets you up for failure!  No matter how bad you need a job, would not recommend working for them to anyone!!"
bad,"They do not care about their employees at all, they will change your schedule without notifying you and then say you didn't show up for work. They won't give you enough hours to get benefits or survive, they have be some of the worst management I have ever seen."
bad,It would have been a great place to work if they would have had the right people running the store. There was just so much confusion within the store and it may it hard for us to concentrate on our job.
bad,"management was unorganized unprepared two-faced and rude. she filled employees heads with empty promises and spread lies about people. and wrongfully terminating a great employee, again because of lies."
bad,This company underpays and overworks all of their employees. Upper management is very rude to employees. I would not recommend any one I know and like to work for Casey General Stores.
bad,"Was so disappointed by management and over all administration.  Poor work condintions, poor management, lack of good wages to draw good workers.  No perks or benefits."
bad,"The job was horrible."
bad,"management was bad, pay was bad, hours were bad, schedule was everywhere, was left there for almsot 3 shifts as the person didn't call and didnt show up and management wouldnt answer their phones."
bad,"I would recommend this place to a friend, they are very friendly and help out when needed, some of the managers were not so friendly when I was employed there but the overall experience was good"
bad,"It doesn't matter how much of a good worker you are, if you have 1 bad day, you are officially an enemy of management. But all gas stations are pretty much like this."
bad,"I was constantly over scheduled, some days i would be required to work from 3-12 and then be scheduled to come right back in a 6 in the morning, the management hardly ever got anything fixed because it effected her yearly bonus. the kitchen in casey's was disgusting the store had mice in it. We were not even given breaks and stretched very thin hardly ever given assistance. the list really goes on and on. While i was working there one employee constantly sexually harassed another and the manager did absolutely nothing about it."
bad,Not organized. Will fire you for no reason at all. Management does whatever they want..Does not follow schedule times and gives our personal info over phone.
bad,If I would of had a supiviser that did her part I could of done a better job. Had great staff. Just didn't have upper management help. CEO or no one in corporate never showed up to store.
bad,Not very good job.  Low pay no benefits or payoff days off.  Machines always out of order or in need or repairs. Strict 8.50 an hour with no advance mental.
bad,Probably one of the toughest jobs I've ever had. I have the up most respect for anyone that works on a the convenient store business. The way customers treat the workers at convenience stores is mind boggling.
bad,"Management is horrid, the pay is next to nothing compared to their competitors. Dirty stores. Need to give advancements to people who deserve it. Over all worst place for management."
bad,No one knew what was going on at any time. Ever. People would call in and managers would not answer their phone resulting in the person on shift having to stay over time.
bad,"This employer doesn't appreciate it's hard working employees and allows other employees to loaf, take excessive smoke breaks for excessive times without allowing non-smoking employees a break, and use cell phones in front of customers. Employees that are unwilling to correctly do the job are advanced and praised while employees who work hard and deserve advancement are treated like slaves and as incompetent."
bad,"Management was chaotic and unknowing of their employees. The schedule was consistent but few employees showed up on time and called in frequently causing myself and others to take doubles, stay late or come in early, or pick up extra shifts on our days off. Managers and employees alike quit and walked out in the middle of shifts. It was honestly like working on a drama television show. My training was poor, there was bad mouthing amongst the staff incisively, and if you were knew you did everything while the people who were supposed to be training you sat on their phones."
bad,"they let people who are late get away with things and will move them up in the company and yell at you,  they expect alot out of you but nothing in return.  they want you to take up extra hours but not give you days off,"
bad,"The management needs to quit playing favorites."
bad,"they employees were not so nice, they didn't give very many hours work a wk and they pay was not good for what they expected you to do. I did not enjoy this job."
bad,They don't drug test. It is great that they hire anyone but the fact that they don't test is a problem. They know if they did test that their workforce would become a tenth of what it is.
bad,3 hours a week. would you continue to work at a place that gave you three hours a week? your coworkers where stealing and alcoholics and they got more hours than you.
bad,To many employees taking advantage of a boss that couldn't stand up for herself. No hours poor work relations. Everyone trying to get new people in trouble.
bad,I did not get a chance to work there because I had to move from where the store was located and the management is poor because I felt like I was being harassed and discriminated.
bad,"i worked for thi s company in west desmoines store location.. i worked very hard and was always great with customers and efficient. I was dependable and very hard working if not over achiever .. and this was never acknowledged.. very lazy management staff and corportate was of no help with this."
bad,"The manager at this location is very rude and absolutely impossible to work with."
bad,Not the best place to work they hire felons an drug users an doesnt drug test i was very disappointed with the work ethics there sobi quiet. The had bad food an would not change bread or change old food with new. I got into trouble for trying to throw week old meats an othet things out saying that i was wasting food .i will not work for this company again nor do i like to shop there.
bad,They would not schedule enough employees for their shifts and then would get mad when we could not get everything done on time. They didn't enforce their schedule.
bad,Working here you feel like your working all the time but your making next to nothing defiantly not worth the pay. You feel you work all the time or not enough but either way your making dirt money
bad,Unless you want to dead end your career I would advise to never work for Casey's. Bad Bad Bad place to work! Management is a joke and make their living off the hard working efforts of lower level employees. Weekly meetings on how to make employees work harder for less is commonplace. Corporate levels are a joke and do not look out for the lower levels of employees.
bad,the employers was showing discrimination towards me and they were treating me unfairly. the management was horrible the maniger were always being mean to me
bad,"Too early in the morning "
bad,The management needs to be trained better due to poor customer service skills. As for the workers they need more training and some of them need to be seriously fired due to not following proper policies when it comes to kitchen and food prep.
bad,To many people making bad decisions and not enough communication. There needs to be more people that are willing to do better at there job and taking a skills class
bad,Everyone walked out and I was stuck trying to cover 3 shifts. You work long hours and management is a hassle. Good luck if you are applying for an entry level job.
bad,"Upper management was very rude and disrespectful, if you had a problem and you couldn't get it resolved with store manager and you tried to go speak with them, they would always take store manager side even though they were in the wrong sometimes"
bad,"Caseys general store has no regard for the safety or well being of their employees, a coworker suffered from seizures and instead of having medics called for her she was made to stay untill a replacement could take her place, i was regularly scheduled for 3:00pm-12:00am and then i would have to return to work at 6:30AM-3:00pm and given absolutely no assistance on the days that were very busy and harassed by other employees for leaving the kitchen during slow points and never given my state mandated breaks.I was also given tasks that had nothing to do with my job."
bad,"Chaos, hectic, and unprepared no one worked together well, and no one did there job to a standard that should be top notch stressful and not willing to work at the same location ever again."
bad,"underpaid, understaffed, made over one hundred pizzas on Friday and Saturday nights from scratch, had to answer and take phone orders, on line orders and delivery orders, cleaned work areas and floor, restocked ingredients for pizza. Made pizza dough."
bad,This job is not worth working for. This company is backwards. The manager is rude and will not work with you on anything that is going on. He will go out of his way to make you feel bad.
bad,I would review this place as the worst of all places to work at. Management doesn't know what she is doing. treats co-workers like dirt especially me. she favoritizes the people she wants to. the most enjoyable part of the job was the sub side.
bad,"While I was sweeping the floors I had hurt my hand. The supervisor never asked me what happened, how was I feeling and never ever did they say go to the doctor. "
bad,Management was never really there so we had a problem we tactor wait but other than that it was an OK place to work. A lot of drama inside and outside the work place
bad,"Company's contract was bought out and they laid off everyone working. Was a decent company to work for, but management ran it into the ground."
bad,this place is a joke to work for i do not suggest anyone to work for these fools as they will forcefully terminate without your knowledge
bad,i worked 3rd which was 11pm-7am i hated it because i couldnt spend alot of time with my wife. i couldnt make plans because i always had to work. then they kept hiring people so my hours were cut way back so i had to find another job
bad,"when i started they had other people who had been there for 4 years and has no idea what they were doing. inventory was almost never correct, we always ran out of product, i was put in head of kitchen on my 3rd day simply because noo one knew what they were doing and the scheduled times i told them i could not work were not honored."
bad,"this job would be a good one to  have if you are in high school or retired, but if you do not fall into either of those than it is not a good job to have as it does not pay very good at all, and not a lot of opportunities to advance positions."
bad,"The Casey's where I was located is an absolute disgrace to this company.  Management was poor, the store was never cleaned the way it was supposed to be.  The workers who completed their jobs correctly and on time are treated very poorly, while those who barely do what they're supposed to get pampered and praised."
bad,They work you to the bone. If you do not believe in their views you get targeted. They will not work with your schedule even if you have kids or school.
bad,it's a small company in a small town so the customers are easy to remember and super nice gettin to know ur coworkers is easy and fun
bad,"typical day at this job was cleaning bathrooms, windows mopping floors,swepping, horrible evironment to work bad attitudes, manager has a horrible attitude."
bad,"I worked for this company for awhile. I would go above and beyond for them and all they care about is money. I only got a quarter raise while working and I was a part of the management team. The manager at my store in was a real piece of work. She would sit on her butt on her phone all day long, only get up to flirt with male customers. Pathetic. They changed the starting wage to 9.00 a hour and that's what I was making and did not get a raise. They told me I was no better then a normal employee I just gave the manager a break when I did books every other weekend. I was not important and that came from the district manager."
bad,"Casey's was my first job I ever held down, besides little summer jobs helping clean out houses and mow lawns. I was 18, living in a small town farm community, and I can tell you right now I learned a lot from working their. I learned how to communicate in a work place, customer service skills, and the means and drive to push myself higher in life."
bad,"Money was taken out of my drawer on several occasions, records were falsified by management claiming that I had drawer shortages when others were responsible for the shortage.  I do not know how the drawers were short as I counted back change three times per transaction.  It is possible that I had one or two shortages of a few dollars here and there but a repeated pattern of shortages was blamed on me over the amount of 10 dollars.  And I am positive that those shortages were not accurate.  I suspect a corrupt person may have been employed by the company but cannot prove that only examination of records can.  If a pattern is identified than it is likely corruption was present.  Other employees reported the same types of discrimination who worked there during that time period. Schedule availability not followed. Was forced to work at times I specii"
bad,"Always picking up extra shifts, finishing others jobs and little pay. Coworkers are very caddy and untrustworthy. Make you work all the different shifts and benefits weren't great."
bad,"a typcal day at work would be doing daily deposits and taking to bank making sure store is clean and looking good, making prep in kitchen and making sure it is clean and product looks good."
bad,"Needed employees"
bad,"This company did little for enhancing my skills, however did allow the opportunity to gain great managment skills."
bad,Typical work day consists of 16hrs. avg.  Had a salaried management position paid for 45 hrs/wk & consistantly worked 80 +.
bad,It was a good place to work but they werent hiring fulltime employees
bad,I did not really enjoy this type of job so my review will be more negative. However telemarketing is not for everyone.
bad,"A typical day at work involved being belittled by upper management. Being expected to do others jobs on top of your own and then being blamed for their jobs not being done correctly."
bad,Worked for very ill management.  I've worked in retail a few times and this was the worst work environment ever.
bad,"It is a pretty rotten place. No one cares about doing what they are supposed to do, and management does not care to punish those who break the rules. Almost every employee leaves things for the next shift just because they do not want to do it themselves. I would not work here if I didn't ABSOLUTELY need the money."
bad,i didnt like it they would work you to the teeth and then have the nerve to call you in and seems like the manager did know how to run the store
bad,"Horrible hours, terrible pay for working you like a dog, very small pitiful raises after a year of service, no recourse if you have a disagreement with a staff member, not even a place to sit down for even five minutes unless you wanted to sit on an icing bucket in the kitchen, if you got hurt on the job they didn't want to make out an accident report"
bad,bad management! never lets their employees have a say! horrible! dont work there at all enless you like being bossed around by an 80 year old woman who has over stayed her welcome being the boss!
bad,"liked co-workers, learned to make donuts,making pizzas and donuts."
bad,I was a cashier at Caseys I liked to visit with the customers but everything else was not fun. I was the onle one who stocked the cooler. We had several manager changes. People that worked there gossiped.
bad,"This corporation undervalues thier employees and does not give them the tools to succeed.  From day one employees are told, 'don't do this, you will be written up,  don't do that, you will be written up. Write up, write up, write up.""  No encouragement whatsoever from upper management.. I feel this was the worst company I have ever worked for as far as how they treated thier employees  and for their benefits.  Co-workers are great but get burned out quickly after seeing how upper management treats them.  "
bad,"Management enjoys drama more so than running a business and would rather engage in immoral and counterproductive backstabbing than helping their employees advance so that the company may advance as a whole. Strange, hostile work environment that seems to be present at every Casey's store location. Managers and upper management do way too much yelling and don't understand that this is very counterproductive. Also, abstract work schedule makes family life non-existent. Working here is only beneficial for singles without children and teenagers...and I use the term, 'beneficial' loosely..."
bad,"The management for caseys is horrible! When I was training with my boss she would yell at me in front of the customers. She would call me at home to come in on my days off. If I told her I had appointments or plans, she would ask what I had to do & would become very angry. If you were on her bad side she would take you off days and make you work every weekend. One morning when I came into work she said the person that worked the pervious night did not clean the bathroom well enough. She was yelling and screaming in the store at me. When I told her that there was no reason to be rude to me when I didnt work last night, she told me I could just go home. When I finally found another job, I put my two weeks in & she wouldn't let me finish my last week of work, she said that I was not needed. When I bought this to my boss's boss attention, she only insisted I transfer to another store. Worst place I have ever worked."
bad,"count the cig and lottery + total food what was made and wasted totals on company spread sheet. great place with a busy gas station, pre pay. balance the cash drawers. made pizzas to order til 10 p.m."
bad,"you have to pay close attention to the pumps for drive-offs because they do not have cameras and you get wrote up for drive-offs while taking care of customers, stocking, cleaning, facing shelves, sweep and buff the floor nightly."
bad,fun when you work with the right people. only two people care about the customers there. most of the employees and managers are rude
bad,I ran the register. I dealt with customers. I don't know what else to tell you.
bad,My review was it was a good starter job because I just moved out here. It was good to meet the people around the neibhiorhood and get to know thwm on a personal level
bad,Casey's General Stores fails to meet the needs of good employees thus the organiztion has a high turnover rate. Store management is treated indifferently by district supervisors who fail to realize that the employees in each store is the reason that the company profits. General managers are treated with no regard and terminated on a regular basis.
bad,not a good place to work
bad,"This is a convenience store. The mangement is very poor, with incomplete personell policies and an unstructured corporation."
bad,"When working for Casey's the Manager had no experience. She offered no motivation or experience to her staff. Staff was more trained than she was during her time there. She ignored company policies and procedures, and brought her personal life to work everyday. If you were not her friend or disagreed with her, your hours were cut until you quit. Corporate management ignored all staff complaints, even after investigation by the area supervisor."
bad,I was a manager making less then $10/hour  not worth it..... if you don’t have a family or bills maybe this is the right place for you  but if you have kids or bills  don’t bother
bad,"I walked out and did not call back because of how terrible Casey's was a place to work."
bad,Casey's was a fun and great place to work.  Once they brought in new managers and district managers the entire atmosphere and place changed for the worse. These people were rude and looked down on all of us. We were treated horrible and made yo feel we were not worth anything.  Casey's would be great if they did something with the upper management that think they are God's gift to the world
bad,This job is not what they make it out to be. Management is not on point and rarely will you get the days off that you are supposed to. I would never work for caseys again.
bad,"Lack of ownership with Area supervisors and District manager. They act like the rules don’t apply to them. They enjoy making employees feel like they are small and easily replaceable. They make you work in other stores even when you’re store does not have enough staff to accommodate its own business needs. "
bad,The managment was horrible. They changed schedules around on me without informing me. Manager would not tell me how to get my  paystubs. The people that were doing the same job as me were alright. It was the management that was doing things wrong.
bad,"Had an allergic reaction at work and had to go to ER, other employees complained that I got special treatment because of my food allergies. One employee thought it was funny by putting stuff in my drink that I was allergic to."
bad,managers dont know how to do their jobs and treat employees poorly. ignored requests to work different shifts and were not able to order what we needed for the store. we were constantly out of something .
bad,"Wasn’t a bad place to work, but management could not schedule properly. You end up working on your days off, and pulling double shifts all the time. Absolutely no benefits as they like to keep everyone at “part time”. Also, the type of people they hire are a problem... basically anyone that walks in off the street."
bad,"manager promises one shift and gives you another, very un professional all the way up to the district manager. co workers dont do their job and managemesnt does nothing to fix the issue"
bad,Management at almost all Caseys don't care about the employees. They want you to work yourself to an early grave but don't appreciate you. There's always someone else ready to take your job if you're not half dead a quitting time. Is what they think.
bad,"Terrible management, terrible hours, terrible pay.  There are 0 incentives to work at Caseys, they do not value you.  You even have to pay to eat a slice of pizza you’d probably throw away anyway.  Every time I walk into a caseys now, all I do is feel bad for the employees that work there.  Not to mention you have to deal with meth tweakers near 10-11.  DO NOT GET A JOB HERE!"
bad,The store manager treats her employees like dogs and is always in a bad mood and is easy to set off over the littlest of things. Not to forget she changes the schedule and never tells anyone.
bad,"There is no describing how disgusting this place is. I was in the nicest store, but any other you went to looks like it was built in an old repurposed septic tank. And the flies, dear god the flies. The only pest control they allow is a purple light stuck to the wall, and the flies could just buzz in and out with no ill effects."
bad,Management  is horrible  and cheats books to steal come company. They don't care of u have a day off ever and when you have had enough of being cussed out by supervisor and u leave then they run there mouths all over town. There are 3 Casey's in my town none of them follow the policy of Casey's company
bad,"I started working at Casey's 1.5 years ago and wish I had never gotten the job. Management has no formal training and frequently degrades employees in front of other employees and customers. Emotional and physical abuse is commonly practiced by management. One of the 4 mottos is professional. It is not professional to stand in the store in front of customers & fellow employees screaming at an employee. If an employee is not part of the favored team they are often subjected to humiliating screaming scenes.    Casey's does not practice what they preach. I would not recommend that a young employee or first-time employee ever work for this company. Discrimination is also a common practice at Casey's. The manager has been heard to say they dislike hiring older people as it is not worth her time to train them, but they have to meet government guidelines."
bad,"Very little to no training. Asked Manager for more, but was never scheduled. Always got in trouble for things I didn't know I was supposed to do because lack of training. Issues were never resolved. Scheduling was always an issue. Store managers are VERY VINDICTIVE AND RETALIATORY. If you bring up legit concerns, they say you are a trouble-maker and you're stirring the pot. The procedure for conflict resolution and chain of command is broken."
bad,"Too much work for one person per shift in a kitchen that has a full sub line, handmade pizzas and a variety of other food.   Lack of teamwork, not enough employees, they expect you to work around food when you’re sick."
bad,I loved my job. I did not care for the people I worked for. They were  not helpful when asked questions about things you didnt understand because you weren't trained properly. This job should have never been that stressful.
bad,From management to the gm to the wearhouse where do I start unorganized! No communication Skills lack of respect for their employees and their employees home life Short breaks just enough time to go to the bathroom and then help another customer
bad,The management was full of toxic people and the hours were too inconsistent. The managers held deep favoritism for some workers and it showed in the schedule book
bad,"The company doesn't care about the employees, they would prefer to eliminate dedicated employees by any means necessary to save money and sacrifice quality. They don't expect you to have a life outside of work. They demand too much for the pay."
bad,"I'm never working at this corporate ever again. It's nothing but corporate slavery, and they really don't care about the employees. They don't believe in helping anyone but themselves to get rich. No holiday pay unless you work the holidays, no paid time off. They expect more than what they deserve."
bad,"First job, was not impressed at all.. Management was strict, but never wanted to actually help. You were told where to go and that was it, youre on your own."
bad,"It's a perfect job for teenagers who need a job, but wouldn't recommend for someone searching for a career. Ironically, you'll be stuck if you continue to work for a company with a high turnover rate."
bad,go in and change to there work shirts that cant leave the store. count the drawer to start as customers are trying to check out and making them wait. do normal transactions most of the shift. hope the next employee shows up to release you.
bad,"This company could care less about its employees and how they are treated. Hard work is frowned upon and the pay is minimum. Very gender specific, men don't have a chance here, aimed towards promoting women more than men."
bad,"If you're really close to missing bills or need a job fast then Casey's is a job that will provide for you. Yet their scheduling process is unreliable, and changes all the time. You get one day off a week if they're short handed, and if you do get two days off scheduled more often then not you'll be called in. My particular manager changed the schedule an HOUR after I LEFT, and never bothered to call me to let me know it was changed and had moved my day off later in the week leaving me with a nice phone call at 3 in the morning."
bad,This job is stressful poor management people always late never a set schedule some people you work with can be kind and polite buut a lot will walk around like their your boss
bad,"That particular store had a lot of issues that could have been prevented if the management paid any attention. Poor training for the job. As well as many drawer shortages from poor training. Staff was like middle school situations, no reason for not getting along, was always about favorites. No team work what so ever."
bad,"I worked my tail end off and never got recognition for it but taken advantage of. Some of the customers are rude as well but you just have to deal with that"
bad,its a good job but your stressed out more then you should be. plus your being underpaid for overnights to deal with what you need to deal with. your always bored just trying to find something to do thats been done over and over. their lists make no sense and their management is poor. schedules are never out on time and the manager always comes up with an excuse on why the schedule isnt out.
bad,Slow work pace but the customers were good.I have learned how to deal with people even when they are having a bad day and are not so nice. Management was lazy.
bad,"Non stop slow paced for about first four hours of the shift. Poor management. If one overnight person calls in or gets sick and calls in. We get attitude for an entire day. I was called in one night on my night off as if I HAD to go in. In all reality the manager didn't want to come in and do her ""management duties"""
bad,Degrading comments made often and nothing was ever done after repeatedly spoke with supervisor. Wenter through it for almost two months before my boyfriend finally decided he wasn't going to have me spoken to that way.
bad,Very poor management and inappropriate environment. Do not treat employees with equal respect and do not consider their interests. Employees are unhappy and reflects on customers.
bad,"typically come in to clean after the previous shift. Mopping, sweeping indoors and parking lot, laundry, trash inside and outside, restocking products; cigs, groceries, drinks. I learned if you are hoping for a dead end job with absolutely no chance for promotion, or gratitude for working hard and want a dead end job this is for you!!! Most coworkers were cool of course there are exceptions. Easiest job in the world. Quitting time was the only time I was not miserable."
bad,I would arrive at work and take care of my customers first. I learned that not everybody had the same idea as me. Management is extremely poor there. I enjoyed working with my co-workers as well as they did me. I didn't like being reminded daily of what my duties while the afternoon shift would come in with no supervision and do what they wanted to do. I truly enjoyed servicing the customers.
bad,"I was head cashier and also tried to do cleaning, facing of shelves and stocking.  I learned how convenience store runs.  Management in these stores can be overwhelmed by the turnover in employees.  The hardest part of this job was an irregular schedule.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the public."
bad,I was to sick and they fired me  3 days after that I found out I was pregnant. The employees didn't know what team work was Always leave stuff for the next person to have to do
bad,Come in and management starts telling you what all needs changed and what your doing wrong I would not recommend working at caseys
bad,"I loved working with everybody while I worked at Casey's but the primary manager would refuse to give me 1 or 2 of my checks, and even after quitting I received neither. Assistant manager came in drank, high, or not at all, forcing other people to stay late."
bad,Staff was not open to hiring new people. When i was first hired all the other employees were rude and talked about each other behind their backs. Management did nothing about this. Certain employees were treated like management and given way too much power. Cleanliness was terrible and some cooks would touch food without washing hands or wearing gloves.
bad,"Management never had schedule done on time so a person was not able to schedule their day."
bad,"Management was less than subpar, unreasonable. "
bad,this place is absolutely horrible. the area manager lady was the most difficult person to deal with. i would absolutely not ever work for this company again
bad,"Workers were uncoordinated."
bad,Caseys isnt a good place to work..the management in this store is not good. Favortisim goes on in this store..So I am looking to work from home so I can be there for my mom and grandchildren.
bad,worked to get things accomplished on a daily basis. I learned what management was about. Loved working with most of the co-workers. Getting very few days off. Working with the public and knowing they were satisfied with their servie.
bad,"I would never work for this company again, they don't trust their employees at all. they have cameras in every room. There views and management are terrible"
bad,Casey's is a good place to work for a high school student or college student looking for that first time job. Helps learn responsibility to be a team player.
bad,no matter how far and above you go while an employee at caseys you never get any acknowledgment for it.    corporate does not follow through with any of their promises.
bad,"When i started it was ok. It wasn't to bad. People were nice to me they were helpful. Then after about a month if being there things started going down hill. My paychecks weren't as much as they were when I was getting trained, hours werent great store manager she talked bad about a lot of the workers to other employees and management could've been way better."
bad,"Although the corporation has very good ethics, and the attempts at overhauling the systems are meant well, I highly advise against working for this company if you have a family or busy life. Management, in my opinion, is lacking competence and empathy for their crew. Taking proper channels and following proper policies and procedures gets you no where, and their lack of help makes in store issues almost impossible to fix."
bad,"I worked at Casey's for a little more than two years.  This place is as unorganized as they come.  Management wants to have a huge bonus for Christmas, so they cut the regular employee hours to the point where you have no help.  I worked in the kitchen, which requires a lot of work.  They would expect you to keep all of the warmers full with sandwiches and  pizzas, keep the donut case full at all times, and have another display full with ready-to-go sandwiches and other items, but they expected one person to do this.  In addition to this, you had pizza orders and customers that came up and asked for a sub sandwich or something else.  There was always expired food on the sub bar, and the other employees would not fill anything up or pull something out of the freezer for the next shift.  It was a true nightmare, and I stayed and put up with this mess for a long time until I couldn't stand it anymore.  "
bad,They treat you terribly. The managers talk down to you and treat you like you are an idiot. They do not train you properly and they make it seem like it is your fault.
bad,"incompetent Upper Management, Equipment that never sees repairs, You never know what you're working or if youre going to be fired the next day. Would NOT Recommend working for Casey's at all."
bad,It's a terrible job they don't care about you only themselves and if you mess up even on your first day they get mad and try to get you to quit cause they don't want to help you
bad,I worked for the company for 3 years. Got into a scheduling dispute with the manager and was fired the next day. You ask three different people the same question-no one will answer the same as far as their procedures go.
bad,"Poor management and lack of employees. Nobody wants to stay because manager stinks at the job. ""Rules"" are constantly changing."
bad,"Casey's General Stores is all about the money. The management has little to no empathy when employees are ill and in fact, require employees to work in kitchen areas and with the public while they have contagious illnesses and are told they are required to work because no one can cover their shifts and management wont."
bad,Departments in corporate office are silo'd.  One day you are your manager's star employee and the next day you're treated like dirt with no explanation.  The whole department walked on eggshells around the manager because you didn't know what type of mood she was in.  Very toxic environment.  Wouldn't wish my worst enemy to work there.
bad,"At all the stores I've worked at they do not abide by Illinois State laws on breaks or scheduling. There is no permanent shifts. You will be asked to work until sometime between 4p.m. and 11p.m. for a shift for one day and be expected to be back at work between 2a.m. and 4a.m. to start your shift. They keep the employees just under state full time hours so they can avoid paying unemployment if they do find a reason to fire you and employees have been fired for forgetting to pay for a 53 cent doughnut. The soda machines have mold growing in them, the doughnut case has fruit flies breeding in it, the kitchen manager at the Wynett store doesn't wear gloves when preping food and he is very condesending. the doughnut robot hasn't been cleaned in 3 months and the prep table ingredients are unknown as to how old they are due to management not wanting the bins labeled.  There is no management available on weekends and the regular employees are left to run the store alone..."
bad,"The Management at Casey's was horrible, and the are no regulations. Employees would leave during work hours with no repercussions. On several occasions, employees would stand behind the registers on their phones, eat, and curse.  Management knew about the issues and never acted on punishments.  The employees basically could do whatever  they wanted to, even in the presence of the store manager.  The Casey's located on Parid Rd, Rangeline Rd, Clark Lane as well as the El Chaparral locations are all the same. The kitchens are not cleaned regularly.  The Rangeline Casey's has roaches, there are dirty dough buckets stacked by the sinks for days, food was left to expire but still used to make pizzas and other foods served there.  The customer service is terrible in the kitchen.  The kitchen workers would often argue openly with management about ""not being rushed"" and would curse and argue with customers.  The store manager would regularly offer $20 worth of free merchandise to customers if orders were prepared late.  Kitchen workers were not prompt in changing their gloves or washing their hands.  Often the pizza cook would be so sweaty that pizzas would be contaminated with said sweat and still be served to customers.  The District Manager was made aware of the many of these situations and would not confront anyone in the store about their behaviors or hygiene.  While working there, I called the corporate office dozens of times to alert the company of all of the issues.  The cooler is hardly ever stocked according to company standards and when it is ""filled"", stuff is just thrown"
bad,This position was very stressful and generally unfulfilling in terms of personal satisfaction.  Management is very unprofessional and sometimes bluntly rude.
bad,Corporate management was severely lacking. Serious issues never received any solutions. For their business or for their work environment for their employees.
bad,They do not know how to treat people very well. I worked there a long time then getting a raise good luck on that one. Once you start making more money they try and set you up for failure then they fire you or cut your hours till you quit.
bad,"Management was horrible. They would expect us to do several different jobs during the busiest of hours. When you have a choice between your manager yelling at you about not getting everything done on your shift, or customers yelling at you for not tending to them, personally I chose to help the customer. The Manager was not too pleased. I would not recommend working here unless you need experience for a stressful job or there's nothing else currently available."
bad,"Overall, I did not intend to leave Casey's until just a few days ago. My coworkers are great, and I will genuinely miss some of my regular customers. However, my manager is the absolute worst. She doesn't seem to know what she's doing at all.  She also WILDLY favors the day shift workers, who all have set schedules (no one else does). This manager seems to think that the night shift workers are the laziest, most incompetent people on earth. When in reality, night shift comes in around 3 pm, and immediately has to start cleaning up after the day shift workers. She schedules 4 people to be there during the day, but only 2 during the night, and then doesn't make the day time workers do anything. She comes in at night to 'check in' on us, and SCREAMS at us when something hasn't been done yet. Mind you, we have 2 people doing the workload of 4, and we have until midnight to fully have everything done. DO NOT WORK HERE. No matter how hard I work, my manager ignores the facts and HATES night shift, therefore nothing will ever be good enough. It is seriously BORDERLINE ABUSIVE with how our manager talks to us. She made one of my coworkers actually CRY because of how hateful she is toward the night staff. The upper management is fully aware of  her behavior, and does NOTHING to stop it."
bad,"The work isn't bad.  Typical C-Store stuff.  Local store management is great.  The problem comes from above..."
bad,"Upon being hired I thought the manager was looking to improve the work culture and set an example for other stores in the area, however this wasn’t the case at all. After several months of dealing with lazy coworkers, a manager who I never saw, wasteful tendencies, and a neglectful human resource department I realized there was no desire from anyone to make improvements. I would not recommend working for this company to anyone."
bad,The manger hated me because who I was with very bias no longer the manger I did enjoy cooking somedays but never being trained made it very difficult.
bad,"Managers Changed often and middle management appointed their friends to roles of manager, even if they were not as qualified as another person for the job."
bad,"I know it depends on the store and manager but I dont suggest amyone to work for them. They cut their hours back so much to where the store can hardly be ran. Most full time employees can't even get their full time hours in. The way they do vacation sucks. From the time you go full time or get promoted you have to wait until that anniversary date to get your vacation/sick time benefits. They expect 1 person (the sub/lunch person) to finish breakfast, do subs, lunch, prep, make pizzas and subs for customers and keep up with a clean kitchen in a timly manor while only getting paid $9 an hour."
bad,"Its an ok place to work if you do not have any real responsilitiy, but the amount of hours you have to put in to make it worht the pay check is unGodly. And thats on top of bad management, unreliable co-wrkers, and rude customers."
bad,"there is usually only one employee per position each shift even when its busy. no benefits whatsoever, inappropriate work environment, constantly losing employees"
bad,"My whole town isn't fond of cases and neither am I. Why would I be? most of the people were rude and I felt to be judgmental. It was an uncomfortable workplace that left me tired, frustrated, and sick."
bad,I would not recommend this employer unless there were no other choice.  They have unreasonable expectations of what can be achieved by one person and have no plans for providing any work/life balance for its employees.
bad,Serve customers and help them to have best experience in store. My customers were the best part of job. The hardest part was no comment from management to employees or store
bad,"it was like working in a middle school. couldnt count on anything being correct. always something going wrong. hour horrible, pay was very little, but like every job it did have its fun moments."
bad,"At Casey's there was no teamwork whatsoever. Everyone did the minimal amount of work. The manager played favorites and they got to work First Shift. They were not flexible on days off that were requested. No one had a sense of urgency, the fellow employees were hardly there when they were scheduled."
bad,I was a first assistant manager. I was working 80 plus hours a week. Anytime someone called in I had to cover.  I would work 20 hour shifts weekly.  I received no help from upper management.  Was the most stressful job I have had in my career.  I would not recommend Casey's as a career to anyone.
bad,Liked the customers and had a good relation with them. Customers were loyal and came in everyday. I was getting to know them by their first names but more for personality and what they purchased everyday like brand of cigarettes and how many packs they wanted.
bad,"Was hired as assistant manager, store manager was a joke, will smile and be your best friend until you turn your back. Management gossip is unbelievable, immature.  Shame really... It's such nice store."
bad,This was a job that was completely unable to work around your life. the company itself is unorganized and unprepared. They say one thing and do another
bad,Casey's management and staff do not stand behind their employees when incidents arise...in a rough part of town and had to deal with alot of crime and drug use by customers and fellow employees...not a good place to work!
bad,"just not a good work environment"
bad,Terrible place to work. Employees were routinely set up to fail by the company's policies. Hours were odd (11 hr shifts) for cashiers and supervisors ignored all employee suggestions.
bad,The co workers were great. I didn't like the store manager she is very rude and doesn't know what she is doing. But the pay is good the customers are kind of crazy.
bad,"Overall the company as a whole was a good work environment however growth happening at such a rapid pace it was a challenge to have the infrastructure to accommodate the growth,"
bad,"Poor Store manager, not willing to give positive feedback to employees. Store Manager was lazy and unmotivated. Do not recommend to work here. Pay very low and minimum benefits."
bad,"Above the store manager level, the district supervisors are generally highly stressed & take it out on store employees.  My personal experience is that my supervisor would go from talking & laughing to crying to yelling and back to laughing in under 5 minutes.  The DM's refuse to speak to anyone below the district supervisor level."
bad,Manager picked who she liked and either ignored the rest or acted like we didnt exist and always pointed out flaws or found ways to get on us. i did like working there it was easy work and always went by fast.
bad,"Poor supervising, on your feet all day, no break room. Gave my two weeks and they took me off the schedule. Always wanted your uniform clean even though we work with food all day. Unless your desperate I'd keep looking else where"
bad,They over work their employees. They would make someone work until 11pm and come back in at 4am the next day. I didn't learn much the managers don't do anything they just sit in the office all day. The only thing I enjoyed about this job is the customers.
bad,The management at caseys is a joke. They will force you to work in the kitchen if you are sick or have an emergency and can't come to work. Minimum wage with low pay raises bad hours and all the cameras are pointed towards the employees as if your stealing. Unless you need a job asap and don't plan on sticking around they will hire you. The interview and hiring process is a joke as well. Basically show up for an interview and you have the job
bad,"The managers don't care, the area supervisors don't care, not even the employees care. They cut hours, move your shifts, and fire people at will. I don't recommend working here."
bad,"This is one of the worse places I have worked. Management does not know how to do their jobs, constant favortisim for certain shift, when one shift doesnt do their work it is left to the other shifts, and when that shift does their work the managment is constantly telling them that it is not done."
bad,"Managerial staff likes to control every little thing, they dont have a clue what is actually going on, and they honestly dont care. They will guilt you, make fun of you, and just make working an all around bad time."
bad,"While the job itself is fine, and the typical day at work wasn't actually that bad aside from being uneventful, there aren't exactly any pros to working here. I was asked, by the manager, to watch two other employees she insisted on scheduling me with because she suspected they were dealing drugs out of the store and stealing merchandise. This bespeaks and overall toxic work environment, and the manager seemed to always be stressed to the point of breaking."
bad,When I had started working there the store manager was on leave. So the assist manager and the 2nd key holder was working management in that store. The assist manger was a complete A-hole. My apartment had flooded due to a lot of rain that week and my place became a place where I could get very ill living there. So the assist manager wasn't willing to work with me to keep my job there as my apartment was being cleaned. On top of that she even stocked my place because she didn't believe it was flooded.
bad,"The store manager was rude and never happy. No matter how hard anyone worked she was never appreciative and never satisfied. She almost never said that you did a good job. She focused on the negative. I did, however, enjoy the job I was doing and the customers and the people I worked with."
bad,everyone quits or halfway does the job. if you work there your doing double shifts and so on. the district mangers and constantly nagging and pretty much just picking on there employees.
bad,Not worth applying for due to the lack of store managers experience and inability to do her job properly and help team members
bad,If you like being threatened with losing your job on a daily basis and being cursed at by management in front of co-workers and customers than this is the place for you!
bad,worst bosses iv ever had. They arent not fleaxible till you complain and then its a big deal to eveyone else. I love my job and I LOVE my customers. I just very much so dislike the people i work with. They are rude and back bitting old ladies with NO respect.
bad,They dont care if ur sick and puking u still need to be there or get fired. They are extremely lenient on some people and they have their prejudices it isn't fair to fire someone who has a doctor's note.
bad,Under staffed management out for themselves and play games with employees schedules favoritism all around terrible place too be wasting part of your life at
bad,Manager can't even make a schedule out more than a few days in advance and then it's always being changed ..... when the only thing that need to change is the management it's self !!!!!
bad,You can give your all and succeed at your job and corporate will still fire you at a moment's notice for literally anything.  I did win my unemployment because corporate is terrible.  But i was very good at my job and had been there over 5 years.  Really hurts your pride.
bad,I feel management does not hold everyone accountable for there actions. You have people that go above and beyond and management put you down. Unless they want something from you.
bad,"next to no training, left to just fend for self. there's a lot of drama, and problems with communication between employees. Managers often played favorites, and employees are treated like machines instead of humans!!"
bad,"Too many chiefs not enough Indians. Very understaffed, fast paced. And lazy lazy workers. I left due to working so hard to just get retaliation for reporting theft and drug use by a supervisor. It's a sad world. They refused to believe me until after I quit and they busted said employee"
bad,I was not given enough time to train. I was thrown into the position because the last 2 store managers had previously walked out. The area manager and DM was not even close to being friendly. They demoted me because I was too friendly with my employees but yet I had a very low turnover rate.
bad,i had some family problems so when i had to call in they wouldnt let me not call in. i was very upset and i couldnt work but i did anyway im really looking for a job were i can move around and help people and grow relationships with them
bad,"Casey's was an awful place to work. From corporate down, they did not care about the employees. I wasn't paid on time but it was my fault -- really??!"
bad,This store has a lot of backstabbing. Manager does not have a clue! Manager  does not listen to her employees. A lot of rules for employees but if you are a favorite of the manager you don't have to worry about following the rules and if you're not a favorite watch your back!
bad,"I would go in at 3:00am, never knowing what I was going to have to do before I could started my own job. All donuts had to be out by 5am. There was a breakfast person rarely. If not I had to have breakfast out by the same time also. Which was impossible. Then maintain the warmers & fill orders. Was forced to stay after scheduled time off or be wrote up. If job wasn't completed."
bad,"My girlfriend & I both worked at separate Casey's locations and both saw a similarity in the two. Mamagment was horrible. They definently showed favoritism towards a select few employees. For example, if they messed something up, even on a day you didnt work, you got called and screamed at and told it's all your fault. Even when you told them to check the papers of what you made and check the cameras, they refused to. Another problem I faced while in the kitchen is, it's a very high stres area, and we would consistantly run out of product. The manager did nothing to correct this and would constantly make everything your fault. Also, the manager was always in their office helping with nothing."
bad,"They expect far more than is remotely feasible, coworkers are surprisingly similar to twelve year olds, and favoritism runs rampant. Also, if you have any problems with your mental health, you can kiss it goodbye, no amount of therapy or medication will keep you on an even keel when faced with this place."
bad,Horrible company to work for. No appreciation for anything you do. Running all over the state to help out and working 140 hours a pay period and only being compensated for a 90 hour salary. This job affected me both physically and mentally. I loved my employees but in the end it just wasn’t worth it.
bad,My first day on job and was early I was yelled at in front of customers for not being clocked in. I explained that my co worker was showing me how to do that. She started my experience there awful. We were also told to put our own lives in danger to prevent theft!
bad,Fast paced very minimal help when needed. And keeping a good rotating work schedule was one of Casey’s biggest problems to me.and I only stayed there that long because it was hard to find a better paying job
bad,Supervisors are very condescending. They are very degrading to female employees. They show absolutely no respect or appreciation for their employees. Family life means nothing to them
bad,"I loved working at Casey's for a number of reasons. Management started to change and poor leadership skills dramatically affected the work environment. I found myself being one of the hardest working employees but getting criticized and punished quite often. I saw many problems and talked to get them addressed and I received less hours. The hours that I did have, did not work well with my schedule. Management was known to the issues that were happening but did not take any action to improve work environment and puts all the work on other employees. There are many issues currently with this store."
bad,"The management at my Casey’s was really bad. They tried to look for reasons to fire you. Let a manager date a non manager coworker. Management broke a lot of rules, including confidentiality. A lot of favoritism has happen and disrespect toward the employees there. Out of all the jobs I’ve had this was the worst one I worked for."
bad,"Poor management...lying, backstabbing, gossip and that was just management..more and more added on to work load for the same low pay.  And im not lazy, worked my butt off for the company and ended up getting screwed over"
bad,"worked here for almost 10 months, I went full time in June, and was eligible for benefits, that I never did get. This is the main reason that I left this job. Manager of this store really has no business being in management position, she has way too many favorites. Those individuals were given the hours they want and they days off they want, this is not fair to other associates. People would not really do their work that they were supposed to because they were a favorite of the manager. Schedules should have been rotated, not only certain people working days and others working nights.. Constantly having to come into my shift and do the work that the previous shift did not do which would cut into my time, and working evening shift there are a lot of pizza and sandwich orders that come through."
bad,"Very poor management. Best part of my job was doing what I love, pouring drinks and talking with customers. They have no employee handbook or written rules. Owner preferred young women."
bad,"Low paying job offering little advancement and no pay schedule.  Asked to do job of two employees, while managers favorites took cigarette breaks and talked on their phones."
bad,"afternoon/Evening Pizza cook and hot food prep, cleaning and pizza orders by phone and walk in, very busy too much for one person to do alone."
bad,"For my first job it wasn't too bad, good pay and good hours. Great people there too, at first. I usually just made pizzas in the kitchen and made some subs. Then the new hires came in and one of them was stealing pizzas from the warmer. I reported it and the manager did nothing about it. Then more people quit and there were few people who could work night kitchen. Too much drama, and unacceptable work ethics. My manager had me working in the kitchen when I was sick. Overall, this place is very unprofessional now."
bad,"They don't train you, they just throw you in and see what you can do on your own. You might not be able to get a break. On third shift you do not get a lunch break, you're lucky if you get a smoke break."
bad,"In september i began working at caseys as it was time for me to move on from sonic drive in, i am now 22 years old and i am looking for a job that i can turn into a career and grow from not something where i will be stuck my whole life. I found caseys to be a new job advancment, with a new work environment a chance to grow and new people."
bad,long hours are expected to get job done. There is no job security because area manager is unstable and targets people
bad,"Supervisor was intentionally harassing most managers she supervised, very condescending, her title was in her head and she was clueless.   Casey's lost many employees because of her."
bad,"It was poorly run and the schedule would consistently not get out for at least a couple days late, if not a week or over. People were not held accountable due to people feeling that if the manager did not have to do their job, then why should they?"
bad,"Extreme expectations for very little over minimum wage.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the other people that were struggling under Casey's ""Fiduciary Responsibilities""   They say they are a part of the community that they serve However they forget Their employees ARE part of that community as well!"
bad,"When i first started working there, everything was great.  Then after two weeks of rushed training, I was told I would be opening the store kitchen by myself.  Normally i would not have minded doing this, but after having sub par training from an impatient assistant manager, i was nowhere near ready for that."
bad,One of the hardest working employees in the store got told they didn't deserve the $1 raise that was just given to every single person in the district ( because of inflation). Another employee got accused for trying to get out of work after collapsing AT WORK because of medical reasons.
bad,"I was hired as the manager but as time went by I had poor training due to area supervisor (3 area supervisor) was overwhelmed and district manager didn’t care if I had the proper training. The district manager didn’t care if I needed help with lack of resources due to constant cuts. She was bully towards me and towards my employees. "
bad,"Job is fine, just don't like getting attacked by management, and other co workers, environment is not friendly and positive, if there were better management , hard to go to work when you feel sick"
bad,"In the span of 1 year we had went through 3 managers and the 3rd was the worst by far. There was definitely favoritism in the store. She would put all the work on the kitchen people, while cashiers did practically nothing besides sweep and mop, and the work that they didn’t do you’d have to do. Not to mention the racial slurs the 3rd manager would say to me. I got along with most crew members but that new manager was something else."
bad,"Went down hill. They fired my boss. Managers walked out a day later. Had random stores making our schedule, that didn't know our availability. Not scheduling enough people. Working whole shifts alone."
bad,Employees at my store were allowed to no call no show repeatedly with no consequences.  It was like working with a bunch of high school kids and they were actually adults.  Very disorganized.  Was threatened by another employee who came in intoxicated in the middle of the night.  Was reported to manager who did nothing because they were friends outside of work.
bad,While it seems like a good idea to work for them it's not. They don't care about their employees at all. They only care about themselves. They will heep a whole lot of responsibility on you with little training to be had.
bad,"miss leading - liberal - greedy . A typical day is always stressful, they allow the liberal ideas of being offended or raciest slip in with the drama.  It starts with the leadership always pointing it out.  Leaders need to take control of the employees instead of employees controlling the drama, while leaders are busy trying not to work and creating drama lacking in integrity. It makes most stores dysfunctional.  Ask most store employees and they are not happy.  There are good managers which control and appreciate their employees.  But the later is starting to take over, usually not enough hours for the customers they are trying to serve, they lack leadership.  Leaders should help and support their teams with positive attitudes,  All employees should have a positive attitude created by positive leadership.  Talking and teaching about it does not make it happen it should be implemented at all times.  to think of the cup being 1/2 full, not empty; to point out the positive while working on the negative. Leaders should think of the positive and look for the good in people not  create the worst idea of a person.  They should grow employees into role models not run them off, because of being put in stressful positions they are not ready for, because leaders will not take control unless a bad situation comes into play.  If they took a more positive approach it would build; instead of cracking their foundation.  When leaders think it is fun to ruin ones life because they are a hard worker and take their responsibilities of their employees very serious their is a problem.   So if looking"
bad,"Initially, I loved my job at Casey's. However, the longer I worked there, the more I realized it was not a stable job. The manager is immature and not fit to work in her position (Hillsboro Casey's). The workers were always great but management was awful. She would talk poorly about other workers to you(GOSSIP COMING FROM THE BOSS!! UNPROFESSIONAL) Instead of the manager filling in when people would call out, she would make workers do it. If you told her no because it was your day off or because you simply didn't want to work, she would have a severe attitude with you and tell you that you need to determine if you actually want to keep your job. SHE THREATENED JOBS OVER WORKING HOURS THAT WERE NOT SCHEDULED TO WORK. She would also change the schedule without alerting anyone and be upset if they were unaware of the schedule change. OVERALL, DO NOT WORK AT CASEY'S GENERAL STORE IN HILLSBORO."
bad,This job has the worst management they hire u part time but make u work 40+ hours a week they make false accusations n they dont care for their employees.  The pay is horrible and they expect alot out of u for little pay
bad,"I loved working at Caseys. Loved it!! The only reason i left, was to help my best friend and her mom take care of her sisters kids. (Her sister passed, leaving behind our 3 little angels for us). Shortly after i left, i noticed i hadnt gotten paid for my 8 hours of orientation,but everyone else did. I have been calling since i left. The manager refuses to talk to me or call me back. The main managers boss wont call me back. Corprate refuses to even accept my call. Indiana department of labor services will not even do anything. Althought the manager of the jasonville indiana caseys was my favorite manager ive ever had... I will never work there again because they are still withholding my pay."
bad,Casey's Was not a place I would recomend to another person because of the way they treated me upon my termination. They were verbally rude and didn't care about my feelings or my situation.
bad,"My friend and I both worked there, in that time she has been pulled off the schedule for unknown reasons twice. In less than a month. The manager is rude, unprofessional, and petty. While I worked there she would cut hours,  treat employees like children and expect them to apologize for personal differences between employees. Do not work here, while your coworkers are wonderful the management is not worth it."
bad,If you are an hourly employee you benefit more.  Salaried Mangers work non stop and so they don't have to pay regular employees overtime.  What you are expected to do verse they pay you receive isnt comparable.  Casey's takes away but expects more out of their managers
bad,Not worth it. Was an employee for over 2 years and it was not good. Worked tons of hours with not enough income. If you want something easy as a side job maybe but not as a main job.
bad,"Casey's started out as a good company to work for. For the past year, it has really gone down hill. They are severely making cuts to save the company from going under. They cut numerous of supervisor jobs to help with the savings. They have no heart. Some supervisors have put their heart into that business for over 22+ years and they tell them one day that their job is eliminated. They treat you like slaves. Whenever the store manager was needing help, do to being short staffed, they were never around to send a helping hand, they tell you that's the managers job, they need to figure it out. The turnover is ridiculous. They have no respect for the hard working employees."
bad,I was typically scheduled 42 hours a week and worked 3am-10am was not allowed to leave until my replacement showed up sometimes i would be there till almost noon.
bad,This was a terrible job. Casey's is always extremely understaffed and the managers their have no idea how to do their own jobs. I would not recommend employment with Casey's.
bad,"A typical day at work is making coffee, wiping counters, stocking everything, sweeping and mopping the floor, cleaning the bathroom, sweeping the parking lot, going in the cooler and the beer cooler. "
bad,"Poor/rude management and the turnover rate is high. If someone in the management team doesn't like you then you'll be pushed to quit or they'll fire you for just about anything. Some of their practices are questionable, but HR and the rest of the company doesn't care to do anything about it."
bad,When I first started with the company I loved my job < meeting people the flexible schedule. all that changed when we got an inexperienced manager. Hours were cut most all the guys were let go.
bad,Delivery driving alone gave me PTSD.  Working at Casey's General Store was like War: Long times of total boredom punctuationed by moments of shear terror.
bad,I used to love my job but when the new supervisor came in it really went down hill.  The company has a great benifit package but somewhere between the corporate office and the store level the chain breaks and it really becomes unbearable
bad,"My managers were absolutely terrible at making the employees working hours. I worked everyday and never had days off that I requested months before. I was bullied by other co workers and sometimes I feel extremely uncomfortable by the men who worked there. Some of the employees were perverted. I absolutely hated working at Casey's and I worked there for quite awhile. My manager screamed at me a lot and would talk behind employees backs. I was treated like a child even though I have worked there ever since the store first opened. I closed the store almost every night by myself and I always worked hard to make sure everything was done. I never took a break, ever. And I don't smoke so I was constantly in the kitchen working."
bad,"I worked very hard for 11 years,I did receive 4 weeks of vacation time and a 401 k . Management was poor . I had 7 managers during that time. I rarely had a break during the day and felt very unappreciated."
bad,Ceasy's has the worst management of any job ive ever worked most manager ar trained improperly. They dont care about their employees at all most employees get over worked and have no time at home. Just an all around poor place to work for
bad,I liked working for casey's just didn't get a with the district manager. that was the hardest part about working for casey's. I enjoyed some of the my co worker
bad,"the management is poor, the staff were rude. I wouldn't work there again. the job is easy and would be fun minus the drama. the location is remote. poor cleanliness."
bad,Always cleaning. Always on the move. Always taking pizza orders.
bad,"On a typical day, you hear complaints from management about poor work that was done by others. You work your butt off for low pay and no appreciation from management. Management had their click that was treated better than others (preferred hours, less work) and the preferred employees get invited to parties at manager's house. The more you know/work, the more management expect you to do."
bad,"First time doing a job like this, I expected adequate training. How the paperwork was to be done changed day-to-day, the other co-workers were less than helpful, I did not like the use of dish detergent for windshield washer fluid, and it was rather stressful. In my short time there I learned you need to know the other workers there before you even have a chance to keep your job. Expecting someone new who's never even worked at a place like that before, not knowing where cleaning supplies were, who was doing what, or how to do a lot of things, it's completely unacceptable to expect someone to know everything after four hours of ""this does this."" The hardest part was trying to find cleaning supplies and such, since they were never put in a designated area, but I felt good knowing I worked hard and followed the policies as closely as I could and felt I did very well, considering being thrown to the sharks."
bad,They expect you to give up your life to them  Never set schedules very poor pay for what they want you to do no one is happy and they expect employee’s to unload the trucks each week and they give an hour to complete unloading
bad,"Hours where nice but having reliable coworkers was non existent. Almost everyday someone called off, and upper management didn’t do anything about it. The job is not hard at all, I enjoyed the work itself. Just the work environment was terrible."
bad,The managers were to picky to hire anyone so we were always short and they would leave one person to run kitchen and store alone all night . The manager was rude and didn't care about anyone's schedule and would put them on whatever shift no matter what. She ended up getting fired for stealing money.
bad,"All of the fixtures, cash registers, and gas pumps were made cheaply this makes the job more frustrating as fixtures fail every shift.  Labor costs are kept to a minimum so I felt often over worked and under appreciated.  Manager was less qualified than I was to run the store; Whenever I asked him a question it was always “I don’t know”.  The job is supposed to be easy but is made stressful by corporate’s unrealistic expectations and local management’s inability to preform."
bad,"Calling off sick is pointless, especially since scheduling is so tight to the point of everything spiraling downward if *one* person calls off. Despite being told during my interview that employees had to work nights and weekends to be employed there, quite a few employees later on were able to get exclusively day shifts without even asking. You're expected to do your own stuff and pick up slack from previous shifts that didn't bother finishing up their stuff or even communicating that ""hey I didn't finish X thing, just a heads up"". "
bad,The hardest part of the  job was lack of training and support from the Area Supervisor and District Manager.  Plus all the hours that I had to put in weekly.
bad,I hate working here. I used to enjoy it but now it is nothing but stressful and awful. I have been working here for 4 years with barely any advancement and horrible management.
bad,Management doesn't make proper schedules or show appreciation whenever they leave an employee in an uncompromising position. Co-workers are unhappy so the team effort and morale is low.
bad,When I was working at Casey general store this was a dirty work environment that had mice running around. Management was poor who was hardly there and on drugs.
bad,"I worked with Casey's from June to December and I have never felt more disrespected or underestimated. The pay is to low and the management is unsupportive. Expire food sits and waits for ""someone else to deal with it"". The managers were telling employees my personal and confidential information.  In return the employees (ages vary 21 to 73) told the customers that same information. It's more like a play house than a job and the food shows for it. We have corporate offices in our store monitoring our services but they have proved no help also. Tha k you! would tell the customers."
bad,I worked at a new store and everyone was so disorganized. Manager was stealing money and everything. The entire staff was undertrained. Rarely were there enough staff to float the store in rushes.
bad,"Stressful. Long hours. I did enjoy my time there, and very much liked most of my co-workers. Just time to move on, and do something else. Will miss some of it."
bad,Loved working with customers and public. Hours were not very flexible hours were different every day or week as schedule wasn't always made out. Many people would have to cover other people's shifts due to lack of staff
bad,"awful the mangement was not flexible at all with hours, i constantly was working 40+ hours a week with no benefits, and then would get called in on my days off, horrible company to work for"
bad,"helping customers , making sure the entire store was clean , restocking store inventory , cooking and preparing food orders , and also did cashiering"
bad,Never wish I started but to bad I had to. Wish they did more background checks on staff. Oh and come and check up on their employees
bad,The managers at Casey’s don’t care about there employees. It’s another company that looks at you like your a number not a human. They are flexible with schedule only good part about working at Casey’s  easy work
bad,"Do not work at the Caseys in McAlester or Hartshorne!! The area supervisor has a specialty for setting you up to fail. I worked there for four months, became assistant manager after two months because of my work ethics then I was offered the store manager position in the 4th month of being there. I’m 19 years old and they wanted me to run that store! I asked about a raise and was denied."
bad,"Horrible place to work.  Someone always calling off, u having to stay late and work 7 days straight.  No lunch breaks or weekends off. Once management leaves they forget about u"
bad,Working for Casey's was OK at first. But they only trained me for like 2 days and told me that next day. I will be alone and I will have to try by myself. I was told by other co workers than you are suppose to be trained for a week. They trained me and one other person for 3 days. Also the assistant manger always was making up problems about me.
bad,"I worked as an overnight cashier, which included both checking out customers and cleaning everything inside the store and out except for the kitchen. Most nights, there was not enough time to complete all the work required. The people in charge of distributing tasks clearly had no idea how many customers actually come in during the overnight shift. It is less than other shifts, obviously, but it's not completely dead. I would say there was 5+ hours worth of cleaning alone to do per night and maybe 3 hours to do it if you were lucky. "
bad,"no Teamwork, no advancement, poor wages, no benefits, work 6 days a week, 4 to 6 hour shifts so your busy everyday. You can not call off unless there is a replacement."
bad,Loved my job at Casey's general store but the management there is very poor!! Love the job.                       Poor and I mean very poor management
bad,Fun place to work with the right co-workers.  sometimes asked to do more than what you get paid for. it can be a stressful job because it does get busy.  on your feet a lot.
bad,"This company does not care about you or your needs. Be prepared for them to ask the WORLD of you because ""everything is your job"" but god forbid anyone on second shift finish their jobs. It's fine if you don't ever work with management but you have a bunch of co-workers that don't want to even do their share of responsiblities so you are likely to just do everything anyway."
bad,we have an assistant manager who isn't willing to work when there is a problem after work. I was left on my own on my sixth day. The manager quit on us.
bad,"The District Manager did not know how to properly use the system and had to bring along a ""favored"" employee to run reports when he did a store check. He shared employee salary information. He reviewed video seeing employee theft and DID NOT allow me to fire the employees or contact the police.  I'd like to hope that this District Manager is no longer employed and that the other locations do not have the same issues that I did."
bad,"Horrid work experience overall. Only pro was the people I worked with. Openers are left to do everything alone for an hour or more, with no one else in the store."
bad,A lot of young adults work there. There always seems to a lot of drama. Nobody wants to do their job. The manager doesn't hold anyone accountable. She leaves notes but doesn't confront problems in person.
bad,I didn't like it here. They like to micro- manage you.. I'm grown and I have a good work ethic; you don't have to stand over me to see what I'm doing.
bad,"Worked at the Casey's in Alexandria, IN. Management is terrible and if they don't like you or think you're a bad worker they will target you. I was not properly trained and was constantly told to do new tasks every day that didn't really have anything to do with my job description (i was in kitchen). Managers wanted us to do ""task lists"" that were completely outdated. Playing favorites is definitely a thing. They will push people they don't like to quit. Not a hard job , just horrendous management."
bad,Highest turnover rate I’ve ever witnessed. The amount of people that called in is absurd. The manager poorly scheduled people and never ordered right so the truck night was always a pain. Too much chaos.
bad,"Look I’m going to save you the headache just don’t work there. When I started Casey’s it was fun and then I seen how horrible management really is and how poorly you get treated, I lived an about hour away from the one I worked at. They wrote me up because they changed the schedule mid week and didn’t tell me so on the second day if me having 2 days off they called and got mad because I didn’t check the schedule for. I thought it was just that Casey’s the sucked so. Li worked at the one across the street dome my house and I never got payed normally, I had to call corporate each tike everyone else got payed because my manager give someone else  my card info and gave me a  dead card, then she refused to fix it"
bad,"I'm not sure about the company over all because I read that in other areas Caseys is a great fun place to work. However, at the stores in my area it is not a fun or great place to work. The area managers( the first two that are directly above the store manager) have the worst attitudes and seem to take pleasure in the suffering of those they manage. If these two people were removed from scenario, I'm sure it would be a great job. In fact if I ever found out they were gone I would happily re-apply and work there again."
bad,"times this job was very busy and fast pace. "
bad,"Scheduling issues, rude and profound general manager, always did what I could for the store even taking on extra shifts to help my manager out, at times had to pull shifts at other stores just to get hours."
bad,"No scheduled lunch or breaks made long shifts dreadful, cut corners to save corporate money yet produced more food then what would sell resulting in trashing hundreds of lbs daily, handling the trash I directly witnessed this waste, employees discounted meal had to be eaten on site and every single oz of drink recorded by manager or closing cashier nightly"
bad,"Poor management and training. There is no work-home life balance. If you are sick you have to have someone cover your shift or you cannot go home. Even if you come back with a doctors note, missing the days will still be counted against you."
bad,"Poor management, lower hours, more workers, clean store up, needs help, learn how to respect and talk yo people. Appreciate your workers and managers."
bad,I enjoyed my job. I was job having to give up my job to stay home with my newborn. I would suggest it to anyone who seeks a simple and pleasant work environment.
bad,Some of the people were nice but they were not very family oriented I had just had my child and was having difficulties at the time with babysitters. they released me because I could not find a sitter. now its not an issue at all.
bad,"Typical day at work was busy, always have something to. I learned about patience when working with the public. The workplace culture is very fast paced and always different. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the phone stopped ringing for food."
bad,"Horrible place to work, horrible management, you either get all the hours or no hours at all. Nothing you do is EVER right. I do not recommend working for them"
bad,Nonononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononon
bad,I liked working here i cried when they let me go. The only thing i didnt like was one time a customer came in and started getting attitude with me told my boss she banned him for a while from the store. And they didnt work me that long so i could have gotten better trainning if they would have worked me more longer than they did.
bad,did not enjoy much when came to management... different rules 4 different ethenticity.... loved serving people an being a waitress though
bad,ran cash register and cleaned everthing stocked coolers cups etc
bad,This company was so fun to work for however management was horrible
bad,They dont care about anyone other then themselves. As long as they dont get what they want they wont do anything for the store or the customers needs to make them happy. I had to pick up there slack. Specially the Managers.
bad,A nice place to work for and learn alot from and had alot of work to do and a short time to do it but it had to be done no matter what and they where the first company to do something for me for serving our countrey they presented me with coin and it really mkade me feel good that someone cares about our service men and women
bad,A lot of call offs and you were made to go in regardless of what you had going on in your life even tho you weren't scheduled to even work. I loved some of my coworkers but that about it
bad,"Area Managers do not help store managers like they should I don't know if they don't have the hours or if they are overwhelmed by their responsibilities, they are just glad not to be a store manager anymore. The District Managers was rude to all employees. The employees are very hardworking and underappreciated by all upper management."
bad,Management was terrible! Very toxic workplace. They are okay will selling pest infested/contaminated food products. They don't care if another employee has or is threatening you or co workers. Corporate doesn't care to fix how things are ran.
bad,"Management here was not good, at all, constantly changing store managers, leaving assistants by themselves, no one ever showed up for work, nothing ever"
bad,"Its not Casey's in general i just happened to have really bad management,  who showed favoritism to her best friends who worked there ,  hours where never consistent,  either working over time or less then 20 hours"
bad,"The hours were very inconsistent. Do not even consider having to call off for a sick child, that is with a doctors note, if you can not handle a manager retaliating by cutting your hours or making you work longer/split shifts.Over worked, very over worked and under paid. Especially those who work hard and do their jobs right. The hard workers were taken advantage of while those who slacked on the job had better hours and pay along with not being reprimanded."
bad,"No consecutive work schedules! No free time on days and scheduled time off, to make plans for own life's needs. On days that you are scheduled to work, you schedule can change by a drop of a hat, and if you have plans, for the time your not scheduled that day, you HAVE to change them or forget about them,period."
bad,"I worked for Casey's for 5 yrs.  The management was poor,  she didn't know how to do anything in the kitchen which you are supposed to be trained to do before you go to management, i couldn't get my vacations or evaluations.  It took me 3 yrs to get a 30 cent raise which is b.s. The company is ridiculous it's so worried about the amount of stuff you put on a pizza as if two extra olives are costing them a fortune, but they throw away 30gal trash bags full of food out 4 or 5 times a day. Idiots"
bad,Working at Casey’s was a temporary thing for me...it was like being in high school all over...it was more drama happening than actual work...the pay was bare minimum...insurance way too high...management was poor because they were into the drama more than doing their job
bad,Management doesn't communicate and when they do it's like a game of telephone. Nothing is ever said right. There is way too much drama between employees and management.
bad,"It was not fun working here. Not enjoyable, the management and staff where not very knowledgable and showed a lot of favoritism towards certain employees"
bad,its a good company to work for if you have the right team working with you and manager to back you but because the manager could not control the other employees and then leaves you to try and fill their hours and shifts but for the most part the company is great
bad,"If you like being looked down on by litterally everyone on earth this job is perfect! From the air headed staff, to the entitled townsfolk (most of which make even less money than you will) you guarenteed to want to kill sombody every single day, even yourself!"
bad,"Was not happy with training I received, went through 4 managers in three years, rules changed when ever new manager was hired. Costumer complaints numerous times on same employee's nothing would be done about, good employee's discharged or quit due to unfair treatment."
bad,I did not have a set schedule. My manager was not helpful with teaching me the basics about my position. She was unable to complete her job and yelled about how unoraginzed everyone else was.
bad,"Unless you are willing to work as a slave, turn back now. My two year experience included: Perpetual staff shortage, irresponsible management and generally a bad attitude from regular employees to area supervisors. No one was optimistic about their future, least of all myself, being paid so poorly with no affordable benefits (bar 401k). Unless you are applying for a store manager position or higher, I would not recommend this job to any person not in the direst of straits."
bad,"i was responsible for daily books, work kitchen, checking in vendors, ordering, truck, scheduling, banking, checking gas prices.  I was also expected to do all this and be on the register at least 1/2 if not more than of my shift.  I was expected to work longer than my scheduled hours to get things done but definitely not paid enough for that.  I was to be on call 24/7.  my phone rang constantly.  upper management was no help and I was threatened to lose my job everyday.  their cure for all problems was to write up the staff as if I had time for that.  I would be wrote up for things that my supervisor did and even told me to do.  I have never been so happy to leave a job in my life and getting out of there has been a blessing.  I miss my customers and co workers and that is it.  caseys needs to learn how to train their managers and staff."
bad,"Receive cash and debit/credit card transactions, clean the store, train new employees.  Responsible for stocking and aiding customers."
bad,"Hours are to long for the Pay rate they want to pay you.  After 3 months your increase is only 5 cents which is not alot for standing 9 hours a shift."
bad,"management was all over the place, telling co workers how bad they was doing but never noticing the good the employees did. Never did any of the work, always sat back and watched which is not good management to me definitely if their going to critisize an employees work but not willing to show them how to do it. Hours varied too much and they didn't work well with my school schedule. I was forced to make the choice whether to keep my part time job and fill in for an employee who called in to watch tv with family and not graduate or to graduate high school and lose my job."
bad,"Shirts are from 3:30 a.m.-8 a.m."
bad,"however, i do not recomend applying. i have worked there almost a year, was there when i was needed, and worked my but off for them. they then moved me shifts without consulting me first, cut my hours. after almost 3 months on sed shift they cut my hours again."
bad,This job is good if you're already on your feet and in a stable environment and living situation. My life situation is difficult and this job is not exactly easy. And I don't make enough to support my life expenses
bad,Always understaffed which creates a lot of employee animosity. No time for home life. Yearly raises up to .25 based on attendance and performance. Not allowed to be sick ever.. management is ok as long as you never tell them you can't do something.
bad,"Depending on the store manager it could be a good place to work. However, the manager at my store received numerous complaints from customers and employees which were made to corporate and she still has her job."
bad,I had great customers at Casey's as well. I loved my co workers. The manager did his best but he got to the point where he just kind of starting having everyone else do what he should have been doing. He would not cover shifts if needed. Again that is only at this location. I am not speaking for all locations. I am also disabled so I do believe that has alot to do with me review.
bad,"Management is horrible, they never helped out on shots, when they did they acted like it was an inconvenience. They wouldn't cover shifts if someone called in. The manager had no clue how to do his job. When we started he would come ask me questions."
bad,"Poor management,  worked alot of hours even when not scheduled. Always had to work over cause people wouldnt show up on time. No communication from management.  Poor moral of store. Not somewhere I would recommend someone to work at."
bad,"I have worked at 3 separate locations and in each one the managers are petty, constantly gossiping about other employees. They hand you this laundry list of things to do that are impossible to complete in an 8 hour shift and you get a write up for overtime or a write up for not completing list."
bad,"It was usually fast pace between cooking, answering the phone, cleaning, stocking and helping customers as they come in especially during rush hours, between those times it was very quiet and gave you time to do other chores"
bad,"Nothing great about it. It’s a gas station job. Manager was irritated by the “low wage thugs” working for her, refused to work with your schedule. Vacations have to be approved, will be looked down on for asking for it. They will schedule you for 39 hours but refused to go over 40 because they don’t want to pay overtime. Overtime is highly discouraged. Benefits are only for full-time employees such as management."
bad,Management  never seemed to care. Always was playing favorites. No consequences really for policy breaking. Always walked into a dirty store from night shift. My store hardly had a manager on night shift. Never ever would go back.
bad,The main problem is management. They let the workers who do the bare minimum get away with it and do not praise the workers who actually do their job.
bad,"The company is constantly trying to save money so they cut hours, and when they cut hours it leaves us stressing over getting everything done. A lot of the time, you cannot complete all that is expected of you because of these cut hours. I understand if they have more than enough hours, but when you keep cutting after cutting, customers are going to get upset as well as employees who are not getting the hours they need to make ends meet. The management I had was no good, but I do not want to blame that on all stores in the US. For this kind of job, it seems they expect so much out of you. More than people might think or expect. There is always something to do, but when they cut hours you cannot get the necessary things done and then they wonder why."
bad,"must be able to multi task, ability to account for and handle large amounts of cash. knowledge or register and handheld computer systems is helpful. social skills appropriate quick interactions with customers, outgoing personality"
bad,i worked for Casey's for a long time and by now i can tell you that the corp. office doesn't care about the store employees they care about making money and haven't figured out that if the employees are miserable that the customers will be and then stop coming but that is not the only issue i and another employee there worked as kitchen manager and 2nd assistant manager for years and were constantly told we couldn't move up while they hired other managers from the outside to be our manager and assistant manager the people they hired were horrible at the job and very crooked back stabbing people who tried to set you up for failure and cause and spread a lot of drama in the store and that is something i cant stand behind when you have to hard working experienced manager wanting to move up but instead outsourcing on Facebook to hire horrible managers
bad,"The issue with 2nd shift is that they are blamed for everything. 1st shift is considered the ""high traffic"" time of customers and they get no side work done (i.e. making coffee, cleaning the floors/bathrooms, and taking care of the morning trash) so we're supposed to do all their work as well as do our side work. And there is a double standard to take care of the customers, side work, and don't go overtime, but don't leave things undone. I've been threatened multiple times that i would be ""wrote up"" or fired if I didn't finish something I had full intentions on doing. You are blamed for people driving off and not paying for their gas. You will be a scapegoat."
bad,"For me in particular I worked every single weekend. So I would work the busiest hours by myself, and make at least 30 pizza's every night. Some nights on a weekend you would get no breaks in a 7 hour work day, and since it was only 7 hours your paycheck wouldn't be that great. It was a lot of responsibility, which I was okay with, but the compensation for all the jobs I did, plus making pizza's for all the customers, was not enough. I couldn't afford to live on my own with that type of wage."
bad,this job is extremely stressful. way more than it should be. my manager does absolutely nothing and relies on everyone else to do her job. it’s the worst job i’ve ever had.
bad,"i would open the door clock in then go to the kitchen and pull out the frozen doughnuts and put them on trays start the oven,then put them in the oven make tea,make the batter for the cake doughnuts and put them through the fryer."
bad,"While working at Casey's General store I ha to have a major surgery.  I was to be off work for at least a month.  Before I left for my surgery I was promoted to Kitchen Manager. When I came back I was told that the manager told every employee that they was not to help me with anything and she showed my medical papers and personal information to other employees.  When our stock was being delivered she would not let anyone help me put anything away, and she knew I was on a weight limit."
bad,"Did not take care of employees and did not listen to employees concerns. Management didn't train anyone, and constantly left notes instead of confronting employees"
bad,"I have worked for this company for almost 3 years and I really can tell you that this company is awful. My manager sucks. Really the only good thing about working here is that you get half off food, but only when you're working."
bad,"I liked the job,but not how things were ran.There were favorites and they got all the hours.There was no cross training with new employees.Too many chiefs and not enough Indians."
bad,Managment was ridculous. Hours were never set and the work emviorment was stressful. Only enjoyble part of the job is being social with the general public.
bad,"Starting my shift I cooked donuts, then made 2 pizzas, glazed, iced, and frosted the donuts on a new tray, started one of my three loads of dishes, after half an hour I would transfer the donuts to a new tray and set them aside for transfer to the case. I could count the donuts out that were staked from the day before, throw those away and put the dirty trays on the back counter in the kitchen to be cleaned. Then proceed to put fresh donuts out then fill out paperwork. Make 2 more pizzas for the warmer, then do my 2 loads of dishes in the kitchen."
bad,"Unfortunately the manager I have is NOT a good manager. He is a great person, but a bad manager. No one does what they are supposed to do, or listens to the manager or assistant managers. It is NOT  good place to work and I am leaving as soon as I find a new job."
bad,"Working here is rough and they never seem able to keep employees. They are always short staffed. When I was hired they knew of my intentions to go to school in the fall and said they would work with me on it. After several attempts to fix the issue, nothing was resolved."
bad,"The manager takes her time on everything she does such as getting the product we NEED, etc. but she is very nice. Employees are very nice. They change your schedule whenever they want."
bad,"Depending on who you're working with, your shifts can either be a blast or they can be complete torture. No one wants to do their part, and everyone id's always pointing fingers and blaming others. A lot of cliques and bullying that management does not mind and does nothing to change."
bad,The job itself is fine. The management and employees not so much. I get blamed for stuff that I didn't do or that some else did.  You will have to do more than just your job.
bad,"I would get there at four a.m. and general wouldn't leave until three p.m. or later."
bad,"Not a friendly work environment, poor management, and no flexibility. Management provided us with 4-6 managers within the two years I have been there."
bad,"From top level corporate to in store managers, down to hourly wage employees, very poorly run. Training overlooked or neglected. Cameras everywhere to see if employees are stealing, none in parking lot to stop gas theft, none in store to protect in case of robbery."
bad,poor management skills. inability to work with employees and give a set schedule rather than a very random schedule where you work numerous doubles and get scheduled for 10-14 hour shifts.
bad,Casey's General Store is a good place to work if you are looking for a part time job.  The pay is on the low side.  Store and assistant managers get paid almost the same as part time employee's.  If looking for advancement this is not the company.  They don't care how hard you work the harder you work the less likely you will be offered advancement in the company.  Casey's General Store does not care about their employee's or their employee's family.
bad,"A typical day at Caseys would consist of anywhere from 9 hours to 16 unless two or three shifts back to back were in order and there was no one to cover. The district manager and area supervisor that I was under when I left did not know their head from a hole in the ground. When I first became a manager I had people that stood behind me and helped in making sound decisions, when I left the last year I was there it was nothing but running the managers into the ground and treating them like children."
bad,"I ran the cash register, did the payroll, scheduling and updated books on a daily basis."
bad,"customers coming in and always talking to you and giving you a hard time. i Have learned that working with the public was indeed fun. co workers were also fun to work with. job was not hard, cleaning stocking coolers and the shelves , the enjoyable part was the customers"
bad,"Keep store clean, stock shelves , helping customers, cooking foods for hot station & opening & closing duties"
bad,"not a family friendly company. very little pay, very little room for advancement, if you do advance you make a little over minimum wage. co workers were great, but management never enforced rules. most enjoyable was my customers, the hardest was dealing with upper management, worked you to the bone for little pay."
bad,"It was a very basic gas station job. Not very friendly people, and I felt unwelcome. It wasn't easy to get a day off, the management often called me in on my days off to come in."
bad,"My job includes taking and filling opt orders from customers. The management in my particular store is lacking, as we have gone thru 3 GM's in as bout as many years. however i have made some great acquaintances thru working there."
bad,It could be a good job for a second job or for a job if it's your first one teaches you hard work multitasking people interaction money management and how to engage with people
bad,"Manager is unfair,  juvenile and not a positive person. When dealing with employees on a daily basis often gets irritated when not in control.  Is often giving the ""silent treatment "" to employees."
bad,I loved my job when I first started at Casey's. But it soon turned into a nightmare. Soon after I became 2nd assistant manager our store manager quit without notice and the district manager was not willing to help us hire new employees but expected me and the 1st assistant manager to work 16+ hour shifts at times and a regular shift became 10+ hours. The culture there is stressful and the team members are overworked and underpaid.
bad,"Not enough pay for what they want you to do "
bad,"Over worked, Under paid. Judgey manager that talks trash to the employees he likes. Scheduled however manager wants, not what you were hired for. (Hired for evenings, switched to mornings.) Many days were understaffed. Constant staff turn around due to an awful manager. District manager is unpleasant and doesn't understand what the job is like."
bad,"The job itself was easy, but management was hardly there during the evening shift and I was not properly trained in several things, resulting in me getting reprimanded for not doing things properly."
bad,Over all there is no job safety at all at Casey's and the hours are always cut do to over hiring and then raised here and there to her over firing of people
bad,"At first I really enjoyed working here, my co workers are great. But the general manager is a nightmare he likes to verbally abuse workers and customers. He has called everyone including customers that we are all stupid and useless"
bad,I honestly didn’t care for the job that much. I had a horrible experience. I lost my mother in law & my unborn child while working there. They didn’t care about their employees
bad,Absolutely the worst place i have ever worked. They barely train you and then just let you loose to figure everything out by yourself. Management picks favorites. So much drama in the work place its ridiculous.
bad,Management is poor across the board in every store I've worked at. Employee morale is lacking. Discounted food during your shift and free fountain drinks.
bad,Worked there 1.5 years or so. In that time I made it up to 2nd assistant manager. Truly enjoyed the job but the company likes to pull a lot of bs. They sued one guy for taking an empty pizza box to the dumpster for larsony. Eventually fired me after all the bs they put me through cuz a customer claimed I was doing drugs at work. I was actually on a smoke break infront of the store. They don't keep security camera outside the store so they fired me for lack of proof. . they also had a big roach problem they refused to take care of
bad,I was hired to work the cashier spot but for some reason was put in the kitchen with no prior conversation about it.  I was promised 25hrs/wk and at the beginning I was working more that but that quickly changed with winter and then I was barely getting 10hrs/wk. Empty promises on top of constantly getting micromanaged is enough to make any one hate working at the Casey's I worked at. I only worked at this one so I can't speak to the whole company but when I reported the incident to corporate offices they said they investigated it and apprrioate action had been taken which I found out meant nothing really happened.
bad,"Was in an extreme amount of pain for a week before my doctor sent me to the hospital only to find out most of the ligaments in my knee were messed up and one was bulging outwards. Manager was really uncaring with the situation and called me unprofessional/only cared if I was coming in that night after I explained that I was in the ER, I was then pressured to quit the job. It really wasn't the best and we were underpaid for everything that we did anyways."
bad,Not an enjoyable environment the management is very Christian and make sure anybody who isn’t feels uncomfortable about it. They like to nitpick and micromanage. Work is difficult for the pay
bad,Managers were terrible. I was always doing everyone else's job for them without any return for me. The environment was childish and unchecked. I would not recommend working at Casey's.
bad,"Check out customers."
bad,"Managers where very unprofessional. "
bad,"Casey's is a good store to work at, but there is times where there is lack of management. Casey's is a relaxed at times job and also a quick passed job and it can also be competitive."
bad,Current store manager is terrible. She lies about working with your availability and then schedules you for whatever.  If you work nights it's always your fault if something wasn't done.  If she doesn't like you she will do everything to try and fire you. If you call in you are forced to find your own replacement otherwise you have to be there.
bad,I was not pleased with the job i was dealing with some medical stuff and lost my job cause of it. Was treated poorly screamed and yelled at in front of customers by my boss. For having to leave work do to medical reasons.
bad,"I like it the people are fine. One manger you can tell doesn't really like people that much, but it's a chill place once you get the hang of everything. Also while training nobody told me when to take a break or told when I can."
bad,"I like working with my co-workers. It was the managers that made me hate working there. If your not one of their favorites then they would talk about you and yell at you in front of everyone, including customers."
bad,"Disorganized and poor management. Unreliable when covering or taking care of shifts. Delivery Drivers make additional $2.00 delivery plus tips, but rarely make tips."
bad,better hope you dont have a death in the family. i had to work twice in one day to get someone to cover my shift just so i could make it to my close uncles memorial.
bad,I was with Casey's General Store for over a year. During that year I experienced what it was like to work in a fun and functional work environment to the total opposite of total chaos. I fully believe the functionality of a business and the success of the business depends on management. I worked for an amazing manager in the beginning and when she left her replacement was insufficient and it was no longer fun going into work.
bad,They pick and chose favorites. You cab mess up and get in trouble but the favorite safe always safe. People try to find ways for you to get into trouble over accidents or dumb incidents that are harmless...I've seen it all one of the most dramatic places I've ever worked with.  Would not recommend this place...half the workers have hair hanging in their food prep or don't rotate food products appropriately. ..
bad,Management needs to be trained in interacting with other human beings in a professional way. Employees are expected to go above and beyond but there is little compensation for those who do. They schedule 7 hour shifts or less so that they are not required by law to give people breaks. Overall a horrible place to work if you want to get anywhere in life.
bad,"I got this job as an in between job, from the little time spent there I hated it.  I am not cut out for gas station jobs not my cup of tea...................."
bad,We were losing people left and right. The management is poor. People are very judgmental and there is a lot of drama in the work place. Nobody wants to show up for their shifts so we are constantly short handed.
bad,Everything about working here was terrible. The management was lacking and barely ever there. Most of the other employees were never on time for shifts. Very poor work enviorment
bad,"Poor Management from store level to area and district level. Rules are not followed. Schedules aren't even made until the day before someone is supposed to work. Management is very unprofessional, gossipy, and altogether disconnected from their employees"
bad,The Casey's I worked at in Hastings was not managed well. The manager promised every other weekend off but I ended up working doubles every weekend. When I asked for a day off she told me I couldn't have a day off and I would need to figure something else out or reschedule my appointments around the hours I was given.
bad,"If you want to deal with 40+ year olds that have the mentalities of high schoolers, then by all means apply here. If not, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
bad,"I wasn't treated so much as employee, more a small child. I constantly was treated like a bad 5 year old that didn't know anything."
bad,"Negative attitudes, negative experienc overall bad place to work. a lot of back and forth catty high school drama that doesn't need to be in the work environment."
bad,There was always something that needed to be done. Always kept me on my feet. I made delicious pizzas every hour for customers and also completed phone in orders. My co-workers and I always worked as a team.  Seeing smiles on the customers faces was the most enjoyable part of my job!
bad,The management was horrible but I was able to meet and mingle with various people on a daily basis.
bad,"Terrible job, with personal safety concerns. It is not in a good neighborhood and Casey's is bad to their employees."
bad,"on call 24/7/365 was not a good thing for me"
bad,"Does not pay enough for all the work you do. Sometimes the Managers let it go to their head to much. The hardest part of the job is the cleaning. The most enjoyable part of the job is waiting on customers and running the cash register. And I also enjoyed making the fresh Pizzas, they do have one of the best Pizzas."
bad,a typical day was running the cash register. management was never really there and when they were there they stayed in the back office. some co-workers were not friendly people and not to customers either.
bad,"Not the greatest place to work. Most everyone is lazy. And you don't get paid enough for what you have to put up with.   Not much else to say. I am looking for other work, i only enjoy cashiering"
bad,i worked everyday I helped cook I cleaned I ran the register I learned that even if the job is stressful you have to keep pushing to get the job done the hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers
bad,"Worked fulltime for a year never to receive benefits.  Large turnover with inadequate training of newer employee's.  "
bad,Casey's is an ok job if its your first job but as someone who is looking for career advancement there is not much in the way of that favoritism is very much a part of the way new managers are picked
bad,"Overall if it wasn't for the favoritism, poor management, and underhanded things that went on in the store it might have been a good place to work. But when you have a manager that lies to your face, an employ that is the managers favorite and no matter what that person does gets praised. When that favorite is charged with indentity theft and still working there. Manager constantly under ordered stock and product, causing issues with customer service."
bad,"I like my manager, but the company overall has a lot of work to do in their treatment of employees. They also have a lot of work to do when it comes to properly training upper management on how to get the very best out of those below them on the chain of command. There is a lot of hostility between management levels and this effects the overall employee moral. "
bad,"A stressful, underpaid for customer interaction job, which is not focused around teamwork."
bad,I put in 7 hr and had no lunch and no brakes only if your a smoker  you can go and have a smoke and I had to do two persons job I had to make about 200 to 300 Donuts and have breakfast and pizzas made at short period time and for a one person to all that it  was overwhelming and even if you try to take a Break it would fall you behind with your job duties
bad,Worked here for 3 years and someone that got here 3 months ago got the position I was promised keep making me work all 3 shifts no family time hate it
bad,Everyone is snippy and no one works their scheduled shifts. No one gives anyone else a break and people tend to go on smoke breaks for much longer than they should.
bad,"At Casey's anyone can get hired, and keep a job, meaning you can be completely irresponsible... be late almost every day, not do your job properly, and still be okay. This is not how to run a company which is what made me quit the job."
bad,"typical day is relatively easy, you get the good customers and the bad ones and then you have to deal with the drama from your coworkers."
bad,I worked from 3 a.m. to 11 a.m. at a busy location. I made donuts and all bakery items before we opened at 5 a.m. I had so much to do in so little time from 3 to 5 and I would often still be at least 30 minutes behind despite rushing to get everything done on time. From 5 a.m. onward there was not much to do and I often wondered what to do and why I was even still there.
bad,"i would come in at 4pm to make pizzas, and sometimes not leave until 8am. i would switch to the cashier on the overnight or have to do doughnuts. nobody else would cover the shifts. not even the store manger. only one of the manger would come help"
bad,"The location on West O st is managed quite poorly and because of that I quit showing up for work. I watched multiple employees, including a manager, break down and cry from the stress of working there while at work. Any other location would hopefully not be as bad. And the benifits are pretty bad a's well after 6 months you get a week paid vacation every year but that's the best they offer."
bad,"I never knew what I would be doing, relief often came late if at all and management was always disorganized. I would often have to complete tasks that we're only for management."
bad,I liked working there my first 4 years I got to many hours because I wanted more money and they asked for me because I was so good. My last year was the hardest cuz I dont believe I got enough training to be a manager.
bad,"My first year at this company was fun and worth my time however as the months went on I began to notice a trend of favoritism. If management knew you outside of work, you received the better shifts. I would go around two weeks with only one day off in between. Occasionally I would be expected to work a double without being aware. Overall, I wouldnt want to work at the same store."
bad,It wasn’t too bad  people were nice  customers are usually nice and less you didn’t give them what they wanted  like  if something they liked in the warmer wasn’t there they blame you  A lot of times it was super busy so you couldn’t put anything in there anyways
bad,supper rush was intense and very busy at times. I worked overnights preparing donuts and other pastries as well. the overnights were calm and quiet. the younger workers didn't like doing their job which put more on my list of duties
bad,This was a good job until I was pushed to me Assistant Manager. Then I had to work so many hours to cover everyone that called in that I had no life..
bad,Hired in eith great aspirations. Wanted to learn as much as possible. Manager picked favorites. The rest were pushed to the side. Prepare to pucker up if want to get anywhere in this store.
bad,"Management is usually poor at many stores and they keep replacing bad managers with more bad ones. There's not a lot of structure and employees usually just do whatever and get in trouble later for not knowing what to do. There's no benefits if you are part time, and when I was full time I never got any benefits or paperwork for it. Not a great place to work."
bad,Didn't get a lot of hours. It was quick paced and slot if the crew member were rude. It seemed as if I only worked when the needed me instead of having a set schedule.
bad,"It was usually steady, some days busier then others. I learned how to make pizzas, use a register. Management was unfair with scheduling and positions. My coworkers made it all worth it! overall the hardest part was trying to stay caught up on busy days."
bad,"The only Employees that get vacations is upper management, all other Employees deemed as part time & work FT hours then they want to threaten your job, if your only able to work certain hrs due to personal reasons, who does this? this is wrong! if they like your work & you work when they need you they should be able to accommodate your needs of hours. your work hours are all over the place."
bad,"It is a nice place to work at but the store I particularly worked at, the general manager got involved personally with employees and other management and would terminate people due to personal issues. Other than that it was a great place to work and the customers were amazing and my co workers were even better!"
bad,"In my experience, it pretty much boils down to whether or not you are on a friendly basis with the Manager at the time.  If there are employees who do seem to be friendly with the manager, you can count on the manager playing favoritism to those employees and giving those friendy employees all of the promotions whether that person is actually performing required duties of the job or not!"
bad,"Employees are afraid of management.  They are even afraid to order food into the office for fear of getting into trouble.  Because Casey's sells pizza and donuts, the employees are often unsure of what will be okay to bring into the office.  It's a sick mind game."
bad,"low pay, few hours, unhelpful coworkers, annoying customers, and a poor training program all lead to an extremely unsatisfactory job experience. that and people can steal gas fairly easily which gets blamed on the cashier."
bad,To be honest working here was like working at a high school. Everyone acted childish. You couldn't talk to the manager without every one else knowing what you talked to them about. It was filled with nothing but drama.
bad,"I disliked the negative culture that had developed at Casey's and I was doing very base-level job descriptions for the skills I have to offer. I could not stand being bored, so I found another job that would challenge and encourage me to grow as a person."
bad,ok for a temporary job and extra spending money nothing i want to keep as a permenant job....managment leaves a lot to be desired depending on what store you work at.
bad,"Running the cash register all day with a constant line of people waiting. A lot of chores to do in your ""down time"" which never happened. Closing the store with no one to back you up when you go out and do your ""chores"" made it hard to be in two places at once."
bad,Communication is very horrible customer service skills are horrible there should be a new store manager for this place she sleeps around with her customers while on the job and she takes her anger out on all of her employees
bad,I get no set days.  Time off for family is non existent.  No one works as a team so part of the people kill themselves while the chosen ones do as little as they like.  Very frustrating
bad,"everyone always talked about everyone, including management. The environment was not worker friendly and if you wanted to advance, you better have it in with your supervisor. If you're hired on part time, you will get told there is a 20 hour a week position and then get scheduled for 24 hours/bi weekly. Its good for a high school kid but not for an adult."
bad,"not recommended....a lot of drama from co workers and management "
bad,"Casey's is overall a fun place to work. I actually like the job, but management is a big problem there because they try to enforce the company policies to everyone else, but they themselves, are not following them I don't have a single problem following company policies, but if they are going to be enforced to me, they need to be enforced for everyone that works within the company."
bad,I am very hard working and speak two languages I am always early and always come in and work when I am called I also complete all tasks
bad,"I worked for them on Halloween, thanksgiving, Christmas eve, Christmas day, new years eve, new years day, Easter, and graduation day. I was working ""part-time"" 39 hours a week. No body followed the rules, serious claims were ignored, and no body was reliable. The management had no idea what they were doing and didn't want any help from others. I had to step up (as a 22 year old) and fix the schedules"
bad,"The work place is clean, but the staff didn't do their job correctly. I worked very hard at my job. Nothing ever got stocked unless me and the managers did anything,"
bad,"I was a cashier here and it was an alright job, I didn't learn anything I didn't know already because I had worked at jobs like these before. Management would not work with me to get me more hours when I repeatedly asked, (I lived 20 miles from the station and I was barely working 20 hours a week and couldn't afford the gas). My Team and I always did an outstanding job, our tasks were minuscule and were done very early into the night. The hardest part of the job was not being able to have management work with me and get me the hours i knew i needed and deserved with as hard as i worked for them. I cannot recall any enjoyable moments working here. I had to deal with a lot of drunk and disorderly people working the night shift and sometimes it got scary!"
bad,"This was not the worst job I've ever had, but it definitely was not the best."
bad,"I find working at Casey's to be like working with a group of teenagers. The manager at my local Casey's has childlike behavior in that she throws things across the store in 'play' with the other employees and assistant managers, I find this behavior to be very unbecoming of a store manager and am embarrassed that I work for such a person. She fails to resolve conflict between the shifts, does not take appropriate action for unacceptable behavior and performances, she is to worried about being friends with her teenage employees. She also exhibits very inappropriate behavior with male employees and customers."
bad,the company its self was ok to work for the manager on the other hand was inexperienced and did not and does not manage the store well. he shows favortism and has no fairness.
bad,Employees would steal. Management never did anything about it. 
bad,I loved working with co-workers and the public. I learned how to run their system and doing bookwork. The hardest part of this position was dealing with a brand new store manager.
bad,"i enjoyed working with some of the other employees, but management needs work! the drama and favoritism there was very unbearable. this store lost many key employees due to treatment by the manager."
bad,"Most days are an early start with everything from paperwork to customer service. Days tend to be long and absolutely no breaks are given for managers or employees. There is a huge amount of responsibility with little compensation, benefit or thanks from upper management. Experience with upper management suggests that the only motivational skills they have is to be abrasive and abusive toward employyees and brow beat them until their self worth and self esteem are at their lowest. I can only liken this to any other abusive relationship that allows them to believe that they would never be hired or able to find another job that would take them. It causes most managers to have a difficult time with morale and good customer service from the employees. Customers are always the most enjoyable part of the job along with some very good employees who know their value and self worth and do not let the rantings of a few cause them to question themselves."
bad,Clock in
bad,"It was on ok job to work for. Liked most of the co-workers in which I worked with. Learned how to do the books, check in vendors, and do inventory."
bad,"Management was terrible, employees are rude and harass people they don't like. Management did nothing when a problem was brought to them. The store was a disaster."
bad,District manager 10/10 is unpleasant. Hours are up and down. Pay is horrible. Don't even think about getting sick or calling in for sick child. Don't do it
bad,"When it comes to work I feel very unappreciated by my bosses. People will go above and beyond what they should and still can't even get a thank you they are quick with the write ups if you make any mistakes but if a manager has to work a shift they don't want  to and do something wrong nothing happens. I want to be valued because without us ""little guys"" the store couldn't run."
bad,"Employees are usually locals of the area who are not motivated to either come in on time, work hard, or work together. Manager is bogged down with customer complaints often preventing them from supporting employee team and many things go undone."
bad,While i was with my first manager i had a great time at work everyday. but after he was let go for dumb reasons the current manager and regional manager ruined the work environment and drove customers away.
bad,"Long hours, lots of standing and walking. Often left having to clean up after fellow employees and pick up their slack. There are no breaks and no chances of moving up unless a boss quits, which seems unlikely at best. Be wary to never have a day off again, be called in at all hours of the day, and being stuck having to work multiple shifts, because no one wants to show up for this job."
bad,"-Depending on the shift, duties included cleaning, food preparation, stocking, and cashier work."
bad,I love my customers and I love my job but I cant make a living with the hours I got cut down to. I'm highly upset with the way ive been treated. They exspect me to do my job and others on the night shift and no one on day shift wants to clean the kitchen. Trash doesnt get taken out like its suppose to be
bad,"The store manager has grandfathered herself into her position in a small town. She bullies employees and basically dares them into quitting, unless they are her friends."
bad,"Current management is horrible, she is not management material. Assistant managers have to pick up the slack for store manager. Regional manager babies store manager. There is much drama associated with working in a convenience store, but to add management into that mix is unacceptable. I would not recommend working for Casey's."
bad,"I've worked at three different stores and have had different experiences at all of them. Usually the issues go back to poor management, greedy/lack of understanding from corporate, bad scheduling, poor hiring process, poor pay. You can get hired for one job and be stuck doing duties outside your job. This wouldn't be an issue if you were compensated for it."
bad,"Turnover is high, the hours sometimes suck, food waste is absolutely terrible, they keep taking away perks for working there. Raises are too low. Managers have favorites or dont take care of problems or problem workers."
bad,"I worked at Casey's for 19 years. Upper management and the corporate executives do not support or care about its store staff, both its management and regular workers. There are no scheduled breaks. They do not fully close on any holiday.They do not close in dangerous weather conditions. Turnover rate is high due to employee frustration and dissatisfaction."
bad,"Have worked at my Casey's for 7 years. A year in, everyone including new hires went from $8 hourly to $11 hourly which was nice, but 6 years later I'm only making $11.75. Management has begun cutting hours, and I have gone from 40 hours a week to 45 bi-weekly. No room for growth, you can train to be a manager, but that will get you $13 to jump a lot of hoops."
bad,"The company may be famous for pizza, but the staff is famous for delegating out their tasks. Certain shifts have requirements and tasks that are forced upon them because other people have "" a lot to do"" All in all the work itself is simple, its just the employees not stepping up make sure their job is complete"
bad,the work was hard the pay was alright but the GM at the time left something to be liked always pushy and rude and was not kind to people that were sick.  The other management staff were cool.
bad,Casey’s is growing to fast and not able to keep up with hiring qualified employees. They’ll hire anyone that basically walks thru the door. I understand being short handed yet if they don’t try and keep there good employees with minimal wage increase they’ll never be the go to convenience store
bad,"Despite my low review I DID actually enjoy the work at Casey's. It was fast and easy and the rushes made the day go quick. However, management left a lot to be desired. I often was called in to cover the donuts shift and would then have to cover someone's day shift (so I would work 12 hours a day despite them refusing to ""bump"" me from part time). This happened at least once a week, but upwards to four times a week when the SAME people would call out. I came in early or stayed late to train the managers on donuts or teach them how to clean the machines. I would be called on my days off to see if I could give a fellow employee a ride to work and had even been sent from work to pick someone up to make it to their shift. I'd be called in on my days off to work the deliveries. My district manager and I butted heads a lot. (Our store managers had a high turn over rate and the DM was in a lot more during periods where there was no store manager.) Over things like me wearing a sweater during winter months (the handbook literally said employees could wear white, red, or black sweaters during winter and she said, ""Well, I don't think that's what it meant.""), me refusing to make and serve pizza with spoiled dough (we had customer complaints, she tasted it and agreed that it was bad and when the customer left told me to use the bucket, anyway. I threw it away and told her I couldn't do that.), me refusing to stand beside the dryer and cleaning supplies to eat my lunch (I was told if I wanted to take it outside after purchase I had to pay full price and did so for the rest of my time there)."
bad,"There is a “termination culture” in this company: The minute they hire you, they begin looking for a reason to fire you. A district manager fired one employee for picking up a piece of trash in the parking lot and throwing it in the trashcan on her way into the store one day because she “worked off the clock”. Another employee was fired for going to the back room and putting on her smock before she clocked in - again it was deemed “working off the clock”.  This company is also sexist towards men managers.  The ratio of women to men store managers in the two districts I was familiar with was 10 to 1. The district manager NEVER had anything positive or nice to say when she visited. She micromanaged my store including personnel decisions.  District managers would literally spend 40+ hours a week in stores watching security video looking for reasons to terminate employees.  Casey’s significantly increased store manager pay a few years ago and they STILL go through as many as 3-4 store managers a year in many of their SE Kansas and NE Oklahoma stores. If you’re interested in a convenience store job, go apply at QuikTrip."
bad,"Casey's General Store is a decent job, but they have terrible management. But for a typical day at Casey's consisted of running the register and helping customers with their transactions and making sure the store is nice and clean and easy to find things."
bad,"Very poor management at the manteno location specifically. The job was very easy, and the employees were very nice, but the management team was just far from good."
bad,You were hired as part time but worked more and no benifits for part time employees. A lot to do and not all employees did their share of the work load . i did enjoy the interacting with customers daily. Always wanted to learn new areas and help with anything.
bad,"Never enough help in the kitchen. Corporate constantly cuts hours resulting in overworked employees. I dont know how they expect a kitchen to push out 70-100 pizzas on a Friday night with only two sometimes one employee in the kitchen. Not to mention the one cashier dealing with 10-20 people in the store at a time. Was also very poorly managed. Manager would leave hours before their shift was scheduled to end and refused to help cover employee shifts under any circumstances. ""I dont get paid enough to deal with this."" Their exact words."
bad,I feel that Caseys does not offer a good work life balance. Management is only out for self and no real training is completed inside of the stores. Do not recommend
bad,"Worked for this company for 6 long years, had one illness and missed a day of work and was fired the next day!!! Also they fired my son who was also employed simply because they were firing me!!"
bad,"They work you hard, and don't take in consideration people's lives. The shift is unorthodox and the breaks they give contradict the work schedule. Thus shows they are incompetent"
bad,It's easy work. It a stressful place. Things change so quickly. Raises arnt given as they should be. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone after my experience.
bad,"People worked good together"
bad,"High stress,management has no clue.turn over is weekly.A lot of misinformation is passed on.No way does the manager work 40 hours a week."
bad,I loved case in the beginng before I got transfered then it all went down hill mangers didn't do her a job at all other then that loved my job there I had a very good experience  for a first job
bad,"I did not like working there. I was harassed and they did nothing about it. The people were rude, I was made fun of and left to work with someone I said I wouldn't want to work with."
bad,"I learned from this company that they push off all the blame on the Assistant manager, even if it wasn't their fault. The main manager was always taking off, even when it was her work weekend. I would work here again but no I would never take a shift leader position nor management position. I am a firm believer that your crew is only as good as what their team leader is. I was young and I learned to much from this job. I have carried this learning experience from this job ever since, and am extremely grateful that I was given the opportunity to work along some amazing people"
bad,The management was not the greatest. They didnt treat new employees like they should have. They changed the schedule around on the new employees. They make you work second shift one day and then expect you back for first shift the next day.
bad,"It was not a positive energy within the store. There was no store manager, only an assistant manager. Workers were constantly arguing through out their shifts."
bad,"judge by gossip, poor customer service, never praise but always down grade people and employees."
bad,"I get that its a cashier job, but every other retail place I've been has treated me better then Casey's. Higher pay, benefits, basic food, while with Casey I can't afford to live, with cut hours, no benefits and free drinks, which happen to not include the basic of water. So if you don't want to drink Soda, tough luck."
bad,Various work hours schedule changed by manager without letting employees know approved time off requests then after approved day off fire employee who were extremely dependable who worked hard working 6 days per week including doing double shifts competitive pay but extremely poor change in store management who seems to lack appreciation in their employees
bad,Very fast paced and stressful environment. Somewhat demanding management and other employees. Too much work load for one employee to complete in one work shift
bad,"Not a bad job to pass the time. pay is poor chance for advancement poor, management poor. medium to fast paced job. so this is more for  part time help get you through school or something."
bad,I loved my job but had to part ways with the manager. I was tired of the high school drama from a bunch of grown adults. Overall Casey's is a great place to work as long as the store manager does their job.
bad,Seeing the regular customers everyday was nice at times. Too much small town gossip and pointless drama. Food was good when decent people were working.
bad,Most customers are rude. Manager is rude and disrespectful to some employees. Will take advantage of employees. Does whatever she wants. Rude to customers. If you call out of work you get interrogated. Employees are rude and careless. Employees treat each other with little respect. Manager talks bad about employees and customers with employees. When I was working there we had rats and roaches. You don't get properly trained. Cats are always hanging around. Some food gets sold that can get customers sick. Very dirty kitchen
bad,"Management picked favorites"
bad,Doesn't have good management and that causes some problems. They don't treat their employees well which then results in some poor workers. Need to have better management.
bad,"Do not go into this company expecting to move up if you simply put in the time, the only way to move up is to become their slave with your mouth shut about everything. Their policies aren't too bad but the manner and the people they choose for promotions at any level above assistant managers is very irregular and often times very unfair. The pay is not enough for the amount of work you are expected to do unless you become a store manager or higher. There are no enjoyable parts of this job except the people you work with."
bad,"managers make rouge decisions without knowledge of laws or  consequences. company will not communicate with an employee on an issue they have with a manager, they just pawn the issue off on the managers boss. from what i've seen, they get the same runaround."
bad,"go into work, keep kitchen up to par, drawer count at begging of shift, pick up excess chores and responsibility not fulfilled from prior shift workers, deposit and keep drawer at a steady number.  come in uniform everyday, stay over for call offs, stock and upkeep, tidiness and cleanliness."
bad,It was a gas station so obviously it's not suppose to be fun. I did my best. When i found a job that suited me better i left. It was alright at the time.
bad,"A very fast pased job. Definately a lot of multi tasking. Overall a friendly place to work. There was 50 to 60lb lifting requirement which was hard, but do able. Management was like big brother. A lot of drama which didn't need to be caused. I really enjoyed talking to the customers."
bad,"I would never work for Casey's General Store again, due to the fact that during a typical day at work I was constantly worried about certain things that could end up with me losing my job. Such as paying attention to gas pumps while shady and concerning customers are in the store. I couldnt pay attention to both, and in order to prevent, people stealing gas or food, I could get written up for both and fired. I learned several priorites, and tasks that it takes to run a gas station. Management was terrible and favored certain employees over others, rarely gave employees breaks unless working over 7 hours. Hardest part was being the only front of store employee, it became difficult. there was no enjoyable part of the job."
bad,Slow in mornings but would speed up real quick once store was opened. co-workers were calm and quite
bad,"customer service attending to customer, stocking shelves, cleaning counting drawer"
bad,"made a lot of pizza, stocked cooler, cleaned a lot. Learned to really multi-task. Management changed as much as employees."
bad,"Basic retail position. Learned skills in vendor relations and product ordering. Upper management was not dedicated. Coworkers were young adults looking to move on. The hardest part of the job was retaining a staff, very high turnover. Most enjoyable part of the job was free fountain drinks."
bad,"The upper management does not consult with the regular employees before making a decision."
bad,making customers and coworkers happy and pay attention to detail.
bad,It felt like i was in highschool again everyone talked about everyone and when you made the boss mad say bye bye to hours. She was probably the worst about the job the actual job itself was awesome dealing with customers everyday that were amazing and meeting new people.
bad,"While it won't be a career move for 99% of the people that work there, it's not a terrible place to go while looking for a better job."
bad,"I was responsible for not only answering phones, but also operating the cash register. This store was opened 24-hr a day which allowed me to have a flexible schedule."
bad,"It is a good place for people that like working with customers, but not very good for keeping you on a decent schedule. Work hours are all over the place."
bad,Managers do not support their staff. Schedules are put out the day before the new one starts. No regard for workers need for consistency. Workers are not treated as valued. Workers not completing job requirements are not reprimanded. Workers that are completing their job requirements are reprimanded for not cleaning up after those that don't.
bad,"The title states it all. I was only there a month, and despite having 6 years of convenience store experience they would only start me out at $8.25 per hour. The manager was clearly a drug addict since she would lock herself in the restroom for hours at a time and show up to work when you could tell she had been drinking. I am sure not all Casey's General Stores are like this, but my experience was a really bad one"
bad,"Wasteful company, no recognition for a job well done."
bad,Poor management not a very supportive company to work for serious lack of training. Serious mismanagement lack of teamwork lack of support of Anna's by other employee and management
bad,"Management is not that great so the employees do not find it necessary to try and do their best. This place is not challenging enough for me, I need a place that requires me to solve actual problems."
bad,I wouldn't recommend the Casey's I worked at. Lazy and young employees.  To much gossip and backstabbing. Employees were constantly walking off the job in the middle of their shift.
bad,They are out for themselves the most raise you can get a year is $0.25 one time a year no overtime or you will be disciplined. They do not give you breaks you are told that they don't have to. They throw out so much good food instead of giving it to salvation army the homeless and if you are caught eating a piece of the wasted out food and not paid for it you can be fired
bad,Management was looking more so for someone to fill hours and not have a life beyond work. My first store was good and the manager was kind and understanding of work life balance mostly. The second location just wanted someone to work even if they have the flu or you could crash on the way to work due to weather conditions.
bad,Management is bad hours are horrible no set schedule no chance for advancement you have no life work inconsistent hours some morning some night don't do it.
bad,"When I first started at Casey's it was really good the manager I really liked now I'm about 4 months and we got new managers and the store just went to bed. The new managers Don't Care about us, nighttime employees as much as we work as much as we do they just don't care about us all they do is sit there and talk about us and cut us down. Sadly. I work full-time hours but I don't get any benefits because they hired me as part time"
bad,"Manager showed favoratism, a employee did not EVER work weekends when everyone else work every weekend. Alot of childish backstabbing.Hard to find replacement for shift."
bad,"Typical day for working front register involved working with the till, selling lottery, cigarettes from behind the counter. Basic daily cleaning including sweeping, mopping, wiping down counters, and changing garbages. The store manager however was unclear, unconstructive, and down right rude. Rarely showing respect for employees."
bad,I was hired on by a great manager overall as well as the one that i was interviewed by. As i started at caseys it just went downhill from there. Our kitchen manager quit on us as well as some employees and the other two managers were and still are disrespectful and dont have any sympathy or care for anyone. It was kind of a everyone for themselves things and all management did was sit in the office and boss us all day and I didn’t like that.
bad,The job basically consists of maintaining a clean area and cooking and perfect hygiene wash hands often and keep everything in order and get it done in a formidable pace
bad,"At my store, the management sucks. My current coworkers are okay, but they have hired questionable people just to have bodies in the building. It is a very easy job though."
bad,"There is a higher Archy, and if your below that than your walked on, and regarded as the token ! It just sucked for the most part. Management should take a bigger role in positive enforcement, and recruitment. Also it's not the employee fault the next guy doesn't come in. Management gets paid for that! "
bad,"At the location I worked at, employees would be scheduled for 10 hours with no breaks in between. We had two registers but the second one would never be in use despite us being consistently busy."
bad,"As a store manager be prepared to log 80 hours in a week."
bad,"A typical day at work would be meeting customers and communicating on a regular basis. Typically management was full of people who either procrastinated or didn't enjoy their job. I had some fun there, however everybody was eager to get out and race made a difference in your application. Made it hard for good working people to get a job, especially when store manager made the hiring justifications"
bad,moral circling the toilet bowl. supervisors are better than you in every way including being human. not paid enough to put up with politics and favoritism.
bad,"I login to my computer check my calls for the day I check for priority calls then plan my route around what calls I think are important and need fixed first.  I travel from store to store fixing broken equipment.  Management I deal with is all from store manager to my direct supervisor and all the way up the chain.  Most manager are ok but there is alot of poor training.   My job has become harder over the years as they add more equipment, change computer systems that were easy to use to ones that are over complicated and full of bugs. I use to love getting up and going to work but over the years as things changed and micro managing crept in it just isn't anything I look forward to. I enjoy working with most of the store employee's I have become friends with over the past 8 years."
bad,It was an okay place to work. I didn't really like it. There was a lot of drama and it was a very unstable work environment. Nobody did their job correctly and the managers did not really do anything about it.
bad,I was always schedule for these crazy long shifts. It was real tiresome running a register and completing side jobs. It got old real fast. It would have been nice to been thrown in a short 7 hour day or even a 4 hour day. The store was so understaffed that I was the only cashier for most of my shifts and I didn't like that.
bad,"A typical day was very stressful and more often than not, not enough help/ manpower was provided in order to fulfill the requirements of the position. As far as the workplace goes, it was very unprofessional and personal matters were more likely to sway decisions than anything else."
bad,"I closed the store 3 nights a week and worked day shifts another 3 times a week. All daily duties are shoved onto the night shift- the longest and most sparsely staffed shift. All store managers are usually working at the same time, gossiping  outside about how lazy the minimum wage workers are."
bad,It was a good job but not something i would recommend for a parent trying to make it.They started with regard of my relationship with my son. I am aware everyone must work but also deserve a day off.
bad,"Casey's is not a good place to work if your trying to move up the ladder or get ahead in life. The hours Lucite greatly, one week you may work 40 plus hours and the next week only 15 hours,no routine or balance."
bad,"Because they have trouble keeping employees, often it was hard to get a day off. The management is hard on employees. If you ask for a day off during a time you are working because no one else will, your job could be in jeopardy. But, that is strange because who would work if you are fired?"
bad,"The location where I worked had a lot of favoritism. You could be the hardest worker there and if you bring an issue up to management having to deal with one of the managements ""friends"" it is somehow turned around on you. This job had more drama involved that any other job I have seen in my life. Certain people can get away with things the company does not allow. (Like sitting on their cellphones when there is work to do.) If you work the afternoon shift good luck-the morning shift knows they don't have to do much because if they don't get it done the afternoon shift will have to before the night is over. The location where I was cannot keep any workers. There were nights you would get 150 pizzas and there is only one person working in the kitchen making the pizzas, and one person boxing them. You NEED to be a hard worker to work in this fast pace environment. However this location could only seem to hire lazy people which is why they have none of the hard workers left. Lazy people, and the pay is unfair. My pay was correct for working there for 4 years, however before leaving me and another employee (the hardest working older lady I have ever seen in my life-who had been working there for the past 11 years and put more into the company than any other employee I worked with by a long shot) realized that I was getting paid a dollar an hour more than she was! (When the company raised their starting wage the employees that were already working there were not reimbursed the difference.)"
bad,A typical day at work was covering someone else's shift myself because no one wanted to work.  You can only work so long with no time off.  My new supervisor was unfair.  The hardest part of the job was finding people who wanted to work that were competent. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
bad,help customers and make sure everything is getting done.Make sure food is dated and put in warmers. I was kitchen manager. Had to make sure employees were doing what they are supposed to do.
bad,"Go to work, arrive, see that there are multiple jobs that were not completed by the previous shift, know that you must complete them because the manager will not have co-workers do it before they leave. Work hard, long hours, for minimum pay."
bad,"they would over hire, so i would only ever be scheduled about 4 hours a week which does not work for me. people would slack off, and not do their work leaving it all for me. management had favorites."
bad,When i worked here i was always on edge. It seemed that no matter what i did and how hard i worked they still wanted more. it finally got to the point that i couldn't take it anymore so that was it for me.
bad,Food was ok. Fast paste most of the time. Liked the discount  while we worked. Hours were ok. Got along with my coworkers.. working in the kitchen wasn't to bad.
bad,"You get 1/2 off their expensive food, up to$9.  You only get a free fountain pop or coffee, only if you have your Caseys mug, or it’s full price. I had the luxury of being part of management where I got to meet and/or talk to several people up the chain of command and after an unnamed employee retired, it turned for the worse. There is an extreme amount of hypocrisy and abuse of power, and cover ups. And if your looking for an employer that cares for there employees, Caseys is not for you."
bad,Management had too many vacation days when they should have been hiring staff.  Manager was never available for staff at the store and she spoke badly of employees.
bad,"I enjoyed working there, and the people were nice but all in all I would only recommend for a beginner job. Not a very advancement friendly area.  You have to be 18 to work in kitchen and 21 to work cashier, so I was limited to areas to work."
bad,It was a pretty solid job it. Made you build your social skills it was reallyfast paced no discount and super low pay but what can you do food was good but lacked variety
bad,Enjoyed working for this company. Did not like the district manager if she did not like you she would find fault in your work and complain to the manager all the time.
bad,"Fellow coworkers always made me smile and encouraged me to finish my day happy. The job was challenging and stressful, but easy to do. At times when issues would arise, I always took proper protocol and management wouldn't take my concerns, seriously."
bad,"Worst part of job was scheduling always subject to change based on others not showing up for work. "
bad,wasnt to bad to work for. the management was not all there but thats to be expected anywhere. the turnover rate was terrible so they are always training someone new but they do tech you the best customer service
bad,major time abuse happens by staff smoking and general lack of people caring .i was let go as a part timer after begging to be given more hours  the store was cut by 200 hour then they added a full time transfer then added  another 15 hour employee then hired a first assistant manager. leave a culture of catty women who rather complain about what everyone else is doing rather then do there own work in turn not finishing it.
bad,the manager was fake and acted to love all her employees but told everyone else their business. the customers were all regulars so everyone knew everyone and got along well.
bad,"People were very unfair, you were either a favorite or you were not liked very much there was no in between. If there was a real reason on why you could not make it into work that day they did not care, no matter what kind of state you are in they would force you to go to work or you got fired."
bad,The job was difficult to be successful at due to the lack of work ethic the other employees had at the store.  Many times i was struggling to get through the day and satisfy customer needs because there was no support or help from other employees
bad,Worked every weekend and holiday on the closing shift which I got used to. Worked 6 out of 7 days/wk. which was also ok. It was only when I requested 5 days off for vacation time to visit family in Colorado and was denied that it became too much.
bad,They work you to hard for the money even though it's a decent pay its not enough for everything that you go through throughout the day. They should hire people right out of prison.
bad,"The organization is poorly ran,  The area supervisor and district manager in my area was very week and only looking to cover their jobs.  I would only recommend this organization as a last resort. The job of a store manager for Caseys is simple and easy to do."
bad,"Training and communication is very weak at the store I work at. Manager will not inform that you did anything wrong until it's too late. Manager in particular couldn't keep any subordinates below her due to her treatment of them for the majority of my tenure, which lead to people not know expectations and with such low involvement from management it can quickly become a nightmare. Also prefers to blame issues on employees than fixing the issue. Have watched 40+ come and go in 3 years, with a small 12 person crew, most leaving due to frustration at management."
bad,What I learned is how to deal with the general public. Management was not the best and was always having to train new employees that at the most lasted 1 week. You could not count on getting off at the end of shift being employees would not show up for work.
bad,I was fired because he looked at the wrong day on my schedule and replaced me with a new employee. I felt as if I was being treated unfair due to his mess up.
bad,"Pay was low, hours where hard to cover if needed time off. Mangement could been little nicer, but all in all it was a good place for a first time job for someone eles"
bad,Low pay but the employees seem to enjoy each others company. It's not a place to make a career but for those fresh out of school and new to working it's a good first
bad,caseys is a great place to work you meet new people everyday but the hours suck. the manager and co workers were good to get along with but you never got off at the right time.
bad,"This Casey's is sad.....Cliques and unfair practices....If you were a smoker you got more breaks.If someone decided to do a drive off,you"
bad,The store is expected to be very clean and tidy. They have strict rules on there food which is comforting to know. They offer great customer service. They have a well ran system for getting in maximum profit.
bad,"Management sucked"
bad,Manager wasn't the greatest but the coworkers were amazing. Running the cash register and cooking food was a blast with the right people and customers were just as great
bad,"This was just a job, and that was ok. This place was honestly stupid. And I have nothing good to say about it at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;........"
bad,Working for this company is average if you find a store with a good manager it can be a great place to work but they seem to be few in numbers.
bad,"I loved making pizzas but did not like the management. I made pizzas, cleaned the work station prepped for morning shift. I had also prepped and made subs."
bad,"Come in and things are suppose to be prepped but in this store they usually didnt. I would start by prepping my workday and getting all the required material for the night ready. and while we are making our pizzas we also have to prep the next shift, and day. and then we would clean for the night and clock out."
bad,"I have worked every shift at Casey's, i got along with a few people I worked with there, hardest part of the job was staying awake all night, the most enjoyable part of working for Casey's was learning how to make pizza and donuts."
bad,I really liked working with the public and meeting new people.  It was a fun atmosphere to be in.  I would like to work for a Casey's again.
bad,"A typical day at Caseys was repeated steps with cooking pizzas greeting and meeting the same customers that came in each day before work. I had nice co-workers and good management, really enjoyed meeting customers but standing as a cashier for eight to ten hour got to me by the end of the day"
bad,"The general managers are not approachable, even by asst. managers.  When approached about theft (the general manager stealing) she threatened the asst. manager.  When the asst. manager went to corporate about this they imidiately informed the Gen. manager and only offered to relocate the asst. manager (myself).  I could no longer work for a company that would knowingly allow this behavior to occur."
bad,"Most of my days spent at this company were made up of making pizzas and other foods. I also would run the cash register from time to time when someone was needed. "
bad,"enjoyed getting to know people,working late hours,general cleaning and stocking products,and making sure everything was ordered and received on time."
bad,"The company is a great one to work for the management could of been trained more the hardest part of the job was working with unhappy customers, co-workers was always helpful and willing to work as a team. the most enjoyable part of the job was working as much as you wanted."
bad,"prep work, unload truck, interact with customers, make sure warmers are full, clean kitchen , stock ice , pop, beer cooler, clean ovens,"
bad,"A typical day at Casey's General Store has air that is full of negative energy from other employees.  What I learned was how to use a doughnut machine, proper phone etiquette and about gas pumps, gas lines and drive-offs, and local law enforcement techniques. The hardest part of the job was honestly dealing with management, as they were very selfish and narrow minded.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and the 3 a.m. morning doughnut shift."
bad,They let anyone be a manager. They will make you do more than what your job description is. The pay sucks for the amount of work that is done.
bad,"The job itself isn't hard, you just have to put up with a lot of childish and stupid things that you don't get paid enough to deal with."
bad,"I was employed at Caseys general store a total of 3 years and 9 month. I thoroughly enjoyed working with my coworkers. I feel totally confident in stating i was the best customer service oriented cashier my manager had. I was there every day, very dependable and reliable. I would have to have to say the most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with my customers on an everyday basis"
bad,I found this job to be very knowledgeable of learning the trade of assistant manager. I enjoy working with the public and also in a team work environment. The job security is very poor and the recognition of doing a very good job is also disappointing. The supervisor was one of the most enjoyable people I have ever worked for and also extremely knowledgeable of the running of the store. A typical day passes quickly with much to do to keep a fine tune business running.
bad,"Had trouble getting my raise took them 2 months to get me a raise when I became an Assistant Manager. Then another 3 to give me back pay for those 2 months. Which I had to fight them for! Then I worked 50+ hours a week for the 5 months I was an Assistant Manager. They were poorly staffed, very poorly trained, and pay was very low for the amount of work I did. I would not recommend this job to anyone for the fact that they will try to cheat you every time they can."
bad,"Current management is sub-par. The job itself was enjoyable (making pizza, for the most part.) Nevertheless, the general lack of professionalism, consistency, and stability turned out to be more than this worker could stomach."
bad,"Like to work with the public and with other employee's. I learned to do paper work, run register, computer, and stocked shelves. When the manager was there that trained me was still there the store ran very smooth but when the new manager came in she started to fire people because they were trained wrong."
bad,"Taking care of my customers in a timely manner to keep them satisfied as much as possible and helping them in any possible way I can, is my typical day at work. I have learned that customers always come first they are always right. Management at Caseys is very poor. My co-workers are not fun to work with, when one calls you every name in the book during work hours and does not get a write up or anything then it is my time to get a new and better job. The hardest part of my job is cleaning the whole store alone and having to keep an eye on the front to take care of customers as well, so it is hard to get out of work on time because all is done by one person alone. The most enjoyable part of my day at work is my customers, I have regulars that come in just to say hi to me and ask about me when I'm not there, they are the only ones that make it hard to leave."
bad,"I am a full time mom with a child that has medical problems and the 10 till 2 shift worked out great with my son in school. i would go to work after he went to school and I was off before he was out of school. The cooking was easy, they provide books telling you everything you need to know about each food you cook, like how long to cook it at waht temp. I enjoyed making pizza. It was fun and its my fave food so it was really cool."
bad,can be very fast paced must be able to multi task and be willing to come in at anytime
bad,The store manager bullied and intimidated me and other staff. She talked down to me and other staff when she was upset about anything. She did not set reasonable expectations.
bad,"at the time there was not a strong manager so there was a lot of drama, seems to have a better manager now though.  the hours were very inconsistent and hard to know what you were working day to day"
bad,Store manager refused to listen to assistant manager about potential shoplifters. Would not report or show video to law enforcement. Obviously there is something wrong going on in the store
bad,Not a bad place to start if you haven't. I only worked there for a year and didn't leave on a good note but my experiences will be different than yours.
bad,"Upper management places unreasonable expectations on store managers. They daily pile on so much unnecessary stress with added duties for the manager that he/she has no time to manage the day to day operations, then place blame when they are unable to be completed. Daily emails from district manager threatening job security, and "" extra hours"" if unnecessary expectations aren't met."
bad,Of the time I spent working there I never once felt like an employee but a slave. The work was not easy and no one was nice. I felt like everyone had a negative attitude and like I was alone the whole work day.
bad,"The best way to describe the manager is a guilt tripping, wet noodle. There's a high amount of favoritism to the older staff. It doesn't matter if they're incorrectly making food or not washing dishes, but as soon as I don't have a name tag on he brings out passive aggressive jokes about firing me. Great priorities."
bad,Not a good place to work manager was rude didnt do her job but made everyone else do her job had her favorites and defentaly showed it with no hesitation and was not organized
bad,"The job itself is not difficult at all, and the pay is good for someone with no experience even working part time.  Very few employees are offered full time hours other than managers, and they have no problem changing your schedule significantly the day the schedule starts, weeks after it was posted, well after you've already made plans outside of work around that schedule.  If you don't have regularly scheduled social events, this could be a great fit."
bad,policies where good. it was a new store but the people at my location made things difficult to stayalways talking bad and playing manipulating games not all caseys are bad however this one was not for me. the work is easy pay was not bad.
bad,Started  with High hopes ended  in disappointment ! Nothing was as promised !  Lack of concern ! Corporate is only after money doesn’t care about employees
bad,"district manager and supervisor have unrealistic expectations of employees, when help is needed generally unable to contact supervisors or corp. office and were then blamed for any problems occurred"
bad,Working at Caseys was always stressful and never felt like a friendly experience. The manager was always pushing for everyone to do more and as the kitchen manager a lot of tasks are pushed on you instead of working with the store manager to complete things. The manager would often yell and demean you if you couldn't show up on time or had to get time off and if you were thinking of quiting he would question you. The hardest part of the job was never knowing if I could trust anyone because the manager would ask people about all your personal issues so he could interrogate you and know if you are specifically trying to leave. Best part was my teammates the few who were good people.
bad,"Non-flexible hours, bad management, no benefits part time, didn’t schedule me for 3 weeks with no explanation. Other workers were nice and did not enjoy the manager."
bad,"Beginning on my first day, the Manager that hired me was fired. A new Management team was brought into the store, however, they appeared more concerned with cleaning house, by eliminating any of the prior employees and replacing them with a new crew. "
bad,Not a huge fan of some of the people that work with this company or come into the storethere was slot of drama and slot of complaining and stressfully activity.
bad,"There is a lot of  turnover.  Management not well trained, not receptive to input from employees. The company does not seem to care to update  your file with ""full time"" status meaning you cannot work toward vacation and sick leave.  Several people, myself included, found this to be true."
bad,They can work you to death especially when no one wants to come in.  Most managers and supervisors only care about themselves and are in it for the group.
bad,Management only wants to grow their career and will walk on anyone who gets in the way. Rules change depending on which manager is there and can get you in trouble.
bad,"people was always blaming other people for the mistake and wouldn't take responsibility for there own actions, they played favoritism with their employees hardest part was not being a suck up and play childish games to get what i wanted like everyone else so i got bad hours enjoyable part was got to be sociable and got to interact with the customers"
bad,"I did advance with this company.  I began my career as a donut cook and within 2 years I became store manager.  I enjoyed the social.  This company is a very demanding line of work, but doesn't match to the pay that is given.  I would suggest a pay increase across the board."
bad,"This was the hardest job of my life. I worked day in and day out for this company. I never stopped getting phone calls and even had to take my baby in with me to make deposits. (which was made every day, by myself)"
bad,"Upper management likes to pick and choose which policies to enforce on which employees.  While I worked there, I saw several employees get away with doing things that they were not supposed to be doing, time and time again, while other employees were written up and/or fired for doing those same things."
bad,I would not work for them again. They do not treat everyone as equals. One person does all the work while others stand around and talk. Employees do not do their part of the cleaning duties. Managers do not keep up with their job and their work gets put off on the other employees.
bad,"Very under-compensated as an assistant manager for the work load I am required to take. I have a ""full-time"" position but I never work 40 hrs. a week. Hard to make ends meet with these conditions."
bad,"It paid more than most gas station jobs but the management never held some of the younger employees accountable. In fact, the management staff were acting in such a manner that the others were just following suit."
bad,The food is good but they were always short on staff. People always called off or quit after a month. The maim manager is all about herself and no one else. They refuse to enter the kitchen. The manager also does not go off people's availability.
bad,The time working at Casey's the management was poor. The store I worked at has a high turnover rate. The environment and other employees are nice. The atmosphere is good and it can be pretty flexible with your schedule.
bad,The management is really picky about who they like and dislike so basically unless your their best friend . Good luck . I worked really hard for them an was treated unfairly.
bad,"Management can be best described as passive aggressive. You never really know where you stand. Mostly you find out on review day when it's too late"
bad,Working the overnights is mostly laid back as far as the work that needs performed. The management at my store is very lacking as far as discipline towards employees that do not perform their job or call in on a regular basis.
bad,Most days go very smooth. Employees work well together and help each other out. Management could be a little more personal at work. There's really nothing to difficult about the job except the occasions when your unusually  busy.
bad,"welcoming people into the store, learning how to make specific loto tickets, management was okay, welcoming workplace hardest part of the job was trying to clean coffees and tea urns wall people came in, the most enjoyable part of the job was making new friends with customers."
bad,"Long hours picking up slack, no breaks i didn't get everything done by 1130 a lot of the time. I loved the customers not all of them cause of complaints so people can just get a free pizza"
bad,Coworkers didn't want to work with each other. Managers didn't help resolve this issue. Managers told employee too much information they shouldn't have told. Managers were upset with everything considering leaving for another job. Not enough hours to be close to poverty level.
bad,I loved working with the customers at Casey's. But my management was awful!!!. Sat in her office all day and played on her phone.Watching utube isn't what I call manager duties.
bad,Almost everything i was taught by everyone except the one coworker would start with were not supposed to do this but...  boss was not understanding of circumstances at all.
bad,I wouldn't recommend anybody to work for this company. Very easy job but its seems like corporate has a huge problem with hiring competent management. They seem to be lacking very bask managerial skills
bad,"the job was fine. I really don't have much more to say than that, except maybe someone should discuss personal hygiene and competency with the store manager."
bad,good customer service and overall gooG staff but not a great job to stay at. Alot of store drama and therefor high turnover rate. Management sometimes does not respect the ideas of all employees
bad,The stores I worked at were fine but if the district didn't like you she found a way to fire you but was underhanded about it. Blamed one girl for stealing. Said girl emptied her pockets and purse to prove she didn't steal. I offered to help with baking donuts after a one day training and was fired after second day of new schedule.
bad,"When i first started it was a great place to work, i loved my coworkers, my boss and the customers. I learned that you cant count on someone to so something you ask them to do because they will more than likely not do it because they are too worried about their own stuff or just dont want to do it. The hardest part of the job was going into work and having to do everything because the person before me decided to not finish their work. another thing i didnt like was that I was hired part-time and worked full-time hours for about 3 months without getting any of the benefits or pay."
bad,Management was lacking in all requirements which made the job more stressful for everyone under management other Caseys do not run that way I wouldn't mind working at a different location but won't go back to that one.
bad,I enjoy the job and working with my co-workers. I have pretty much done convience store work for many years and I enjoy working with people but the management is not very friendly at all very rude at times and shoudn't be yelling at the employees the way she does.
bad,Employees were great. High overturn rate. Depending on management it was ok. Hardest part was trying to spend time with kids when I was the only one someone could get a hold of when something went wrong at store.
bad,"You wake up a t 4:00 am if not earlier to be there by 5:00 am, walk into work to find several things that didn't get finished by your evening shift.  At about 5:30 - 6:00 am you get to start working on your bookkeeping/ try to keep lines down on the register as well, because the formula Casey's uses for budget hours uses Store Managers as an ""additional help"" throughout the day, which means that the Store Manager has a set list of tasks that are required to be finished by the end of the day and some of which have to be completed by a set time during your usual scheduled ""9 hour"" shift, but the catch is that you have to juggle being interrupted about every 20 - 30 mins by either a customer with a question/complaint/ ""just to say hello"" or an employee with some sort of random issue.  The turn over rate was absolutely ridiculous due to low wages and zero help from upper management to train new hires and cover shifts, (which is part of their job description), so you end up with new hires trying to train new hires sometimes because you're constantly trying to find help.  Anyways....My overall exp. was not the best in the five years I spent there and the constant issue was that Casey's demands more than you can muster in the set amount of time they give you, unless you get that random day where nothing goes wrong all day.  My family is happy I no longer work with them and I am too.  I will miss my customers and many of my employees though."
bad,It is great learning experience with customer and peole skills
bad,"I remember this job as cold, i would sit at the computer and perform sales online for clothing, handbags etc. i worked alone, the most enjoyable part of this job was my break."
bad,"A typical day of work , clocking in at 8pm and cleaning store, helping with customers.my co-workers made it fun to work with.The hardest part of the job was the 10 hours i was given each week after being promised to advance."
bad,management takes advantage of their employees by not taking responsibility for their own actions. cant leave their problems at home.
bad,training was little to nothing.did the jobs no one else wanted and did't see any advancement. troublesome employees were allowed  to continue without any worry
bad,"It's a busy place to work, but it is a mostly open schedule allowing that there is staff to work there. The tasks at hand are pretty easy to do and can be done mostly early on in the shift, if both wanted to do them."
bad,"Some days were better than others, there was alot of favoritism in the work place. If you went above and beyond what was expected management would never recognize you for it."
bad,"Overall, working for Casey's probably isn't so bad, but at the location I work at, they have a bad habit of keeping us desperately understaffed for the amount of customers we have to deal with. Also, corporate has a tendency to mandate changes that make the job even more difficult on a pretty regular basis."
bad,You can say no to a call in but they'll keep calling. Also Management only seems to care about themselves and not their employees so be ready for that.
bad,Working there was very stressful and hours would be changed without any notice. Overall the management was very bad. One manager would throw things at other workers and would come in drunk sometimes.
bad,The Casey's General Store I worked at had a problem keeping workers.  The manager never had anything positive to say and always looked at the negative. I have a customer call the store to tell the manager what a great job I did helping him out.  I never heard from the manager concerning this issue.
bad,It's not a terrible job. Not much of a people person. Dont get that many hours. Not a whole lot of room for advancement opportunity. Would be an okay job for a college student.
bad,"The pay isn't great and HR issues are not handled well. I've been harassed by every level of management and expectations were frequently unreasonable. Stagnant staffing, little to no actual action is taken to discipline ineffective employees beyond near-constant verbal assault, ensuring that most work and criticism falls on employees who might otherwise be considered an asset."
bad,"The employees can work or not depending on if they want to.  There are no consequences for not doing your job.  The manager and employees used profanity quite often in hearing of customers.  Some of the employees were suspicious in their actions while at work:  possible use of drugs, taking merchandise, etc.  Not encouraging or supportive at all."
bad,"When I first started working at Casey's I really enjoyed it and had a lot of fun. After almost a year, the manager started playing favorites and picking and choosing which employees were allowed to do certain things. Rules were constantly changing. I had no idea what to expect day by day as far as rules go. Management has zero compassion for employees. A co-workers husband was diagnosed with cancer and was going through treatment and she needed time off. The manager said she needed to learn how to separate her personal life from her work life and figure out how to make her schedule work. Do NOT call in to work for any reason at all. The manager will throw a fit and act like you are a complete inconvenience to her and get an attitude with you. She refuses to work even 1 minute past her scheduled time so if someone doesn't show up for their shift YOU have to figure out what to do (what managers get paid to do). Very poor management all the way around. In a 2 month period (since the current manager took over) 8 employees have either been terminated or walked out because of conflicts with the manager."
bad,The job was stressful and intense. Communication was not strong at those company. People were told different things to do from all the different bosses.
bad,they expect too much and wont give any help or hours to do job they require they keep cutting hours area supervisors are spread to thin with new store always opening most suoervisors have over 11 stores
bad,The overall experience was definitely sullied by the poor management of hours and personal action management. Aside from that I found the fast paced environment invigorating and the customers engaging
bad,Flexible hours when there is enough workers. But poor management continues to chase decent workers away. I've learned how to handle long hours along with customers. And have taken the 1st Assistant position after the previous one quit.
bad,Everyone worked well as a team at this location. Most employees were part time working up to 30 hours a week. They had to work a combination of cashier up front and in the back kitchen area. Shifts were not usually set hours. They range from early morning to night.
bad,"The job itself is not hard or complicated.  You see different people everyday, you have your 'usual' customers. Cleaning the store and stocking the inventory was not an issue either.  What makes the job hard is constant gossiping among the employees.  Closed minds.  And as human nature is, there is always the favorite employee who can break every rule and never be disciplined."
bad,"Hours were long and taxing, especially on those with pre-existing medical conditions. Management treats all employees like children and talks down to them. The location can't keep empoyees because of management so there is constant 10 hour shifts for almost everyone in the store. Six to seven day work weeks for most of us right now because of how under staffed we are."
bad,"Store managers tend to be lazy and not help in any work, very cutthroat or backstab tendencies. Multiple times where you;ll work 16+ hour days and then be scheduled for another 10+ hour shift only 3-5 hours later."
bad,"You'll work anywhere from 8-16 hour shifts, on your feet, with breaks only at the customer's convenience. You can expect your break to end the second someone pulls up. The shifts are long, the pay is low, it's impossible trying to even just trade shifts with people even in the case of an emergency, and the clientele is incredibly unfavorable."
bad,when working at caseys you will be required to be in 3 places at once. there are times that it is very fast paced and times that it is very slow. there is always something to clean and do.
bad,"Its a fast paced job, must enjoy working with the public and be able to keep up with telephone orders and keeping everything stocked can be a daunting task"
bad,"Very high paced and stressful environment, especially when coupled with incompetent management. It was a temporary job, but I was glad when i could leave."
bad,"Just get your job done don't be tardy and everything should go smoothly. There are no breaks and your on your feet for your while shift. Some of rye co-worker were rude,  some of management was rude and unprofessional."
bad,The company itself was not a bad place to work  for I had a problem with the manager and co workers I worked with  people not showing up for work including manager always being called in on off time as a result and management not doing her job
bad,"This company was not very considerate of the employees. They made us work all holidays and in bad weather conditions so they could continue to make money. They cut pay raises as a way to try to save money and gave no bonuses. However, the staff and management did the best they could to make a nice work environment. I enjoyed having the same customers come in because I could easily help them since I remembered what they liked. Overall Casey's was an alright place to work."
bad,"Management at store is terrible, and caseys as a over all employer is bad, they change rules all the time without letting people know, work people overly much and likes to discriminate against people with felonies."
bad,"Caseys is a great company to work for. One of those jobs you just don't dread going to, you want to go, you can't wait to see your regular customers and put a smile on their face. Overall caseys is a great place, just not for me anymore. I am ready to move forward."
bad,The job at Casey's is more of a customer service position. Good place to work. I enjoyed working there. I had developed a relationship with reoccurring customers. Only downfall working there was a lot of employees calling in at last minute and had to work a lot of extra shifts. Other issues I had with this company is there is no lunch break. And the only time you could take a break is when there were no customers or when someone could step in for you for about 10 minutes. Most of the times it just wasn't possible to take any breaks.
bad,"Casey's is a decent company to work for but most co-workers tend to be lazy and full of excuses. Management is very slack(not good) and also lazy, and did not show appreciation for workers that did do a great job. The hardest part of this job was trying to not only do my own job but pick up where others lacked. Some days I felt I was doing three to four peoples jobs including my own. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the customers and seeing the enjoyment they felt when eating the food I prepared for them!"
bad,A typical day at caseys is helping your customers and cleaning the store. I learned several things with caseys. My store management was great however her boss was not so great. The hardest part of the job there was a lot of drama at the store I worked at. The most enjoyable part would of been helping the customers making sure they left satisfied.
bad,The management had no clue what they were doing and were often disorganized. They often times played favorites and did not have work schedules made for the next week until 20 minutes before the week started. IE if you worked that Sunday for graveyard then you were not going to know until 11 40 Pm that Saturday.
bad,Its a fast pace place. Always on the go and doing something. There was a lot of nasty  talk.
bad,"When I started my employment with the company things seemed fine. As time went on I started to notice things, I was written up for being sick for instance. My employment ended after I put in a request to be put on a different shift because I was seeking a second job. My managers response to this was to keep me on the shift I requested to be off of, and schedule me more days a week."
bad,i worked 3rd shift mainly just washing and putting away dishes would help cook time to time. hardest part of the job was dealing with all the people after bar close some had no respect for the restaurant
bad,"Casey's general store is a great place to work. There are plenty of areas where employment advancement can be possible. For example, you can be a cashier, work in bakery, subs or pizza. A typical day at work at Casey's was very busy considering I had to cook certain amounts of doughnuts and food items for breakfast. I was always busy doing my own work or helping others complete theirs. Management could have been better; meaning they could have enforced some rules and policies better. The hardest part of the job was running back and forth putting doughnuts in display case, and then cooking breakfast for warmers. There were co-workers that applied themselves well, and their were some that could of done better. Overall, they were very friendly to customers, and they were helpful. My most enjoyable part of my job was customers praising me for the work I did in the bakery department. It made my day hearing that I made their day better."
bad,"Was a good job. Loved my customers, but the management team lacked management skills and common sense. Manager would publicly humiliate employees if they did something wrong, including leaving notes about that employee where other employees and customers could see. Loved the job, hated the management. Only other issue was the wonky schedule. Any day worked was just that. A day of work. Typical part-time shifts would be 1:30-11:00pm or 10:00-7:00 pm. Not much room for a life outside of work."
bad,"casey's is a decent job, however they do need to work on hiring better managers an have more communication"
bad,"The tasks I received were easy to do, but the main issue was the lack of acknowledgement and being dragged around to do other people's work for them with no choice. "
bad,This job will depend on what the people you are working with are like. I was lucky to have good managers as well as good coworkers. The managers were generally understanding and helpful and the coworkers were fun people who helped me out when I needed it.
bad,The main manager there is an uptight snob. She fired me for getting into an accident  on the way to work. It was a horrible experience. I would never want to work with her again
bad,Too much favoritism and drama at Casey's wouldn't recommend nobody to go work there. Wasn't a bad place at first but they just hire anyone now to work there it's went downhill
bad,"The manager at the store i worked at refused to hire or promote someone for kitchen manager. At the same time she doesn't know how to run a kitchen. We regularly ran out of necessary supplies. Whenever someone didn't do their job correctly, instead of being trained, someone else was put in the task leaving large loads of work on my shoulders while others were allowed to flake off.  Could have been a fun job but it became too stressful."
bad,Hours promised were not given Management was poor with communicating to employees.  Management spoke to me like a child and was very rude and hateful at times.
bad,This company does not take care of their I had given them 15 years of my time I did a great job for them and they treated me very poorlythis will be a great company to work for if they would help out their managers more
bad,"I was a good place to be at times. Often policies were over looked. Management had a defeated attitude and given up on any order to the store functions. Would over look a lot of infractions and avoid conflict because as said "" I don't care."" and ""It won't matter in the end anyways."""
bad,"I learned how to deal with crabby people, adapt to changing situations, be a mediator, stock shelves, do things how someone wants them done, and get tasks done in a timely manner."
bad,The store manager is always in the middle of everyone's personal life. She also tends to ask very inappropriate questions to her employees. Makes the work place very uncomfortable.
bad,"Obviously not the kind of job one would want to settle for  long-term. Low pay, inconsistent hours depending on the time of year and stressful nature of work. I did however get along very well with my coworkers and manager."
bad,"Working for Casey's in one of the convenience store is one of those jobs that a person may take to fill gaps in their income, like I did. It's the bog standard in customer service experiences, with everything you might expect being in that field. While it's not the perfect job, I haven't come across one that is perfect either. Usual duties include cash handling, store cleaning, taking down license plate numbers of pump approvals, those sorts of things. Alternatively, you may end up in the kitchen, making pizzas and sandwiches to sell to customers."
bad,"It is a decently busy store so it isnt ever too dull, it’s easy most of the time, as long as eveeyone is paying attention, which only sometimes happens."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is, of course, handling unhappy customers and coworkers. Unfortunately, that is a daily task with this company and comes with the job. Casey's is a fast paced and fast growing company, which is fantastic but leads to lenient hiring. They want bodies to fill positions, whether or not those bodies have brains doesn't really concern upper management. They definitely want employees to advance in the company, but the problem with that is they don't provide thorough training and tools for those they advance, in my experience. The store level employees and management team are the ones, in my opinion, who need the most training as they are the ones who come face to face with the customers; the customers who are the whole reason for the company being what it is, but those who are above store level often don't help those that aren't."
bad,I enjoyed working here. I was primarily in the kitchen during the over nights. However the manager wasn't and still isn't fit for the job. They had nearly over 25 people quit and look else where due to her.
bad,Good dependable job with a fun and friendly atmosphere. Great management with flexible shifts and a decent wage considering the type of work. It would be a awesome part time job.
bad,"•	Customer service, greet customers as they come in and leave •	Fix customer complaints, fast paced •	Multi task, communicate with coworkers"
bad,"The crew itself, I loved working with them they were great people. The management was a little different. I felt like i was bossed around a lot and the management didn't have much respect for it's employees. For a pizza shop/gas station, the management made us treat it like it was a hospital and needed to be in perfect condition. If we even did one thing off, even if we tried our hardest, we'd get lectured and talked down to for a good 30 minutes, making us feel bad the rest of the day. Their was alot of ordering around by the store manager and never any le-way to just have a good day at work. Always made us feel like we were under pressure and then the next day of our shift, we'd come in with a couple sheets of paper telling us everything we did wrong the day before. Never felt like anything was good enough for the store manager."
bad,"Seriously don't work here, you will begin to hate your life. And nobody wants to hate their life. Just trust me. YOU DO NOT WANT TO WORK HERE"
bad,"Good place to work, but I wouldn't expect to be there for a long time."
bad,"This company was very unorganized.  The management team was always frantic and could not handle their employees.  The employees were very lazy in their work ethic and did not meet sanitation requirements.  Also they had a hard time keeping employees.  The employees would call off every other day, while I picked up their slack.  This would have  been the hardest part of the job, was to maintain kitchen standards while trying to do mine and another's job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
bad,They encourage a positive work environment which is a good thing and their policy and procedures are okay. A typical day at work is challenging everyday. I learned how to deal with people's different personalities to get task completed for the day. Managing other employees is challenging because you have to know each employees strengths and weaknesses. My co-workers were great. Everyone worked together to get a task completed. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting people and solving customer complaints to satisfy the customer. The hardest part of the job was the days when I just could not help a customer.
bad,Was not treated well. Bad management. Pay was good. Feel like they need to have better management. Not treated well by other employees. Was not trained properly for Food Service position
bad,"It was okay, there were okay people there to work with bit the manager wasn't that reliable, and she was harsh about days off. I enjoyed it while I had it"
bad,I was working 7 days a week and over 10 hours a day constantly for a span of 3 months. There was no communication between other store managers and a lot of beef between everyone
bad,management dont work weekends or holidays and is always levaing early sometimes your the only one putting truck away you always have to fix someone elses mistake im only one going in the cooler half the time there is  ALOT of complaining
bad,"When something big happens that needs to get taken care of they take their time. Also asking not to work with someone because of personal reasons i would have to work with them anyways. The other people i worked with were great i loved them, they welcome you with open arms and smiles on their face. Just are not good at taking care of problems"
bad,"Casey's as a corporation was a fairly nice place to work but unfortunately the location I was at had made a poor choice in management. At first glance you would think that  the place was well managed, however that is because the GM had decided he was going to be everyone's friend instead of their boss. Scheduling was a complete mess, night shift had 2-3x the workload that dayshift had (I worked both night and day shifts and as such consider myself unbiased in that) and the place was riddled with employees that clearly did not care about the position and had no business being there but the manager did not was to deal with confrontation in firing them."
bad,"I learned how to work with others in a fast paced environment where speed is vital.  A lot of the people that I worked with were wonderful people and made working together enjoyable. "
bad,"Unless you have an official full time position, you're looking at 30 hours or less per week. Plenty of empty words and broken promises. Don't look to management for help."
bad,"Supervisors that I experienced really did not care about your family time.  They just cared about the store.  Did not offer to help out much, especially when it came to holidays.  They had them off and they did not care if you worked them.  20 inches of snow and I was told to make it in when I could.  Should have closed the store."
bad,I loved my job here and the benifits were great but upper management made it feel like you were just another employee that could be replaced and i feel like they didnt treat the employees very well
bad,"The co-workers were pleasant to work with, typical work day was busy from start to the end of shift, manager was easy to get along with, meeting new people was the most enjoyable part of the entire job, learning all the management."
bad,"Managers treated me like i was just a temporary employee, not concerned about helping employees.Managers expected their employees to work extra hard, but didnt reward good work."
bad,You'll end up being by yourself in the kitchen most of the time and expected to get everything done while still taking care of orders and keeping the warmers filled. I liked the people I worked with but that wasn't enough to keep it from being soul-crushingly boring. Management is terrible at communicating when needed and a high turnover rate make it hard to stay there for long without getting incredibly frustrated
bad,"It's stressful. Company only cares for customers. Raises are insignificant. Customers are allowed to treat you like garbage. They don't feed their workers even though you MAKE THE FOOD. Seriously, if the pizza roundabout is filled and the hour goes by, you have to throw away all that food. Eat it? No you get fired for that unless you pay... The job is a joke and they treat you like they know you're going to leave. If it weren't for my coworkers being awesome I would not have stayed for 9 months."
bad,"It was fun at first, loved my job and coming daily. Management wasn’t the best and made for an uneasy work environment and the overturn rate was and still stays at an all time high, makes working their difficult"
bad,While i worked 3rd shift i had to do so much and still get everything ready for hectic mornings and almost never got everything done on time. sometimes power would go out. and others the shifts before wouldn't get their stuff done so i had to do that as well.
bad,"I worked the kitchen in Casey's it was not hard work, but it was busy. Not much support in the back, so a lot of the time cashiers had to come to the back to help."
bad,"I have worked at 2 different Casey's locations and both of them were not that great of an experience. The first one was awful, purely because management was awful, and the second was barely tolerable because of the other workers."
bad,It was a bad experience for me pay wasn’t good not enough hours for a full timer .the GM don’t treat workers right and also use bad language or threats to keep workers feel like if they complain about anything they will loose their job
bad,"Not my favorite place to work. Had one manager for the entire place, and about 4 employees to run a 24 hr business. I had to fill out police reports because apparently we can't just kick people out for being vulgar, just for my manager to be upset that I wasn't able to get the soda stocked completely."
bad,Worked in multiple stores and never really had great managers. The assistant manager is expected to do all the difficult stuff. You're super overworked and under paid for what they expect you to do. If you arent close personally with upper management before you start you'll never advance. 8 years and didn't move up at all.  A LOT of favoritism in this company.  Working hard is pointless because you get taken advantage of. And they're always shorthanded so you really have to mess up to get fired. All in all it's a great job for lazy high school kids or college kids needing money while in school but that's about it
bad,Its an okay place to work. The don't know how to run a business.  You will never advance in anything so if that's the type of job your looking for then this is the place.
bad,"Just a person that does all the kitchen work, sandwiches, pizzas, donuts, cookies, cleaning, trash, temperatures, stocking, waiting out of dates, making new to stock more"
bad,"I worked for this company for two years. The job is simple. The work is repetitive. The people are great. The management is very very poor. I'm not just talking about the store manager, I'm talking the district managers and even the corporate people. They think of the employees as a number and just working bodies. I dont recomend this job unless you're pretty desperate. They make you feel awful."
bad,"I worked at 9 and would run the till and make coffee wipe counters down.stocked shelves train new employees, help out in Deli when needed stock the cooler cleaned bathrooms."
bad,"I learned how to make pizza, and i learned how to work the register but what i don't like is all the drama thats there with my co-workers, then the really stupid thing is wasting a bunch of food."
bad,I liked working cashier and being the delivery driver. The only problems I had was the inconsistent scheduling. The customer base was mainly morning people so in and out.
bad,"Its a bad place for a teen to work, because they don't work with the kids hours. They do not pay attention to child labor laws. kids under 18 and in high school have to be off by 10pm.. they don't do it."
bad,"worked for a couple summers and the job was terrible! I was not a smoker so I did not get any breaks, barely was able to go to the bathroom. People were not responsible to uphold their own duties."
bad,"I have worked in a few locations at Caseys. I really liked my job. Only left due to poor manager."
bad,"When I started management was on leave for surgeries. Never came back. "
bad,"A good store needs to have a good manager to direct and enhance the work of the employees. They need to be a good listener, organized, fallow through on issues and willing to eliminate ALL problems. This simply was not the case at this particular store."
bad,some management needs work. complaints not delt with properly. employees are often rude to customers. The job its self is easy. It is mostly about customer service and making customers satisfied.
bad,greet customers stock and don't believe everything your told.The store was clean. the customer were nice and management was. The hardest part not knowing what hours you were working
bad,I absolutely loved all my customers and workers i wish it would offered more benefits and that i i wasnt pregnant but i got pregnant and then they decided to lay me off
bad,"There is a severe shortage of employees here, therefore, the few are over worked. Breaks are only used if the store is not busy, which is not the case most of the time"
bad,"Went in at 3:30 am to make donuts then either worked in the kitchen the rest of the day or went to cashier, it all depended on what was going on that day. I learned a lot about the way a convenience store runs. The management was iffy to say the least. Had a lot of turnover while I was there. Everyone mostly got along of course we did have our disagreements on occasion. Juggling the many jobs was very difficult but once they were accomplished I had a big deal of accomplishment."
bad,"problems with management not getting along, horrible ordering skills and letting everyone else run the joint instead of them."
bad,"making pizzas and other foods,using a register,working for other people,management was not good,keeping things clean and stocked up"
bad,I stock shelves and clean the store.  I was helping make pizzas but was moved to stock girl.  I have not been trained any further in the kitchen.  Because of my disability (left arm strength) the management will not allow me to grow at the store
bad,"Waiting on customers all day, running register, cleaning store, book work, banking, I did everything. It was nice meeting new people or seeing old faces. Nothing really hard. Some times book work got a little tricky but other then that it was pretty easy."
bad,"Very unorganized place, with very many unprofessional people employed here. The manager did not know how to run the store properly and sometimes had a very bad attitude with her employes."
bad,"Helping Customers have a quick, friendly and accurate experience, I learned that I work very well independently. Management was easy to work with. Watching customers change from day to day was the most enjoyable part of this job."
bad,Enjoyed the job but not enough to keep my interest for a 40 hour work week.. Repetitive work. Co-workers were full of drama.. Managment was always angre
bad,"I only worked here while going to school, but I had no complaints.  Friendly staff and management."
bad,it was just like any other minimum wage job. easy and not worth the money
bad,"There is a lot more to this job than people think.  You are busy all day, no lunch breaks are given, but your work day is 8 hours instead of 9 hours with a 1 hour lunch break."
bad,Like the pay and the coworkers and even with extra work still sometimes just standing around.
bad,It was okay.  I enjoyed my work but the management was lacking.  I did learn a lot about convenience stores.
bad,I did not care for this job only because of my management. They treated me with disrespect.
bad,Working for Casey's General Store was mostly enjoyed by the customers and visitors whom came in the store on a daily bases. Being apart of the courtesy they brought unto me made my job very refreshing. The hadest part for me was making sure the customer received the welcome service they were looking for upon entering into the store on their exit from the store. Overall the co-workers whom I had an opportunity to meet while I was employed made each day memorible.
bad,"took care of customers, did book work, overseen over night employees"
bad,"I shouldn't have to tell you for service is a drain on moral. The employment takes about anyone. It turns into a high turn over rate, but when they get a good worker they will try to keep you there as long as they can. As for the others... You will be carrying them the whole time."
bad,"During my year working for Casey's general store I found myself pushing myself to be a better me. During the summer months and into 2018 the staffing was very low and I had felt overworked, it became a very un-enjoyable place to work with no signs of improvement after I was gone."
bad,"They illegally let me go. Never did a sit down or sign any papers, they just crossed me off the list and never returned my calls. I've contacted both my store manager and my district manager never got a call back or an explanation."
bad,"A typical day at work included interacting with customers and their needs. Working as a team member performing cashier duties, product assistance and cleaning. Assisting customers with store and product complaints. Guaranting positive customer experiences and resolving all customer complaints. Maintaining adequate cash supply in cash drawers in multiple checkout stations. Being responsible for ringing up customers in a timely manner and guaranteeing high level of customer service. Organizing the store by returning all merchandise to its proper place. Replenishing"
bad,Casey's gives you the opportunity to meet new people and build a relationship with the community. I had an awesome boss who would jump in and help in the busiest time of day without question. She never yelled or made it seem like you weren't doing your job.
bad,"I worked in the kitchen. Pay was decent, $9.00 an hour. Managers were fantastic, very professional and friendly. "
bad,"I prepared food for customers who came in and ordered or placed an order online. I also worked at the cash register. I knew all the procedures for cleaning in the kitchen, out in front, and also the bathrooms."
bad,I loved worked at Casey. I like to work around the people. They made me feel welcomed and i felt like at home! I liked to work in the kitchen and help unload and put away truck.I always got along with my boss
good,I have worked at two different stores and had bad experiences at both. The managers were both very rude and condescending. Always talked down to employees and even once refused to give me a day off that was made clear that I could not work on due to sharing a vehicle with my spouse. Also never felt like anything I did was ever good enough.
good,"Favoritism, understaffed, under qualified management, employees who wouldn't do their jobs, management favored employees who had been there longer"
good,"Management at Casey's is poor to put it nicely, there is no accountability for them whatsoever. Managers are free to leave the store whenever they feel, without repercussions. Loyalty means nothing to them, it doesn't matter if you've been there 5 years or 1, they'll treat you as if you were just hired and that you can be replaced instantly. There is a recurring theme working there, corporate will notify the store to cut hours, which makes employees leave, causing a short staffed-ness that lasts until the next cycle of hour cutting. Oh, and don't expect to get a raise anytime soon, you'll be at a constant 9.25/hr forever."
good,"Love my hours when I worked donut shift, was alone while store was closed kick on music and just go, hated that when we opened we were not aloud to have music, owner believes it take from our customers"
good,Management was awful and treated everyone like they were lesser people. The first assistant once laughed at another employee because he had injured his hand.
good,Worked for over a year but never had personal time. They don't pay enough for the amount of stress there is. Management isn't the best either. They tell you to do stuff but won't do the same in return.
good,I wouldn't recommend anyone to really work there I enjoyed my co workers but anyone above you can make your life a living heck. I never got paid for 60+ hours and they let me take a week vacation and when i came back corporate fired me. So dont work here.
good,The old management was awesome but the new lady working is just uncaring and unprofessional towards the employees working for her she is rude and does not take responsibilities outside of work into consideration when it can’t be helped
good,Overall I asked to be paid a specific amount starting out and they decided to offer me a lower amount. They expect a ton of work done for very little pay. Also they expect you to always be busy and don't offer breaks.
good,"What can I say, it was a job, and I needed the money. "
good,It is a great company if you have a manager that knows what they are doing. This manager was more interested going outside with her friends she had hired. They would go outside smoking and flirting with their men friends. They would leave one person inside to run register and kitchen at the same time usually during the rush hours of the day. Always lied to the District Manager about why people were complaining. Always blamed it on the one person who was left in the store alone running everything.
good,"I actually enjoyed working here for the most part and even liked it at first. But then the manager started scheduling me outside of my availability including overnight shifts on weekends. He kept calling me while I was in class as I’m a full time student this was very annoying. Things were going fine when I was actually working, but one day the manager had me work another overnight shift and told me I could have the weekend off. Apparently, this didn’t mean Sunday so I woke up to a voicemail from them called back and told them what he said and then I went in for my next shift and was crossed off the schedule. When I tried to talk to the manager about it he ignored me"
good,I hated Casey's more than any job that I have ever worked. The managers there take no responsibility and force workers to do their work for them without proper pay.
good,The manager that hired me was very rude and always had an issue with everything. That’s all and some of the others in charge were very abusive to there role or power they had.
good,The management likes to play favorites and perpetuate drama. i hear it is like this across the board. The best employees often get stuck doing all of the work.
good,"You hire on as a MW general worker. There really isn't much more to offer on the matter other than from my experience, working a minimum wage job is not sustainable even at full time hours in today's cost of living, even in my area of southern rural Illinois. That said, the only redeeming factor would be the people I work with. To that end, it's minimum wage; what would you expect?"
good,"I was offered an overnight position. I was happy to take it at first, it was guaranteed hours. I was pregnant. It became harder to stay asleep during the day, so I asked to move my hours to the day and evening time. They agreed to, but then cut my hours, and from there the manager at the time was just not nice and very unfriendly to me."
good,"Nobody gets wrote up when needed, and you work split shifts. Doesn't pay enough for shift differentials or at all for that mattef. Also the benefits aren't great."
good,It's an opportunity for young people to get experience for the work force. They will cross train in different areas of the store. You are able to request to stay in one area but îf you are trained then they will put you where you are needed.
good,"Nothing bad to say.  If you get your job done, and done right, then there shouldn't be any issues.  Maybe some better management skill training in all Casey's would help based on my experience working as an Assistant Manager."
good,"I work midnights so its typically slow. I haven't learned much at this job just your basic common sense. Management is very poor and they don't do their job most the time everyone is always picking up their slack. the most enjoyable part of the job is working midnights staying away from all the other co-workers and their drama so I can focus on doing my task at hand, I would not recommend Hartford Casey's to anyone."
good,"Caseys would be a great place for younger people to work as a first job or a temporary job, however they don't really work with your personal life very well and don't appreciate the work that you do for them."
good,"It all really depends on your district Manager. My first one was amazing. My second one was terrible. "
good,"I make the food that gets sold to our customers. When I have down time, I clean up and do dishes."
good,"We would have people refuse to show up to work, and management refused to make any changes. The pay was good, but at the store, I worked at it was not worth it. The workplace was filled with drama, we had people walk out and quit on the spot. Overall I wouldn't recommend working here."
good,"If you are thinking of applying -dont, just dont. It's not worth working EVERY day for very little appreciation. Management has no clue are is inept ."
good,It's a good job understaffed and management is not good. Pay is good but you don't get a lot of hours. Only the managers favorites get hours and appreciation.
good,I liked working at caseys I like interacting with customers and vendors the other employees I worked with always made it fun to be at work everyday  and the food was delicious
good,"Gas Station work is not cut out for everyone. You have to be well versed in small talk. The homeless and dopers are always loitering, making the job uneasy at times."
good,Am a hard worker but i am looking for a change i love my work just need a change.  Caseys is a great place to work for they care about there customers and employees.
good,No room for advancement even though they say they have multiple opportunities it's more of a people u know type of situation and a cliche type system. Highly dissappointed with the false claims of advancement
good,job was ok it was a customer service job and i worked overnight and im used to labor work so it really wasnt my scenery but i did like it an got used to seeing regular customers.
good,"Very immature behaviors, Register is done weird, No one stocks freezers, Training is sub par, they will put you places you dont know how to do and expect you to do it by a book"
good,"The management is the whole issue with this particular store. It's the blind leading the blind. Teamwork is undeniably terrible, no room for advancement even when ur working full time hours you get told there is no full time positions available. The manager refuses to take charge and correct the errors of the employees. People leaving the store while on the clock and leaving the other person alone in the store for 30 mins to a hour. Just a poor place to work. there are some good employees there but they are getting fed up with everyone else's laziness and at some point this store will lose all it's hard working employees and be left with the lazy ones."
good,Taking care of the public can sometimes be a challenge. Learning to never take things personally and learning that everybody isnt as nice and polite as you would think
good,"Casey's is a very busy business, and will keep you busy. There is always something to do or clean. The customer aspect is the best part you have customers that are there everyday and they become like friends or family. The interaction with most customers make it worth it all the hard work and stress. They do not pay as well as other convince stores Wich is mostly responsible for high turnover."
good,"I used to love my job. They took so much away and expected so much more that I came to hate my job. It used to be fun to work there, it no longer is. When you wake up sick to your stomach thinking about going to work you realize that you have the wrong job."
good,"Any job is great starting out, but I was seeking a career and there was favoritism. No room for advancement. Worked like dogs and underpaid for doing so"
good,I honestly wouldn't recommend working here. They don't really hire within the store for management opportunities. Your hours can get cut for no reason.
good,I enjoy the people I work with and for. The work family balance is not what it should be.  I am hoping to see change in the years to come. Corrective Actions are given like candy.
good,Here st casey's general store. I worked in production in which i took food orders and made them. All the way from pizza to cheeseburgers to sub sandwhiches and taking out trash and cleaning the kitchen.
good,"Several call offs cause an assistant manager to work many double shifts. Calls to upper management for shift help get no response. However, they will complain to you about overtime."
good,Very stressful environment and unorganized. Management is rude to not only employees but customers as well. the pay that is given for the amount of work expected is not up to standards.
good,I had a lot of fun working there with great people but like most places they have horrible Manager turnover and not much room to grow in the company like instead of hiring store managers in store they would hire one from another caseys store were that Manager had little to no success.
good,"understanding of professional working relationships, how to get delegated tasks finished in a timely manner, and the importance of quantity control. The most difficult part of the job was the process of icing the donuts within the allotted time limit. Feeling successful after accomplishing my daily tasks and knowing that I was making quality products is what was most enjoyable about this job."
good,Making coffee and donuts along with running the cash register was rather boring to me. The job had no chance for advancement and I didn't learn anything new. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was close to home.
good,"count your draw, the bag of money , sign in on the computer, make coffee, wait on the customer's, make sure everything was filled, cleaned, talk with the customer's, card the people that wasn't of age, became the Asst Manager, open the store, count the drawer for the right amount of money we start out with, get the money out of the bag and count that, order the groceries for the store, get produce if we ran out, fill in to work if no body showed or called."
good,"I worked 3,3 hr shift per week and every other weekend. Wasn't worth my time."
good,"I like casey's but some of the managment are unfair and show to keep the sneaky,informants,trouble makers,and who don't really care about the coustmer. That also includes mangment also.The corperate office has the mind set that the lower level of employees are expendale at anytime.They have this thing that if you have a drive off on the gass pumps you have a choice,a writeup or pay the shortage your self so it does'nt go on your file.Three or more write ups for the same thing you get suspended or fired.They have drive off's because they would rather get rid of that worker(who needs that job) unsted of spending the money to camras on the canapys over the pumps(like most of all gas stations),Its cheeper for them to fire insted of fixing.They have so many driveoff because everyone knows they don't have the security like others.Casey's is not the Casey's that it started out to be.A nieghborhood general store.They lost the concept of the idea they were before the be money let then forget who they were. A little town General stores.I relize they have to compete with other bigger stores but did you ave to forget the idea of what a general store was to people in places outside of big cities? People live out of big citys because its to complcated and busy.A freindly uncomplcated ,fair,trust worthy nieghborhood helpful general stores.Use some common sence when it comes to their employees,and (managers),when a menager tells their people that she will them to the wolves in a heart beat no matter what the situation or even if it's his or her screwup she's not looseing her job,they will.That"
good,They did not stick to the agreement when hired. Management did not show up or follow through with anything. Store was not well run at all. They didn't care
good,"Freeport caseys is run by a lowlife who has to work 80 plus hours a week because she has zero clue how to manage her employees. Freeport Caseys has the highest turnover of all area Caseys. It is because of the store manger and the lazy team leader in the kitchen. The kitchen lead do dishes, not her."
good,"Very good store if it's well managed, otherwise everything falls apart: running out of things for example. With enough staff you can accomplish a lot. Each person is able to finish everything on their shift."
good,"Great company, limited resources for employees, expect employees to focus all of their time on the company.  Everyone is expected to put the company before their family."
good,It was easy working at Casey’s and I liked it but I had a baby and needed to be home for awhile. I cooked and cleaned and made food. I made dough and cut vegetables
good,"The people I worked with were fun and always willing to help me if i was busy. The management could use some work. Its a fun place to work, lots of jokes and humor."
good,Most of my time spent there has been me working alone while everyone else just stands around on their phones or telling each other stories. There have been times in which I will be overwhelmed and the other workers just leave to do something that isnt needed
good,I only recommend this job for starters because working at a gas station is not going to pay the bills. This was my first job and it was the only job that I could walk to before I got a car.
good,"It is a very hostile place to work. Yelled at, cussed at and if you say anything, there is retaliation. Like loss of hours etc. You're not appreciated or acknowledged for your good deeds. Tons of drama and no leadership!"
good,management here needs to be retrained as they do not repremend when needed and trys to be the employees friend rather that their boss. that allowed for her to be walked all over by a lot of employees
good,"it is a good job for part timers.cant make a living on it.has no insurance.have good mangers,never seen the regional manger.they will answer your questions and help you when you need it"
good,"They need to provide constant training. Any time Casey's would change a policy or a food item for the kitchen, there was no training, you heard by word of mouth from other employees."
good,Definitely if you are young and looking for a little cash this wouldn't be horrible pay but not long term.  Management can be caring about you I'm sure but they have a funny way of showing it really.
good,Hours weren’t as secure as I would have liked the staff was nice. Manager was angry and kitchen was very understaffed for lack of better words the pay was nice
good,Depite the age of many of the employees there is lots of drama and backstabbing for the betterment of themselves. They also do not want anyone else they work with to advance within management if they are not able to.
good,The store that I worked at was not fair to all employees some employees can get by with everything others cannot I was fired for tardiness but another employee can be late everyday and not get wrote up up totally unfair
good,"working at caseys in wapella I was under a manager who took part in work place drama, allowed employees to do drugs in the freezer and out by the dumpster and wouldn't allow me to do my job with out feeling threatened as I was constantly threatened for turning in the people who were doing drugs at the store a new district manager took over and both her and the manager teamed up on me for not minding my own business resulting in me finding a different job and quitting immediately. I refuse to go there anymore for any reason as after I had quit and came in for pizza I was made feel very unwelcome in ""her store"" by the dirty looks and gossip she spoke to another employee loud enough I could hear."
good,People hired at Casey's aren't exactly friendly or necessarily qualified in the beginning but no training is necessary.  It is also possible to become manager by starting out as a pizza maker.
good,"My typical work day was signing on to the register. Ringing items uo, giving back change to the customer. I would also keep things clean and tidy, make sure there was enough coffee made, along with tea. Keeping trash picked up and taking out the full trash. I also kept shelves and pegs faced (pulled forward and stocked) correctly."
good,"high school drama worse then high school. manager spread rumors about employees, manager yelled at employees, manager had favorite employees who could get away with anything even getting high on the clock, while other emplyees bullied"
good,"I enjoyed my customers. If you have a good, supportive Manager you could have a good career at Casey's.  If you want a career you need to keep advancing, but try not to let them advance you to the point of incompetence. Try not to stay in a position too long that you may outprice yourself. There's a very fine line. Casey's has so many policies that it is very easy to sight policies to fire."
good,"Casey's General Store is not required by law to give breaks or lunch.  No matter how long your shift, be prepared to stand on your feet. You will be completing numerous tasks. Be able to lift no less than 50 lbs.."
good,It can be enjoyable at times but most of the time there is too much drama. The General manager is a bit rough and does not come off as someone you can go to if you have a problem. The assistant manager is super sweet but employees seem to take advantage of this.
good,My first manager was awesome. She found other employment and her replacement was not a very effective manager. Incessant drama and bickering and short notice schedule changes.
good,"The management is never THAT willing to put forth any effort to help maintain the store. Never expected it to be a steady job, but the hours come and go, mostly without warning. That could just be the store I was at, but overall it sounds company wide."
good,"have mercy on anyone who decides to take on a job at caseys. The people are great but it's not worth the stress it puts on you. Great pay though, still not worth it"
good,"I like working at the store itself but when it comes to district managers and area supervisors it needs help.  I was to get a raise when I was there a year, it now is 5 months into a year and still no raise.  Needless to say I'm looking for something else.  "
good,"I would go in on a typical day at work and get something to drink and talk to the manager. I would count money from the cash register and help customers.I would count cigarettes and then at about 8:00pm I would take the trash out. At about 10:30pm I would turn off the lights,count the money in drawer, pack up, set the alarm, lock the doors and leave."
good,The Management treated each worker differently; co workers were for the most part a joy to work with. I also feel we didnt get paid enough for everything we were expected to do during a shift.
good,The employees are very purky and upbeat but you can tell that they work very hard to accomplish their job tasks. The job itself is not hard but it can be overwhelming at times. They cut back the employees hours so what usually takes two people to do now is being done by one person. The customers are great. Most of which are regulars at the store.
good,The people there were great to work with the management not so tho got removed and wasn't told why.  was my first job tho. some of the floor management was absolutly fantasic  tho.
good,Busy in the morning. Makes time go by fast. I like being able to be done early so I have the rest of my day and am able to coach the sports I love.
good,Fast paced and very busy location. I personally enjoyed this job. Other than all the favoritism going on. Management was not competent enough to run the store. Only one person running the kitchen one super busy days.
good,Don't expect much--it is just a gas station after all. Good job for high school and/or college students. They do work with school and other job schedules
good,The management level of Casey's needs an overhaul. I was a cashier and there was no incentive to go above and beyond in the job. All the company does is point out improvements needed and nothing on exceptional that hs been reached. Ability to advance is long and almost impossible.
good,A typical day at work was always a delight because of the customers .My co-workers were always so helpful and used team work. Management was never really understood because of not having everything well put and the treatment from them was never delightful.
good,"I absolutely loved my job when I worked for Casey's, the only reason I am no longer there is because the store manager expected me to put my job before my mother. Extremely unprofessional and inconsiderate."
good,"I worked the evening shift, But on the days that I opened the store, I balanced the books from the day before, Counted out the money for the register, turned on the pumps, started the coffee, made sure all the prices on the pumps and cigs were correct. Made sure the employees that I worked with had every thing they needed to start their day. Fought with the safe combination daily because it was an old safe and very picking to open. Made sure the doors and lights were open and on at the proper time, Ran the cashier, dealt with any customer complaints, made sure the machines were always stocked. Cleaned the floors and the counter tops. Faced all of the shelves. Swept the floors and cleaned the windows. Took the rugs out to dust off, kept the floors mopped especially on rainy days. "
good,"The job was fun and the other employees were fun to work with, but I saw to much drug trafficing between the manager and other employees. As I am not into drugs, watching that made my work enviroment uncomfortable. The manager was always sitting in her office playing on her phone and made my job harder as I was runnging the kitchen and register alone."
good,"I feel this is a great place to work if you are just starting out at a minimum wage job. I do not agree with how management handles many of their situations as well as the fact that a lot of the employees were lazy at the location that I worked. The job itself is fun and the customers make it that way. I personally would never work for Casey's General Store again, however this job may be great for others."
good,"I feel I have good days at work. I am very productive and like to keep busy.I work well with my co-workers. I feel their s poor management at our store. The hardest part of my job is when a customer isnt satisfied. Most enjoyable part s customer service, I enjoy the public."
good,"Management and environment is very stressful. Kitchen food is 50% off for a discount, but anything else in the store is full price. Raises suck, if you get one."
good,The Manager was upset over one customer saying they won't come back to the store because of me. Manager tells me she spent 14 yrs building her customer base. Casey's was the only store in town.
good,"Overall, the job itself was easy and the I was able to get along with everyone I worked with, whether or not we necessarily agreed on job productivity, policy, etc. Management was very negative and played favorites, career advancement was not really an option (waiting for over a year to go from part time to full time)."
good,"With my experience working at Casey's, its all very hands on right at the beginning. they train very well while they might miss a step here and there, but they want to prepare you to be on your own either in the kitchen or on the register. you have to be prepared (including in the kitchen) for nights you might get slammed with orders. you always have another person there to help you but most of the work is independent"
good,"I am thankful to Caseys for the chance to work when things were down for me. The day to day isn't so bad, granted it would be better with more adequate staffing and either better pay or an actual opportunity to go full time."
good,greeting costumers.   exchange of money for products . Make sure everything up to code . And nice and clean make sure money drawer and safe counted correctly.
good,I didn mind working there but they knew I was having problems at home and on a personal level and they still scheduled me when I wasnt available I wasn't able to stay when they needed me and made me feel bad when I couldn't stay
good,"Keep to self ,do not trust no one..fast places to work ,do not trust the Boss,  start your day helping people and making food,then prep things for the next day.."
good,"Casey's hires people under false pretenses, such as the job security is shaky based on budgetary restrictions/cuts. "
good,Depending on the person cooking sometime they wouldnt use gloves and bad hygiene made the food nasty to me some of the employees their didnt respect the work environment and would just leave the place a mess
good,"your at a loss for help. kitchen management never actually trains you, and when they do its wrong. in summary they over work you, under appreciate you. and can and will lie about promotions to full time"
good,If I had a different manager at the store a lot more people would've stayed there longer.  She had no respect for anyone that worked for her and we were pretty much slaves.
good,"No matter on which side of the store you work, kitchen or retail, "
good,Busy place to work. Employees are pretty good to work with. Low pay for the work expected. No benefits are offered. Some managers are okay but district managers are not.
good,Casey's is an okay job. They offer very little pay for large amounts of work. The staffing is very inconsistent and very high turnover rates. Low staffing makes it very stressful at work. Very good food and fun work if you like making pizzas. I enjoyed that aspect.
good,"As a cashier there, you are responsible for just about everything there at the store/gas station. There is usually just you and a person in the kitchen area. The person in the kitchen may not know how to work the register, making it very difficult to get everything done that needs to be. Also, there is no offical lunch break, no matter how long your shift is, there is supposed to be, but if you are te obly one at the register, which is most of the time, then you can't take a break."
good,"I do enjoy working for casey's however, the area managers are very inconsiderate of issues going on in store, making it very hard to properly solve issues"
good,Working at Casey's has been a good experience for me. I learned how to count large amounts of money. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment. I also learned how to deal with multiple types of personalities.
good,Reduced everyone's hours but increased the work load. Lots of gossip. Laziness and long breaks. Management is blind. Unstable hours. No vacation pay or sick days.
good,"Working at Casey’s was enjoyable when first hired, but as time went on and new management came, employees dropped like flies and many were unhappy with the work environment and higher management."
good,Will most likely never work for Casey's General Store again. No matter how hard management tried it was never enough.. People are unfortunately unreliable.
good,Let the lazy people who did nothing rise while the hard workers were yelled at and ridiculed. 3 full time employees and the rest were part time. No one helps anyone else.
good,Casey's made very high demands of their supervisors. Travel was emanate. Days were long and if you were committed to your job it didn't stop when you are were on vacation.
good,Unfair treatment of employees. Your hours are completely all over the place. I would close then have to get up a couple hours later to open. They don't give you breaks even though at the time it was mandatory I took one due to my injury.
good,"I loved my customers and some of the management that I came into contact with during my time at Casey's. I moved up the ladder rather quickly and then transferred to a different store in a different state. At my new store everything was entirely different...and horrible. Eventually the store manager and the first assistant up and quit all in the same week leaving me as the only person in the store that knew how to do books and upper management took advantage of the situation. My store was severely understaffed and there was absolutely no support from the area supervisor or district manager. I was stuck working delivery, donuts, and books every day...and I was asking the few employees that I had left to work the same kind of crazy hours for days and days without even a hint of a day off. I couldn't keep promising them that it would get better when it wouldn't, so I quit. Casey's isn't a horrible place to work, as long as you work in a well managed area for a decent management team. The pay is terrible and the benefits are pretty bad too though."
good,I would not return or recommend.. terrible management low hours and terrible hours.. don't advance. Over worked.. night shift left disaster for morning shift which was me coming in at 440 am.. constant Chaotic
good,"I liked working with my coworkers and being part of the team, however once we got a new manager I was constantly getting called in to work on my days off and there was a time I did not have a sitter for my baby and she told me I either come in in 2 hours or I fire you,  so I quit."
good,The General Manager in the store I worked in played favorites and let her favorites do nothing and get away with everything. Those of us who actually did our work were rewarded with write ups and loss of hours when we said something the GM or her favorites didn't like.
good,its ok ... youll think its only short term then before you know it youre there for 1 1/2 yrs and cant find the time to apply for anything else.  good stepping stone
good,The work day goes quickly when people are there to work but Casey's is full of lax management and insubordinate workers. I got used to doing my work as quickly and as efficiently as possible so that I could move on with my day as I was one of the few to do quality work throughout the day.
good,The management wanted to be your friend not the boss but you need a boss at work not a best friend there was to much gossip to much drama to many people trying to be in charg.
good,"Casey's is a good place to work for extra income but the wages are lower than Kwik Trip, and the food is filled with hydrogenated oils alot in every single item.  If you want to be healthy don't eat your meals there."
good,"There's always work to be done. Management needed replacing, lots of gossip, lots of drama. Worked with a free decent coworkers. Difficulty in getting and keeping hours. Doesn't work well with employees gabbing other jobs/obligations."
good,Basic level employees have sway over the general manager leading to abuses of other employees. Blatant refusal to complete simple tasks assigned. The environment is friendly but non confrontational attitude of those in charge lead to favored employees working less and creating more work for the other shifts.
good,This was a typical retail job that was always busy. The biggest downfall of the position is the low salary and lack of opportunity to advance. The hours were acceptable and the team was fun to work wtih most of the time.
good,"The kitchen staff job is one of the easiest jobs i've had by far. Management, and Store rules are only applied to those of their choosing. Favoritism plays a major part in our store."
good,I think it a good place to work but I feel like no matter how loyal you are to Casey's they don't hold that same respect.  The people go behind backs and talk bad about other employees.
good,"Goes by fast just dont like night shift much, because i end up sleeping all my days off away. Would much like more help in the kitchen for certain things."
good,"When I was there, things were not ran fairly. I was terminated unfairly. Management played favorites a lot. I was barely given hours at the end of my employment. I was the only person scheduled in my area, whether that was in the kitchen or cashier. A lot of times it got really busy and it was difficult to finish my work tasks alone."
good,The job is super easy and I love the people I work with. I love the awesome customers I have and get to see on a daily basis. I just don't care for the management.
good,i had recived alot of hours and had the opportunity to meet new people from other stores that were awsome and treated me aswome especially casey from the new store in papillion neb but the store i worked for i never recived any compensation for any of my travel and i feel like i never got treated fairly.
good,My manager was a wonderful person.  Only worked part-time and the hours were overnight and daytime which didn't allow me to get proper rest and to get on a regular schedule.
good,"I Loved what I did and I really got along with some other people in the kitchen, but the manager is biased and discriminating. Another employee lied to her face, but instead of listening to my side and watching the video tape, the manage called me a liar and other names and refused to listen to anything I had to say."
good,Prepared food items and took orders for pizzas and made the pizzas stocked shelves cleaned the store ran the cash register. Its a pretty laid back place to work however the pay wasn't that great.
good,A typical day is working hard and doing my job. Lots of customer service skills are a must at this job and I liked working here. The benefits were terrible though
good,its a job like any other you go in do your work and go home might get lucky and make a few friends along the way. at night theres a lot of drama
good,"Always Greet every customer that walks through the door with a smile on your face if you are working register"
good,Not sure what to say about this place the management could be better and it should have people who care about their job. The only thing about this place is I met pretty amazing people
good,"I worked there for a little under 4 months. It was awful. The boss was a jerk, the hours were brutal if you're trying to balance school. It was a horrible job"
good,I enjoyed working there. I enjoyed learning to run the cash register and the cooking. the workplace was kept clean and almost everyone did their part.  I did not enjoy how the people gossip way too much.
good,"Responsibilities included sales of all products within the business, checking out the customers in a timely manner. Made sure all customers were aware of all products on sale and they were taken care of with a positive attitude. Stocked, organized and cleaned shelves for the next day’s business."
good,some people really don't care if they do their job right or not they just care about the money and trust me the money is not worth half of what you have to do when no one else with do their part...someone is always out to get someone in some way..manergers don't want to do their hoursor the work for that matter..and the general manager is a joke in my eyes he does absolutely nothing unless he is called over and over about something that has gone wrong and yet he still wont do anything about it till it to late and someone gets hurt
good,"No leeway for family emergencies. Little to no communication between higher ups and regular employees. Little training, some stuff  had to be self taught. Coworkers were sociable. Hardest part was dealing with a large influx of customers alone."
good,"Employees are good, company is good, management is sadly lacking management skills."
good,"great workers and managers but lead manager lets people steal and do drugs."
good,i loved working thier. i wished i had stayed thier.the hardest part of the job was to know how everything worked and making sure it worked right when i first started. i loved dealing with the customers and giving them the service they needed. i loved how i would put a smile on all my customers faces.
good,"Typically, work was great and well delegated; however there was too much ""soap opera"" drama then productivity going on. Overall, I would recommend NuPak But do keep in mind, this is a controlled work environment; If you do not like to be cold, I would not recommend the job."
good,"Workers have to maintain the cleanlinest of the store each and every shift. Co-workers are the best team I have worked with in a long time. Went through three managers in less than a year. Very busy store, always busy and midnights are beginning to build a very good trade. Hardest part of job is trying to keep all the dirt from the refinery at bay. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all the diverse types of people."
good,The Job at Casey's is very repetitious and gets old very quickly. management has little to no regard about your well being or life outside of work and tends to change schedule constantly.
good,"I worked cash register, made pizzas and other food, cleaned store, cleaned parking lot, washed dishes, and dealt with a lot of customers....I also stocked shelves and coolers"
good,Management was very rude at almost all times. Did things everyday to make me mad or want to quit. They would make me stay an hour and a half past when my shift ended at 2.
good,"This is more of a job for teenagers, or those who don’t want to go forward in their career. The store is so small that the manager there rarely gets checked on by higher ups. I have not enjoyed my time there besides the half off pizza I got only during work hours."
good,"A lot of people keep quitting so we don’t have a lot of staff so when you need someone to cover your shift it’s most likely not going to happen. Our management keeps getting switch around, and our manager left. There is just a lot of hopping around with the management right now and it’s kinda dragging the store down."
good,I was there for about 2 years before I quit only because there wasn't a manager at the time. I was suppose to be off at a certain time and the manager that was there temporary wouldn't let me go and get my kids from daycare so I had to stay and work a 12 hour shift that day. Ended up paying extra money to my daycare plus lost my provider because I couldn't pick up my kids.
good,It's an easy job but they had me doing deliveries when my truck broke down and had plenty of others to go to. Management could use a little work but it's okay.
good,The manager of the union store is a complete mess. She is unorganized and makes poor decisions. She flip flops constantly on what she expects and gives zero slack. She is all about pleasing her boss and not about helping her employees. She micromanages to the point of disruption. The store runs best without her around.
good,"People aren't terrible but there's a lot of highschool gossip like anywhere. Some days are busy, some slow. Store manager is biased towards day shift and never works evenings/nights. Nobody does their job properly so everyone gets blamed."
good,would still be working there today if management wasn't so influenced by her former employees. Days went fast cause of fast pace job. Loved meeting new people(customers)
good,"Does not treat employees with respect, managers will not help if your sick with coming into work for you and if they do their very rude. Very unorganized"
good,"stressful environment, but co worker make if less stressful."
good,"Corporate is all about how much money THEY make. Every one is replaceable. Corporate spends too much money building new stores. So they cut store hours during summer holiday weekends. Caseys is the ""Wal-Mart"" of gas stations."
good,"It was enough to keep me busy during down-time while I was nannying for a family member, The job was fine, I just didn't care much for the entire town."
good,"Its a decent temporary job for young adults, but definitely not something you would d want to try to make a living off of. Inconsistent hours and schedules."
good,"A good part time job for supplemental income. Friendly people to work with.  Good management structure, but there wasn't many benefits such as insurance offered."
good,"I have worked there for 3 years, 2.5 in management and it sucks. Never get to see my family. Donut shifts leaves dirty dishes and leave all there dry dishes for you to put up. They leave the day old for you to wrap. Night shift wont stock so when you come in the next day right in the middle of lunch you have to stop so you can restock"
good,"I worked for 3+ years for caseys. The store level management is hindered by the upper above store level management and are inconsistant. The biggest problem is people never want to come to work, which makes everything harder on those who do show up and come in on their days off. I worked in bicknell and the store management is very nice and easy to work with."
good,I didn't really like working at Casey but it was first job and the boss was kind enough to give me a job when i was in need with no experience but it was a poor experience.
good,Management did not always know how to order the truck for what was needed in the kitchen. Always running out of product. I liked working with customers and had some regulars which was nice to see return cause of the customer service.
good,"But the management was terrible. The customers made it the best. Manager had a mouth and if you snipped back, write up. Very controlling but the customers made it worth it."
good,They act all buddy when they need bodies to fill in for the position. Very high turn over rate for every 5 people hired 3-4 would quit within the first week! Was told no nights a few weekends- Quit while I was scheduled for two weekends in a row all nigh shifts!
good,"Typical day at the register includes a lot of cleaning and helping customers and making sure everything is stocked. Management is decent and does occasionally try to help out. Workplace culture seems...a little bit forced. The hardest part of the job is the fact that hours have been cut, and it leaves too little time to do anything. The most enjoyable part of the job is working the management shift and being able to help out the other employees while you're there. The shorter shifts mean you have to be there more often during the week. 35 hours is considered full time. 5-7 day work weeks."
good,"While my coworkers were enjoyable, and pleasant to work with, management does not know how to do their job, or punish employees properly. The schedules are never done without mistakes."
good,Decent job easy to keep busy  fast shifts because it keeps you busy in the kitchen Kincaid il Casey's was very brutal making you do work of 2 or 3 people alone...athens il Casey's was very originized great team work and ran by an amazing manager
good,the management here was awful they never considered the other workers. I always had to work weekends and worked way too much for a full time student so
good,"They expect people to just know what to do, the training is not always the greatest. the turn over rates is high so there are not reliable hours. some managers are unreliable. equipment is always broken."
good,They have way to much drama going on. And I rather work from home so I can be with my children. I just didn't wanna come to a job full of drama and where no one did their job before I came in.
good,Just like Sullivan’s it was a terrible place to work. The managment is so dishonest and just fake. They won’t let you know what ou are doing right but they are quick to point out your flaws.
good,I enjoyed very much working with the public. The team members were great people and I enjoyed working with them. There was a big turnover in management department which was concerning to me. The unloading of the weekly truck would probably be the least enjoyable to me.
good,"The pay was horrible for being a store manager not competitive at all what so ever, not much for benefits either. I liked the group of people I worked with is the reason I stayed as long as I did."
good,May 1989 to Feb 1990. Hired in as asst. manager. Learned everything really fast. Paperwork was easy to do. Worked well with employees I managed. They were good workers. Did what I asked of them. The manager told my Mother I couldn't work there anymore cause I got pregnant so I never went back. Got my unemployment benefits too.
good,working at Casey's if fine for someone who needs a part time job. But working full time without being a manager it is hard to make ends meet. After ins. and taxes i could barely pay my bills.
good,I think if the store was ran by someone other than the person who was in charge then things would run a lot smoother.  The manager there expects you to pick up the slack on everything even her job but refuses to put a helping hand in when needed by others.
good,"Working at Casey's was stressful because the Manager was Mental Unstable which made her decision making totally off the chart., At the end of my tenure ( which was over 3 yrs ) the manager became very combative including, pushing, shoving, screaming, forgetful and blamed me for her mistakes , I  was concerned  for my safety."
good,most of my day is mostly behind the counter making sandwiches and other stuff. I noticed that the cleaning the area was a problem for others and I noticed that i had a problem with their gloves but other than that it was enjoyable.
good,Learned to work with the public. Would wait on customers and stock shelves. Hardest part was no breaks. Most enjoyable part was who I worked with. Very busy but made the day go by fast.
good,"The overall job isn't bad for a first time position, it's general cashier work, stocking shelves, etc. but the work enviroment just isn't the best. A lot of drama between employees and management, you hardly ever get to leave at the end of shift on time, and definitely makes you feel un-appreciated as an employee at times."
good,"Rules are enforced only with certain associates,  not all treated the same.  Manager comes and goes as pleases.  When there are customer concerns with personal hygiene of the associates (beard nets, gloves, hand washing) and manager is informed, nothing resolved with associate.  As a 2nd asst.  Was very frustrated with trying to resolve customer issues and Manager not enforcing rules or having.""ones back"" when enforcing rules."
good,"Casey's would be a fun place to work for, but there is little control, with management there.  Within three months, there were three different managers, and all three ran things differently."
good,"Imagine running an entire carry out pizza store by yourself, that's basically what I did there. Along with daily prep work and dishes, it was a very demanding position."
good,I had overall a good exp at this location manager always there to help great customer service. Always hires employees with alot of exp. Great location stayed busy.
good,"the work itself was very easy and straightforward. the schedules changed, the employees loved  to dump their work on you or just not show up at all. the customers were usually cool though"
good,No advancement beyond assistant manager. Worked too many hours as an assistant for close to nothing. No social life outside of caseys because of always having to be on call.
good,"A typical day of work involved assisting customer needs.  What was learned was different security protocols for that establishment.  Hardest part of the job was the dependability of the new management hired,  The hardest part of the job was getting the work scheduled corrected every week with management, which would conflict with the school schedule.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the crew I would work with on a daily basis."
good,Fast paced environment with a lot of customer contact. Versatility in possible job functions between cashier and kitchen positions.
good,"I have worked with this company for a year and a half with no issues up to this point. I have enjoyed the atmosphere and my co-workers and especially my customers and the relationships I have built within my small town. "
good,"I think this store would be more successful if the workers there took there job more seriously. They need to do there jobs, all of them, and do them right. Its not a hard job but it isnt enjoyable when your coworkers are extremely lazy and you ALWAYS have to pick up there slack."
good,The management is poor and overworked. They leave too much on the shoulders of a simple pizza cook. You don't get to have a life outside of work and the hours suck.
good,loved customers but very poor management benefits were not favorable.Many people never followed instructions. worked lots of overtime
good,i get to work face to face with customers instead of just only communicating via telephone
good,I loved my job at Casey's but I felt like they used me and treated me unfairly.
good,It's an okay job for starting out but not for a long-term career.
good,"I mainly worked kitchen, sometimes cash register, however I preferred kitchen, the customers preferred it when I worked kitchen."
good,"Never have enough crew to implement safety/security for the team. Too many duties for two people to do when you have numerous side jobs to complete. If one is cooking the other is to clean, stock, watch the fuel pumps and that is almost impossible. That's why there are too many drive-offs"
good,"ok to work for, not the best pay but ok for the job you do. you get  insurance available immediately which is a plus."
good,My 2nd part-time job. Wore me out because I am up at 3am. every morning and would start my first job by leaving the house at 5:30 am. every morning and getting back home around 4:45 just enough time to get ready and eat and out the door for my next job at 6:00pm.-11:30 pm. Wore me out for 6 months but the people were awesome and easy to get along with. I was riding on at least 2 hrs. sleep a day. The hardest part for me on the job was constantly mopping floors in rainy and snowy weather. Had to do what I had to do to make ends at the home front meet.
good,"I ran the register, cleaned the store and stocked products. I always kept myself busy. I worked in the town I live in so, it was great getting to see all the people I know."
good,"I went in and either started preparing everything in the kitchen or swap with the cashier. I mainly worked with kids which I got along well with but found out they were there for a paycheck not to work. No part of this job was hard but getting everyone to do their job wasnt always easy. The manager(s) was also good people. They always worked with the employees with needs if we had any. I enjoyed the customers most, of course we always had regulars, but I got along with all of them."
good,"Casey's overall company is mediocre, their ideas are not up to date with today's advancements. They are more concern with shareholders than they are with anyone else.i feel that a first assistant should make more than what they do."
good,"They let me go because of a transfer from another city. Even though I was doing really well and continually got compliments from management and trainers, it wasn't enough to secure my job."
good,"I didn't like the management.  One day they could call off with no doctor note and the next day not show up at all, and still have jobs. Cashiers couldn't do that. If you didn't do something they way they liked they would talk about you like you were back in middle school. They give newer people full time but not the ones asking for it. The ones who always call off or dont show up got better treatment than other pwople."
good,"It was difficult at first trying to get use to communication and fast pace but I thought me what I needed to know about what I want to do with my life, where I fit in and how far I can go in life with a high school diploma."
good,I have worked at three separate Casey's locations and only ever had a problem with the management at the most recent location. It did stink not getting scheduled breaks and sometimes being understaffed but other than that it was a decent job.
good,"Petty and unchecked high level management, an unsatisfactory environment, low pay, more responsibility given as you improve with no compensation increase."
good,The store manager was new. She did not get proper training she lacked professionalism the assistant manager was trying to sabotage the manager and it was just drama. The manager didn't seem to care that I had a family ( two kids under 2) she was only worried about making sure she didn't have to do any extra work!
good,"The management/company do not show their employees appreciation. On the birthdays/holidays, sure the pay is decent but, coworkers don’t receive any acknowledgment or appreciation, when working birthdays/holidays. They don’t schedule you for full time hours, even though applications/interviews clearly state their hours required for full time status, the things promised never came true."
good,"I worked almost 8 years at this company and got fired for having to leave early was told I didn’t get managements approval when I talked to manager 2 weeks prior. So I loved the job just not the manager, I loved and got along with all my coworkers just not the manger. If you can find a good manager it’s a good place to work."
good,I loved my job and my customers. I made sure my regulars had their items stocked before they came in. Management was in-experienced. We worked in a high turn over industry but the job duties where still completed.
good,average for a convenience store hours hours were early and fast past always needing to do more than you have time to do. but hours not enough for cost of living
good,okay job to work at not bad pay horrible management if the store manger did something wrong she just blamed it on everyone else the co workers were very friendly though
good,"It’s a good place to work. Friendly. Outgoing. Very busy place. You get"
good,"Very fast paced environment in the kitchen and at the registers, it's typically a pretty busy store. Good staff, upbeat environment, good place to work if you can be on your feet for long periods of time."
good,"Great family place, but too much drama. Too many things going on at one most the time with little to no people so mistakes were made a lot with everyone on the job."
good,Minimum wage job to work with one other person in a gas station.  Hardest part of the job was making sure everything was completed by the end of your shift.
good,"I worked for Casey’s for almost a year and in that time we had major overturn. There was no manager when I started working for them until another manager was transferred to the store as well as another assistant transferred from a different district. Management was way too relaxed and refused to write people up. Multiple employees would no call no show and not receive any sort of reprimanding. Employees were basically forced to work 16+ hour shifts due to people not showing up and management not covering shifts. Don’t request days off because they won’t bother allowing you to have that time off (funerals, sick time or family emergency’s). No actual breaks since you have to have another employee run register or work in kitchen to receive a break and there were only 2 employees there at a time. They would change the schedule and write you in on your days off without telling you. The only way to find out was to check the schedule every single day. Management won’t answer phone calls and they talk to other employees about your personal life and talk trash about employees. One employee couldn’t find a babysitter and the manager running the store told her to bring her kid in then, she did and the manager told her she couldn’t work with her kid there. The manager basically just didn’t trust her that she didn’t actually have a babysitter and figured she just wouldn’t come in. One employee was given an .18 cent raise after an entire year. Even pregnant women are left alone in their area and have to stand for 8+ hours without a break. The customers treat you like garbage. I had been cussed"
good,"There's no room for advancement, you'll be stuck in the cooler most likely, the people there are going to take advantage of you. Don't work at Caseys."
good,The management was not able to manage the staff's schedules and there were a lot of mishaps that transpired due to overall staff's confusion on who works when.
good,"Casey's was meant to be a local, temporary job for me. It's not a bad place to work overall, what with the good people I usually worked with and flexible(?) hours, depending on your definition of flexible. But for me it was the personal bias I felt from management that pushed me out. Personal issues with a former employee and my current girlfriend carried over to me fairly obviously, and had a legitimate impact on both the hours I worked and how many I received. "
good,"Middle management is the issue in my opinion, mainly because there seems to be no communication between the store level and the corporate level. They tend to promote people that are just in the running for a bigger paycheck instead of promoting people that keep the store in mind. Low level employees have it the toughest while ""managment"" simply attempts to delagate unsuccessfully. Training is minimal and expectations are unrealistic for what they pay. They also tend to hire mid to upper management from outside the company as opposed to promoting from within."
good,"There was not a typical day.  "
good,Very stressful job and management needs looked at in some stores. I don’t honk that some of the managers do their job correctly in fear that they will have to work harder
good,"Not recommended if you are trying to stay away from strenuous activity. Too much heavy lifting, pay not worth job descriptions. Was ok to place to work."
good,"Management was kinda poor, but the staff was wonderful. Everyone worked like a team, with the manager occasionally covering shifts, but always tried to find someone else to work them, even if they worked an eight hours shift that day"
good,"I would recommend this position to anyone under 26 years old. This is definitely not a career choice, unless you enjoy the work and make upper positions fairly quickly."
good,"I was not fully explained that there are no breaks, lunch breaks.  The manager made you find your replacement if you could not attend work even in and emergency."
good,"Inspected and maintained cleanliness of store on a daily basis, cash handling, stocking. Asked to work hours that you are not scheduled for on short notice."
good,"There's so much that could be said, but I'll keep it short. They have little regard for off time, you could be scheduled off, but they tend to last minute change it and not even notify you. Management has low communication skills with employees, in some cases they expect YOU to come in and check your schedule every day, which shouldn't be necessary if the schedule is done properly. Because of this, if they last minute schedule you ( Say, the day before) they likely won't inform you of the last minute change, and then YOU will get in trouble for not showing up for this officially unscheduled shift. There's so much more that happens there, but that's a pretty big one."
good,"Casey's in general is a great place to work if you enjoy being around people, but you better plan on putting in twice the hours required because no matte what they tell you, you will be there way more than they say."
good,"I liked the fact that their was always something to do. Something to clean and stock at all times. Cleanliness was very much so upheld, which is always good to see."
good,"Kitchen work isn't for everyone, but the people who claimed it was for them never showed up for work. I know kitchen work isn't for me but I needed a job and knew I could handle it. Boy was I wrong, nothing like being woke up at 5am on your day off to be begged to come in at 6 and work till close (11pm was close but no matter how long it took you were there until the kitchen was spotless and the cashier had counted out all tills and balanced out the money) after 3pm there was no manager on duty. The orders either poored in like crazy or the night was dead, but either way you were expected to stay busy even if there were no known tasks to see to."
good,"When I worked at Casey's store on North 25th street, I was a cashier most days. Other times I help inventory, unload truck, cleaned various things, including lot and gas pumps.Even took the laundry to the laundromat and washed and folded."
good,"The job is pretty easy, but the hours suck for the pay. Management is pretty good, it could use more structure. I been working there for over a year, and I have not received a raise yet."
good,Management is lazy. The kitchen manager doesn't help. He thinks its his job to do nothing. Over worked and under paid. People don't do what they are suppose to and no one makes them do there job so the person after the lazy person all to do more work
good,"In a month of working there, I had anxiety attacks. I had one training day in the kitchen and was expected to be fine all by myself. I had no experience in kitchen before that and I don't want to go back."
good,"A typical day at work for me at this place consists of people talking about others, and the pizza part is pretty fast paced. I work strictly in the pizza and it is hard for me to keep up sometimes. Somedays i love my job, some days i like it, some days i just want to straight up walk out. i dont because i have bills and kids"
good,"You are required to do a lot of work, if you are not prepared to do that, do not apply. You will be asked to do work as a team member and to help other co-workers."
good,I worked at two different Casey's locations. The first was the best job I had. Great coworkers and management. It was the opposite at my second location
good,I worked at caseys and had fun. It doesnt  pay much but you stay pretty busy and time goes by fast.  Everybody was nice to each other but they had a hard time keeping help.
good,"I've worked many gas stations, caseys actually treats their employees rather decently from what I've seen. Management is a joke, idk what they actually do aside from complain"
good,over all casey's was good place to work but they do not train and treat their store managers well and do not like to pay their manager what they are worth. I got the boot from them because i wouldn't take less than 35 a year to be store manager and the store manager over me that was leaving told me not too because of how much they expect from you. In my opinion they will low ball you to take the manager position or they will offer it to some one who will take less you.
good,"I worked there twice and on my second go around the fired the store manager, when one was being found a fill in was there and hired two new employees for full time while overlooking the employee (myself) that had been asking for full time for 2 months, another example they fired another employee after 8 yrs of devoted service simply because he wouldn't run a cash register due to be dyslexic and the manager was aware of this."
good,If you don’t have a good managment team to lead employees it’s a very difficult place to work. Unfortunately more employees are worried about talking about other employees instead of doing the job
good,"I really enjoyed working at Casey's, but I was working about 60 hours a week and raising 2 children.  The job eventually interfered with my home life and I had to leave."
good,I worked as a cashier and cooking food in the kitchen.  I also helped unload truck and stock the store.  Cleaning was also one of my duties.  Very long shifts.
good,"I enjoyed working with customers, and I really respect my former manager.  I couldn't stand working with some of the other employees. They got away with anything and everything, causing much more workload for others."
good,i loved the people i worked with. however i and others was not impressed with the new boss. the hardest part of the job was making sure all donuts and breakfast food was out and ready when the store opened. the best part of the job was i had the rest of my day off after 9 am. what i learned is that customers are great and they are what make a place work. a day at work...... come in throw out old make new take orders fill orders clean do your dishes and go home.
good,"A typical day at work was fairly decent, I would come in and start cooking, I learned cooking and cashiering, however the management at my store took advantage of their power, and spoke behind the back of everybody, they were racist, sexist, and otherwise uninviting to work for."
good,"Typical day is doing more than your fair share from the last lazy employee.  As well as serving customers."
good,"Casey's is an excellent place to work for a first job.  It offers good experience in a fast paced customer service oriented setting.  However, insurance benefits are poor enough that state offered insurance in much more competitive when comparing premiums, performance reviews are inconsistent and raises may take up to 6 months to process from review dates.  Company policies on attendance are strict with Full time employees having to meet minimum hour requirements by the week or be disciplined.  Higher level management often appears to  ignore concerns of lower level employees including store managers' concerns.  Career advancement is difficult  since only management has access to newsletters.  Store manager's responsibilities have also been increased while lessening the responsibilities of the 1st and 2nd asst. managers."
good,"Casey's has decent pay (at least better than minimum wage) and offers benefits, one can expect at least some variation of work so long as you are willing to learn both register and kitchen shifts. Hours can be flexible but every Casey's I've worked at has been regularly understaffed, especially in the summer months so be prepared for long hours and lots of repetitive work depending on the needs of the store. "
good,"Management is a mess, pay is very low and there is very small chance of advancement despite excellent performance. "
good,"I didn't mind working here, but the management wasn't the best. There seemed to always be a problem with someone calling off or someone just not showing up or the person would show up and not do much of anything on their shift."
good,Not a bad place but there really isn't any room for advancement in this career. It's your typical starting out job. It was nice traveling to other stores to work as you got compensated for the drive time and mileage which was nice. I enjoyed that.
good,"Overall I don't think Casey's cares about their employees.. As long as the jobs get done, even if one or 2 people are doing it all, they don't care and no recognition for your efforts."
good,Lots of work with little pay with few opportunities. Must be willing and be able to work foh and boh positions in order to be a productive part of the team
good,They don't let you defend yourself if they receive a complaint on you at corporate level.  On most days manager ends up working longer than they are required. Most enjoyable part is getting to know yur regular customers.
good,i really liked my job at first. but after a few weeks i started to notice how some of the other employees got treated better then they should. Management has a problem with favoring employees.
good,In the four years of working for the same company I rarely got a raise or any recognition for a good job done. It was always the same thing every day and no room for advancement.
good,Only part time employment was available unless management. No overtime allowed. The customers were very nice and fun to interact with. I got to know a lot of usual customers and form relationships with them making both their quick morning routines easier for them.
good,"A typical day at work involves checking out/assisting customers, cleaning the store, taking out trash, and assisting coworkers with their duties."
good,"Discounts on the food and they pay you a differential if you work nights. You also get raises. There's no place to take a break though. There's always a ton of stuff to do, especially if you're working in the kitchen. Don't be surprised if you leave every day with one or two things unfinished."
good,"i did my job well, learned quickly, enjoyed my job most of the time. My customers always commented on my donuts and pizza I prepared and cooked. hardest part of job was type of customers you get at night."
good,I would rather not work at caseys General store again. I feel as if its a job for a highschool student or someone going to school that needs a 'part time job'.
good,I worked in the kitchen and enjoyed working with the customers. I was responsible for making donuts and food for the store. I made pizza for the store sales and customer orders.
good,"can be a fun place to work, you meet people from all over the USA and the world. They have the best pizza. They try and work as a team in their stores"
good,"A place where there is no room for mistake, have to maintain a professional atmosphere at all times.  Willing to work some crazy hours and split shifts. The company will not pay over time unless an absolute necessity. That is what the manager is for."
good,Customer service money management customer is always correct enviorment. I learned many different ways to resolve a situation with a customer. I loved all my co-workers i got along great with them.
good,I love working with food. So it came to no surprise that I liked to make pizzas and subs. Corporates policies are good but I have worked in 2 states for 4 different stores and the management has been left wanting. Along with the bad management the employees do not follow corporate policies but instead follows their own.  It disgusts me that when word of the area and higher management is coming to visit the store people scramble to get things done that should have been done on a daily or weekly basis. When concerns are mentioned to management it does not get taken care of instead coworkers get upset and angry that something negative was actually said.
good,"Just a typical day starting your shift goes slow usually. Once you clock in and start for the day, you usually have to do your job and the previous shifts job because some of your coworkers have no work motivation and some get behind. As a night shift person, if you get behind and don't get to something, you get wrote up. My managers are great people who know what they're doing but try too hard to be everyones friend. Coworkers are very nice and good people but some have no work ethic and are just plain lazy. They often put you behind if you come in after them. Honestly, there is not a hard part of my current job; everything is easy and super do able. The most enjoyable part of this job in my opinion is stocking soda in the cooler and getting to know the regular customers; really connecting with once complete strangers is a great feeling!"
good,"I do have many problems while working for Casey's. I never got paid on time, the managers were very unhelpful and we were constantly getting new ones. Most of my co-workers were very enjoyable to work with though. Although they were constantly leaving. Another big problem is the schedule, they'll schedule you for Friday on Thursday. They never expect you to actually have a life outside of work. It gets really old and its hard to continue with that."
good,It's an alright job. You will have to sometimes work crazy shifts. Your typical day will be making food or standing at a register. It's mostly part time unless you apply for a management position.
good,"Each day at caseys was different business wise."
good,The only reason I did like working there was because of the people I worked with . Otherwise I did not like my job there at all . We had a manager that was good that cared about us and the company did absolutely treat that manager wrong .
good,"I learned mostly people skills. Its hard to work with so many people in one place and not get irritated, so being able to just brush things off your shoulder were definitely one of the things u need to be able to do. It was an experience but I am not looking to work with people I am an animal person and hope to work full time in an animal related job."
good,"I would have to pull doubles all the time, got called in on the day of my bridal shower and the day before my wedding even thou they were asked for off months in advanced.  Employees never wanted to work their shifts would come to work strung out and lazy.  Poor management for sure!!!"
good,"A typical work day was pretty fast paced, between making pizzas, and dealing with customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the co-workers that didn't do their job correctly and take it seriously. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to smell the pizza."
good,"I was in charge of the cahs register and assisting customer, I was able to enteract with other empoyees as well as the customers. I enjoyed my job, because i was given the opportunity to work with others and make an impact on others day."
good,"The average day the store had the capability of running efficiently when particular individuals were on schedule to work.  Management skills were not so efficient when new management took over, however each employee came to work and showed a willingness to pick up the slack whenever the need had arisen.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction and meeting new people on a daily basis, as well as satisfying the needs of repeat customers."
good,"Depending on what section you were working in you had different responsibilities:"
good,I would like to be a cashier  I like working with the customers. WE have time schedule to get every thing done The coworkers are very friendly
good,"I really enjoyed working at Casey's for the first several months. Things originally were very optimistic. Unfortunately, working there eventually become more stressful and taxing than it was truly worth. I was looking for a full-time job, and that is what I was promised. However, they did not give very many hours, and the schedules were probably random, based on how unpredictable they were."
good,"Each day varied on how the day would go. Your morning customers were always nicer to work with compared to the night customers. Other co workers helped when possible, some more than others, management wouldn't do anything if there were a problem that needed to be handled."
good,"Most days went fairly well. Customers tended to be regulars. There was always something to learn and plenty to keep busy, so the time went by in a hurry. The positions tended toward a rapid turnover however, which made it difficult to develop any strong connections with co-workers."
good,steady paced work environment and great coworkers. everyone liked to crack jokes and make work seem more fun whilst at work
good,Caseys appears do be a decent company to work for.  However the need to pay more attention to the store security rather than being paranoid the employees are going to steal.  All security cameras are pointed directly at employees and none are there for the employees protection. No cameras to aid in catching gas drive-offs.
good,"Made dough, pizza, sandwiches, cashier, clean up inside and outside. Management was nice, co-workers were fun to work with real friendly. Most enjoyable part of the job making different types of pizza."
good,Caseys in general is a great place to work and to find advancement in a career that involves community services. They are very intuitive to customer needs and satisfaction of the products they offer. Unfortunately the store I worked at needs a lot of management help to successfully manage team players and to increase customer services. Most of the employees I worked with had great service skills but the management was found lacking in the support of their employees.
good,Can be a high pace job preparing food for customers. Constently under the scruteny of upper management. I greatly enjoy helping the customers. I do not like having to disciplening employees.
good,"To many changes, no communication. I had fun at times just not where I wanted to work all of my life."
good,I did the same work all the time either on register or working in the kitchen and felt like I was unappreciated.  I always got told I wasn't doing my job. My manager lied to me and talked about other employees when they weren't around. I don't recommend the job to anyone.
good,was not treated right. I missed one meeting and they wanted to use me as a Guinna pig. that is why I walked out. It was all right that he wrote me up but not to punish me more.
good,"Not a bad place, depending on the managment."
good,"The upper management kept changing the rules. The co-worker are good people. My day started at 3:30am every day ended about 1pm, did books, counted cigs, lottery, and money. Did bank deposits, Orders and made sure store was clean and costumers were taken car of. No matter what time of day or night it was if need I would work."
good,"Working for Casey's as Manager was very long hard hours.  I liked the fast pace, it kept me busy all the time."
good,"my typical day at caseys. i went from pizza maker to register clerk in no time, i worked hard and went beyond my duties, i'd run the register all night stock coolers when needed helped pizza maker make pizzas. when we wasn't busy i'd do extra cleaning, counted cigerettes everynight sweep mop and buff floors. i learned alot actually i learned respect and real responsibilties!! management and i had our times but mostly got along i got 2 raises because i worked hard and earned them. the hardest part of the job was putting up with the intoxicated patrons. the most enjoyable was the other people i worked with."
good,"Go to work, do your job, clean, check out, go home."
good,A typical day at work go in take care of customers. How to pretty much do everything i needed to do on my own. Management was horrible. Doing the kitchen by myself with only one night of training. Being around all the people meeting new people and learn how to take to the differnt kind of people.
good,there is no full time employee except the manager. You just stand there and ring people up. Very boring. The pay is bad but for a part time job its ok. If you are looking to support a family its not the job for you.
good,Some members of management were given too many chances and they still could not do their job correctly. Too many chances were given to people who  were not team players.
good,Improvement on employees and management needs done. The younger you are the more likely of being mistreated. However does supply the time off needed for sick days or family things.
good,The reasoning behind this work is sometimes difficult to understand because feedback can be difficult to come by. Days sometimes seem rushed with quantity of counts done preferred of quality of the work.
good,"Management lacks in training and/or experience. Also, management is unprofessional. Very hard to get days off. Not enough pay for the work you do. Be prepared to pick up the slack of others or you’ll be punished as well."
good,I tried my best to work there and be happy but the negative vibe in there was too much. I had to leave. I do miss my customers though. They were the best.
good,"It's a good entry level job, will help build customer service skills. It lacks the proper communication between employees and management. Good for someone who likes fast paced work."
good,"I felt out of place, didn't quite fit in with the rest of the individuals that worked there; however it did make for interesting conversations and getting to know a little about each other."
good,This place is okay if you are a high school or college student or if you are just looking for a part time job.  I would not recommend this company if you are looking for a career.
good,"When i worked at caseys everyone starts out at part time, its a mandatory 30 hours but sometimes is less. You are paid bi-weekly, i was bringing home 300$ every two weeks. A family couldn't make it on that income. You are to wear a read or white t-shirt and black jeans."
good,I enjoyed the experience and it brought me. To learn. New things and take task on i was new to and a deadline that i had to meet. Plus clean my dishes prep for next shift
good,I enjoyed my time at Casey's however i believe the staff we had mad it more stressfull then it needed to be. Had alot of people picking and choosing when and where they worked leaving alot of work load on a few employees willing to step up. In the end i just realised iv given up to much of my home and family life for the company
good,Would have been better if they done right with the crazy stalker guy other then that i enjoyed my job there i loved the people i worked with it is a good environment to work in and friendly peoole
good,"This job is an amazing job, if your willing to deal with people that are either going to be there for only a few months before leaving or getting complaints. Only been there six months, got fired because of too many complaints."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in, checking the register(s), completing a checklist. I learned how to open a store and get it ready for the day. The management was very poor when I worked there and she had favorites and refused to alternate/rotate the staff, as it was promised when I got hired."
good,A typical day at work you would get the coffee going taking care of customers cashing them out. Management was not well at this location always left 10 mins in the shift had her workers doing her whole job. There really wasn't really a hard job but  what I enjoyed the most were my customers seeing the same faces everyday.
good,I loved working with the costumers they became a big part of my life especially the regulars but management there was awful upper management at the most i felt as if they could care less about there workers
good,working for Casey's is great if your looking for something close to home and part time with lots of flexibility in your schedule. The work place atmosphere is usually fun and fast paced.
good,Manager needs to be more of a boss than a friend. Employees walk all over her. Store is a mess and not organized. Ovens are broken and other equipment also.
good,If you want to be treated like a slave then this is the company to work for. You have to do the job of 2 or 3 people. You don’t get breaks so you are on your feet for 9 hours every day.
good,Manager frequently didn’t show up and had often not scheduled enough people to cover roles required to operate normal business. Overall job was not hard. Upper management would leave notes instead of addressing problems with individual people.
good,The environment at Casey’s was very much like a roller coaster. There would be good and bad days. The people that I worked with are great. The management wasn’t so great.
good,"little to no team work. co-workers are catty and lazy, there are constant arguments and finger pointing between the shifts. The store manager was very nice and friendly but I wish she would have put her foot down a bit more on some things."
good,"I had been offered the position of kitchen manager at this specific location. However, I declined simply due to poor management. "
good,My manager there at the time was not that great of a manager I don't feel like she treated everybody fairly and the things that she said that she didn't like was always trashy this and trashy that to me that wasn't very professional. The hours are flexible you can work any shift almost and maybe even work a little overtime benefits not so great pay is not so great either.
good,"I didn’t mind working at Casey’s, but the way certain things were handled or not handled was concerning. I felt like I went over and beyond to help while others took advantage of me doing so."
good,"Management is awful through and through. They seem to hire just anyone to lead an area, even with minimal experience with all shifts. There is zero communication amongst managers and associates unless you are buddies with one of the managers. The store that I work at, even being friends with the manager doesn't help, because the store manager doesn't update the assistant at all. I hear more information about what is going on from the morning shift then the bosses, same goes for the assistant thats where the information they have comes from as well. The company its self has strong values and with proper execution from all Store Area and District Managers its would improve tremendously,however at this point that is just wishful thinking. Just like at any workplace there is drama but with Casey's it is much worse, given they hire any type of worker. That and they seem to favor the lazy ones over the hard working ones that always show up. Personally, I would recommend someone to work with Casey's, just to see that anywhere else no matter how bad, there will be better than Casey's General Store. They made over 2 billion dollars as a whole last year and can't afford to come in and install new cameras that point at the gas pumps to reduce the chances of drive offs or put cameras in the cooler to prevent employees from drinking in the cooler and leaving the opened container just laying anywhere in the cooler. They are looking at the profits rather than customer experience my store alone has had several complaints about the same 3 employees with no repercussions to the employee. Instead,"
good,"Fast paced, little training, might work kitchen twice in a week and then pizza prep for a month and then be expected to do kitchen prep again.  Was not scheduled for more than 33 hours a week"
good,"A typical day for cashier is 8 hour day shift or  4-5 hour shift at night. The job consists of a variety of responsibilities with little time to achieve them. Love my team and co-workers but management lacks communication on all fronts. The job description is confusing because what is expected of some is not of others, so it tends to be unfairly biased towards higher-ups."
good,"It was very dramatic, way more than it needed to be and I didn’t really like that and also they’re cutting hours big time there so I need a new job with more hours."
good,"This job was fairly easy, management team was rude at times. Nobody was ever on the same page, and everyone always wanted to be in charge of.each other"
good,"The management was awful in the sense there was zero recognition for the employees who went above and beyond.  If you weren't kissing their rear ends you didn't get advancements.  Pay was good for that industry, plenty of opportunity for OT and the work was simple but physically demanding at times.  The coworkers and the people in management is what made it awful."
good,It was just a temporary job to get off unemployment until I found a job to further expand my knowledge! I got paid minimum wage for the time being which hurt with bills.
good,"Caseys is good for getting a small check to add on top or a job for if you’re bored, but not something you would want to do for an extended amount of time"
good,It's a good company foe those who are able to not see there family and needed to be on call. Be ready to work every weekend and lots of nights. Love it but I need a set schedule and weekends and holidays are stuck working
good,You clock in and most of the time the person you're taking over for is ready to head straight out the door.  You don't really have any time to get things ready for your shift.  Day shift is usually fully if not extra staffed and night shift usually runs short. You have a crazy schedule that is all over the place.
good,I enjoyed at first but they take advantage of you and put you on whatever shift will free management up they don't listen when you voice concerns and don't really care if you see your family or not as long as management gets their time off. one week id work 70 hrs other id work 95 hrs. I loved it and the people but when I started getting looked over instead of looked at really drove into a wall with this place I loved my coworkers just felt taken advantage of.
good,Some Casey's you have to kiss butt. Some are great to work for. Be careful is you want to advance. If at wrong one they will find a way to get rid of you.
good,"Casey's makes the job of the fuel transport driver much more complicated than it needs to be, and the large number of policies are aggressively and mercilessly enforced. Ambush management is that favored way to dealing with drivers, and they will try to nail you for every mistake without mercy. The pay is quite good, but the corporate culture is pretty toxic."
good,"Learned a bunch. This store was very relaxed as far as policy is concerned which can help and hurt you at times. The company is constantly making cuts in personnel and product quality so sometimes the lack of people on a shift combined with the lack of resources can be frustrating. The people there all try their best but within the rules and policy of upper management, it makes it hard. Some weeks its almost as if the different shifts take it out on eachother in retaliation. Its getting hard."
good,"This generation sucks no one cares about nothing but getting a check"
good,management was great until she passed away and got a new manager. Lack of communication between management and employees. But over all nice company to work for.
good,"This was a wonderful job the first year i worked there, however i went threw two managers in the time that i worked and the company just did not improve. Casey's is know on there fourth manager since the store opened and i am hoping that the work environment gets better. I definitely wouldn't mind going back to work for casey's in hopes that things are done how they are supposed to be done. Me and the second manager that i worked for did not get along in the end, which was a big part of why i left the job but because of that not very many opportunities were there for me, i only made it up to shift leader and was offered kitchen manager but never was offered the training to do so. My favorite part about working at casey's where the people, i enjoyed the people who came in and talked to me and told me about there day and all the wonderful things they had seen and done and i absolutely loved my coworker they were great and very helpful when help was needed."
good,"I enjoy working with most of my fellow co-workers. The thing that i like most about working for Casey's is that we stay busy so time goes by pretty fast. The thing that bothers me the most about working for Casey's is that the pay is not livable by itself, you almost always have to have another job in order to make ends meet."
good,Fast paced environment with lots of people skills needed. Fun to see regulars and work with others I liked working there . Friendly good employees made it a nice place to work
good,"Needs to hire assistant managers that are good with fellow employee's and managers that will do something if there's a problem that is brought to their attention between the assistant managers and the other employees, such as purposely trying to get employees under them fired and admitting it to relatives/fellow peers of the coworker who the assistant manager was trying to get fired."
good,I worked here for half a year and it was very stressful.  Busy store and the manager wanted to be friends with her employees so people got away with stuff.
good,"A typical day at work while employed here was being constantly on the move. Running the register, cleaning, making sure all customer needs were met to their standards, etc. Nothing was really too hard about the job itself. It was just not a pleasurable work environment."
good,I’m not really sure what to talk about In section.  The pay would be good for someone just out of high school starting out.  But it’s just not for me.
good,constant fear of certain staff talking to the boss about any tiny mistake. two-faced and catty employees some were really nice but others were never on time showed up hungover and talked about drinking/drugs at work.
good,busy days I leaned how to do payroll and scheduling and ext. I was a manager. I was very busy all the time and never had time to just stand around. the harest part of the job was getting employees to do there job. the coustomers were the best part about the job
good,I like working there but some of the stuff that goes on there not just with employees but customers also isn't for me I don't like the way management handles things..
good,"Most people would slack off and not get the tasks they were assigned done.  Therefore, the person following had to do their clean up and do all the duties for my shift.  Kitchen should be clean when night cook gets there, not a messy pig sty."
good,"Casey's was fast paced. I took orders, prepped and prepared pizzas and ring pizzas up to our customers. At the end of the day I did the dishes in kitchen, clean appliances, swept and mopped. On Monday's we stocked the whole store. I enjoyed making pizza; I learned a lot about making pizzas. The only thing I was not fond of was the few customers we got daily that were really rude."
good,It was a great place to start working if you are new in town and needing to make some money to pay bills.  If you live in a small town you have no chance of advancement due to the management have been in then position for the longest time.
good,"Make Pizza "
good,i didnt really care to much for some of the people that worked with me i did my job and plus other peoples i think if they got paid to do the job and didnt do it
good,Never a typical day or consistent schedule.  Changes daily.  Management not real friendly.  Team members usually not willing to help each other out.  Must find your own replacement if you are sick.
good,"Every store is different, however the one I worked at had terrible leadership. We we're never keeping up with the policies that were expected and had terrible scheduling and staffing issues. Very stressful, and would not work for the company unless it had guaranteed professional leadership with experience!"
good,"Horrible training, terrible management, a lot of drama, back biting, even from manager, she would talk about employees with other employees and customers, and yell at employees in front of whole store, manager can be very rude, unreliable schedule and days off, manager will not help fill in and is lazy and so are a lot of employees, very unclean, store not kept up. Lots of harassment and head quarters does nothing"
good,Casey's general store was a good place to work. They had fair wages. It was fast paced and busy place to work. The kitchen area was clean and fun to work in.
good,Very fast paced and busy work schedule. Bad thing is you're the only one in the kitchen and the pizzas orders keep coming non stop. Can be understaffed most days and you have more job tasks to complete than what you're able to in your shift
good,great for a temporary job and young person wanting part time work. The management is poor. Hours are good and pay is more than minimum wage but raises are not good.
good,Corporate would change how things were done very often and increase the standard they expected from each worker while cutting hours creating a stressful work environment
good,"I would wait on customers and also cook food. I learned to make pizza's. The management was nice, I was just not getting enough hours. The hardest part about this job was probably making the pizza's perfect. The most enjoyable part about this job were the customers. I got close with all my customers who came in everyday."
good,"I make sure the store is clean for customers to come in and get what they need. It gets very busy throughout the day, but I love almost all the customers.I learned how to provide good customer service and learned patience where I had none. The workplace culture is usually pretty good as long as people do what they are supposed to. I love interacting with the customers and just talking to people. If I can make someone laugh or smile and continue to smile as they walk to their car, my day is made. I love it. The hardest part is keeping everything clean for customers and that is only because we get so busy that it gets hard to do all of that."
good,"I highly recommend not working here. If you do, plan on getting another job soon because even though the job's easy to do, it's not worth the stress.."
good,Casey's is a place to be if you like to be around people every day. its good to have regular customers and get to know more people in your community. i recommend Casey's
good,I really liked working there. Everyone was really nice. I just love customer service with passion.  It is something I have always been great at. Just management was very shaky.
good,"Working there is great as long as the turnout isn't too horrible. People working their own shifts and not calling out randomly, causing stressful situations for other members."
good,"Wasn't flexible with scheduling after the first two weeks. During interview was promised weekends off since i have my son on the weekends. breaks were short. No drinks in the kitchen even if the overall heat is 110 by the stove, which you dont move from on a busy night."
good,Involuntary leave when they wrongly accused me of having intercourse with another employee in the coolers while I was pregnant with my only child! Then refuse to listen to my part and removed me from the work place! Still having complications with this store
good,It may have been just the caseys I worked at but it's to stressful for such an easy going job. You make pizza sell drinks and other items. And for some that's just to hard .
good,It helped pay bills but they wanted you to work a lot even if u had a family. The boss that i had didnt seem to care very much about the employees and their families.
good,It's a fun job to have and it pays well. You learn how to cook the pizzas and how to run the cash register. It's a job that you have to have a cool head for.
good,"Casey stores are a great place to work as ling as they have adequate management. They do provide breaks, lunches and discounts to employees along with free drinks on clock. It is usually a great environment and help train if you do not know something."
good,The store I worked at was open 24 hours a day and 7 days a week so it stayed pretty steady and busy at all times in there. It is definitely a fast paced job with lots of responsibilities to perform and complete each day.
good,"Fast paced, set schedule, very limited on opportunities to advance, have to be full time to get benefits, typically promotes based on seniority."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty normal and went by pretty fast, however, the management was not great and the staff was not either.  Hardest part of my job was having to deal with other peoples work everyday because they did not. Most enjoyable part of that job was getting to interact with the customers."
good,Good work environment. Friendly staff. It is fast paced but no too bad. Good with working with you if something comes up and you cannot make it in for your shift.
good,"Ive worked at Casey's for about 6 months now, and overall the work is pretty easy and self explanitory. One of the big downsides to the store i work at is the head manager. She would clock in and leave the store to do whatever she wishes, and would call the store and have someone clock her out when her shift ends. She makes other employees do her job, and let mostly everyone get away with everything.  Even customers have complained about her never being there. "
good,Everyone was pretty nice once they got to know you however many were standoffish until you have been there for awhile because the turn over rate was high
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers.  It was very fast paced so there was no idle time, which I like."
good,Not a place for a single parent with no help. Would love to go back if they could work with a single parent with 2 kids under 5 years of age. Other than that its a good easy fun place to work.
good,"Job  was ok but turnover rate was very high ,people were always late to pick up shifts without calling.manager would bately cover shifts and most days you get no breaks."
good,"The environment is nice. The customers are really sweet. My coworkers are great, they make work fun. Management could use a little push. Hardest thing about the job is watching my hours get cut when i am great worker while people who dont do much are getting the hours."
good,"I'm not happy with my pay,lack of advancement, or the way co-workers are not penalized for not doing their job or for not showing up. I've been there 3 years and have put my life on hold to cover people many times. I just need to be paid what I deserve."
good,"Would just make food was stocked all day"
good,"the job starts out ok then ,you are choosing weather u have a family or keep your job."
good,It was nice to work with other students however management was unwilling to allow students time off for finals and to study. advancement was almost not possible.
good,must be available 24 hours. work for people who cant make it in and take on all the tasks of running the store. loved my employees just a lot of work for little pay.
good,"It is very close to home. Nice people i worked with, some days went by quick depending on the customers. However there were some days in which it felt like you were their for 4 hours and it hadn't even been 30 minutes."
good,"All in all good company to work for if you have the right manager."
good,"Very busy place. Lots of customer service needed ."
good,"This was my first job, and it was okay for a little bit, but after a few months, things just got sloppy. The employees were rude and disrespectful. They would argue and yell at you while you were helping a customer. I was left quit a bit working the register, and helping in the kitchen, because the manager didn't schedule enough people or there was no calls, no shows. It was horrible. I would never  recommend anyone to work there. Granted, not all Casey's Stores are like this, but the one I worked at was terrible."
good,"I love my job, I start at 6 am and get done at 3pm.  It is trying at times but hey what job isn't.  I start my day out either on the Register or back in the Kitchen (which I love).  Most days consist of running around filling and stocking things.  Making sure everyone in store is good to start the day."
good,"The overall quality of work was good. It was easy to keep busy, and they were very flexible when it came to life issues, like the birth of our first child! The pay is HORRIBLE for the amount of responsibility placed on each individual employee."
good,"Typically I would start my day At 8am and work until 4pm.I would start my day by making ""warmer"" pizzas and breakfast food. Making the pizzas was definitely my favorite part. Stretching the dough and tossing it up in the air until I get the size pizza I need. I thought of making a pizza like it was my art work. Adding toppings to the pizza along with the cheese. If I had to pick something about my job that I didn't much enjoy it would have to be dishwashing. It was always nice talking to my coworkers and customers. We would have so much fun joking with one another and being professional at the same time."
good,"Caseys can be very fast pace and changing with the times. There is always something to be doing or preparing for. Most of the co workers are great. The hardest part of working for Caseys is never knowing when you may be fired. The greatest part is the customers. For the most part, the customers want what they want when they want it and it is great being able to provide that service."
good,"Day to day operations were consistant, was very enjoyable to meet new people daily. Learned everything from kitchen duities to full store operation and management skills. Worked beside many great co-workers."
good,"Low pay for the hours and job requirements of an assistant store manager. With an extensive management background, an employee would think advancement would be possible. At this Caseys I was told advancement was very hard to come by."
good,"this company does not look out for the wage earning workers very well at all, When an individual wage employee that has have worked for Casey's General Store for 15yrs and they are just now making 10.00 dollars an hour, this is pitiful, SHAME on Casey's. They barely start out over minimum wage."
good,"I think the best aspect of working at Casey's was the ability to meet and interact with all the people. The people I was employed with were eccentric and hard working, they are excellent at assisting one another. A typical day included selling promotional items, those changed monthly, and assisting customers with any problems or issues that arose while they were on the property. The hardest part of the job was beginning and realizing there was no formal training from management. Once I was able to adapt and I began to understand the system, it became a good employment opportunity."
good,"No full time with benefits, only p.t. available with no benefits"
good,Doing my job the way I trained and other employees marking I did not so they would look better to the manager.
good,A typical day at work would include interacting with customers making new friends while getting the job done. Management worked with the employee on the schedule and was understanding. Co-workers were decent to work with and helpful.
good,"I would go to work clean my hands, stock the coolers make dough and than start making pizzas that were ordered. Towards the end of the night I would clean the whole entire kitchen. Sweep, mop, and than buff the floors. Make sure everything was ready for the next day. I learned to work really fast and how to make customers really happy. The Co-workers were alright. I usually had to pick up after them and work extra because they would never show up to work. The Hardest part about my job was working until midnight going home doing homework than waking up at 6 to work out than get ready for school. The most enjoyable part about my job was when I  got to work out side and get the store ready for the holidays."
good,"After clocking in, I would head to the kitchen to get the ovens heating up for the shift. Uncover and make sure the prep table was stocked with pizza making ingredients. Prepare dough to be made into pizza's also prepare food to be put into the rotisserie. I would also take customer phone calls and complete their orders in a timely fashion. At the end of the shift, extensive cleaning was performed to the work station, as well as all of the utensils used during the shift. As the cashier, I would prepare my folder for my daily transactions and log-in to the system with me being the cashier, so the totals for my shift can be accounted for. As customers would enter I would greet them, and assist them if so needed. I would also ring up customer items to be purchased with the exchange of money being carried throughout each transaction. "
good,"I went in at 3am to make donuts and all the breakfeast food. I learned how to run a donut robot. my manager was fun to work with. I got along with most of my co-workers, there was no hard part of my job."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but it closed down.  Loved learning the ins and outs of management."
good,My responsibility is providing fuel for the stores in my region.  
good,"A typical day is answering phone calls, taking orders, making pizzas and keeping my kitchen clean and organized."
good,"Working here is ok but needslots of improvement. Lots of talking behind backs, (everywhere) I just keep to my own business. There needs to be more incintives for those employees that go far beyond their duties to cover the slack of the lazy employee(s) before their shift. Cahiers need to be retrained by 1 person, we all have been trained differnt ways of doing things by many people., not all of us know how to use all functions on computer, not all on the same page. Group training maybe??"
good,I started out there as a cashier but within 3 months I was the asst.manager. I enjoyed it and it just came natural to me :)))
good,"A typical day for me was arrive at 4am, help the donut maker for the first hour, than I would count and varify the safe, get the drawer ready for the opening of the store at 6am. I would take all money to the office along with paperwork. I would count and secure all money by 6am. At 6am I opened the store, ran the register until my morning person arrived at 7am. I than went back to office finished with money and paperwork. This would take me until about 10am. I than ran to the bank to do the deposit, and pick up any changed needed. When I returned to store I would secure the change I brought back if any, Then I would help the kitchen person get lunch rush taken care of, by this time its 1pm, I would do ordering and recieving of vendors. The day would end about 3pm. The hardest part was getting there so early in the morning. The most enjoyable part was working with the public and the fast pace."
good,"Prepare food for warmers and customer's orders, run cash register, clean up duties, stocking shelves and coolers."
good,This job was pretty good enjoyed being around the customers. Would have been better if I could have been there longer.
good,Good company to work for.  Has a benefit package that is satisfactory.  Paid holidays and flexible hours to fit most peoples lives.  Chances for advancement within the company if you desire to persue this.
good,"Job opportunity, many different areas to work. Need more team players to work together. Flexible schedule, early morning hours are the best. Unload trucks and putting merchandise away"
good,"Pizza is good. Hours are good, customers and other employees are rude. And you have to just smile and not let it bother you, and drink your misery away, when you get home, wishing you would of went to college and been someone,  instead of that pizza guy at a gas station."
good,"I worked at Caseys general store for a short time before moving into the city and the work experience served me well. Things like baking, delivering, stocking and more gave me an overall intermediate skill set in most jobs I could achieve afterwards with quick learning skills."
good,"My store was understaffed and manager would never discipline the evening and nightshift people for not doing their jobs, so I always felt overwhelmed at work because I was constantly picking up everyone's slack and my manager never seemed to care no matter how many times I'd tell her about this issue."
good,"Manager says only paid to work 45 hours.   Makes you find your own replacement if you try to call off sick. Refused to allow me to use family medical leave when my son was in the hospital very unexpectedly. Sometimes a very good place to work, sometimes not. Like my job and customers which is why I have stayed 10 years, but rate of pay is not enough to live on."
good,"Working as a cashier I had to clean my areas in the store, cash customers out greet them, make sure the equipment was prepared and ready for the morning shift. Sometimes went smoothly sometimes was horrible"
good,"Overall easy work, fast paced environment. I feel there are double standards for everyone. Good workers are expected to work harder and lazy workers and let to slide."
good,"Has a high turn over rate and a new store manager. Otherwise a good place to work. Very friendly employees, very easy going job. Constantly busy, always something to do."
good,"Actually met one of my best buddies here, definitely good people. Management is great. Just goes to show some managers actually valyue their employees. Kitchen gets very busy sometimes, but the tips arent bad"
good,Anyone over the age of 18 can come in and performe all of the dutys that are asked with little training. It is an easy and friendly enviorment to work in.
good,Has been a great place to work over the years however the past few years with new leaders at the corporate office and many policy and training updates have been overwhelming. The cutting hrs to bare bones while my stores bottom line is bigger then ever is beginning to break my motivation and commitment. I hope something changes before its too late considering i have spent 11 years growing with this company.
good,"Always working over, not paid enough, and not very good management. You can hardly get a day off even if you're sick. Over all it isn't a horrible place to work, but it isn't very great and it is super stressful. I do enjoy my co workers."
good,"Being a manager for any company is a hard job. It's constant struggle to keep staff, keep moral up, keep the store running properly, keep it stocked but not have too much product, deal with all the vendors, among other things. I love my customers and my long term employees. They are the reason I've stayed at my position so long."
good,"It's a show up and clock in kind of job.  The station is on an outward traffic artery from downtown Omaha, straight to I-80.  Indigents are a bit of a nuisance but otherwise fairly standard for a gas station."
good,"It's a decent job if you want to work in a gas station and kitchen. The shifts were rough because they always made we work different hours, never a consistent schedule"
good,the store i work with is good. the staff not so much. the customeres were awesome. kept busy for the most part. store was kinda unorganzied for the most part.
good,Do not expect for everyone to perform the same tasks as you despite having the same job title. Favoritism or ignorance abound when trying to bring critical issues up with any management.
good,I worked there for over 9 years and when I put in my 2 week notice they let me work 1 of those weeks so they could get their bonus checks out then they dismissed me for not doing my job. And took my bonus check away from me. I always did my job the same as I did for over 9 years. I also received a medal and a certificate for job well done.
good,I enjoyed working in the food industry all of us coworkers worked a team I really enjoyed the atmosphere because everyone had a positive attitude and smile on there face.
good,this store the second manager and general manager was racist. The managers were let go after I left and the new general manager took over. I did go back as customer and new management was pleasant.
good,"The management needs to go back to management school. Otherwise, it is a good place to work. I enjoyed getting to know my regular customers. That is the only thing I miss about the job."
good,Its not a hard job per say but it is attention demanding since your cooking for people so if you mess up its on you.Really the only downside to this is that customers often can cause the most stress from the guy who comes to pick his order up like a second after placing i.This can be a very big issue since many customers will try to be more rude if they can tell that your irritable it will likely only cause them to try harder.
good,"I get paid okay for what the job is, but the corporate system is broken and the people making decisions can't see the overall effect, only their bottom line."
good,"The hardest part of the job was rush for lunch, my store was right next to a campus so lunch and weekends were difficult. I had to deal with drunk 20-something year olds constantly stealing or fighting."
good,Im always having to fix issues that someone didn't do. The kitchen is usually a mess when first walking in. Lack of communication. The pizza is really good and we try to have warmers out every chance we receive.
good,"Good good please to work good food fast good breaks ,people , I liked my boss she was the one for the job, she was nice friendly people and she was a hard worker"
good,"This job was my first management job. It taught me alot about how to manage and run a company and also help run the teams of people that make up a company. It taught me about the amount of work and time it takes to manage a company and what all goes into that. I learnd how to deal with money, vendors, and employees all while also fine tuning my time management skills."
good,"No other job compares to working with this company. I've had to opportunity to meet and work with amazing people, which is the reason i continue working here."
good,"The particular location I was at had a pretty subpar manager that was friends with enough of the town that it didn’t really ever get addressed. The company has a lot of potential and I would gladly go back, assuming it’s a different location"
good,"Good job overall, just wish they cared more about their employees. If your just out of high school and need a decent paying job Casey's is a good place to go. I'm starting a family and need better pay."
good,"In my experience, Casey's can be a great place to work depending on the managment you work with. Some locations are better than others. Big towns are better"
good,My manager was to close with some employees. A lot of favoritism but I was treated nicely and respected. I got along with everyone. Caseys is a good store overall just working there or anywhere there is always some kind of problem
good,Great first job when your in high school. I wouldn't recommend anyone who is looking to start a life outside of mom and dads house.Its an easy job if  you make the pizzas.
good,The management was decent and being busy made the work day go by fast. The hardest part of the job was that at lunch time it would get extremely busy so at times it was hard to keep up but once you figure out how to do things it wasn't too bad
good,"Don’t know if it was corporate policy or not, but when I gave my 2 week notice, I was immediately removed from the computer and had to click in as generic cashier and my hours were removed."
good,"Employees are very nice, but management is poor in most areas. Their dress code is very strict and professional at all times. Vacation time is decent, insurance is expensive."
good,"Its always crazy busy.  In a 8 hr shift you're lucky to get a 15 min break.  You do get half price food while you're working, if you can find the time to eat"
good,"I mostly worked day shift making doughnuts, breakfast and lunch. It was constant moving, which I liked but when others do not do their job, I have to try to get done what they did not and it makes it even harder. I did like my job but there was no advancement, not enough positions and due to management."
good,The job itself is simple enough and quick paced enough to keep you busy and productive but the people at my particular store were difficult to work with and there was really no place for hard workers to advance.
good,"It was a good temporary job for me.  It's not a typical job I would want to do full-time; but it helped to make ends meet, which is why I got the job in the first place."
good,The management wouldn't work with me on anything or on the hour and half drive had to close every night and my wife worked also and only had one car.they treated every employee differently
good,genuinely not a terrible place to work it can be quite busy and chaotic at times sure but we have good fun. The two biggest problems i have which are probably due to poor management. the first being that no matter what my store manager never seemed to understand how to schedule me when i went to school such as scheduling me till midnight on a school night when i have to be up at 5:30 am the next morning. the second being the managers fixation on trying to be as cost efficient as possible by not hearing people when needed or even as far as running out of supplies from not ordering enough every week for the past 4 months. not even just little things either like im talking out of cheese and pizza dough at a pizza shop.
good,"Would constantly have to work off clock as they will not pay overtime. Make a mistake....go ahead, I dare ya. They have no mercy. I was there 7 years. Training on books. Put wrong number in wrong line. FIRED??????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Was devastated. They did not even try to understand!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,loved helping costumers out and cooking pizzas and making subs for costumers and working the register and getting to know the costumers. I also cleaned up before my shift.
good,"the hardest part of the job was trying to memorize the ingredients that went on the pizzas that people or customers would order, I also missed being able to run a cash register, because that's where all of my experience is"
good,"Must be able to be on call 24/7. Supervisors are in charge of hiring and firing of assistants in store. Unless they do hire assistants,  you face a big chance of working 7 days a week for months without a day off while the supervisor gets every holiday and weekend off. "
good,"Make Pizza, stock the cooler, cut veggies, make finger foods. Hardest part of the job is making pizza and making them in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part is when we get to go home."
good,"A quick paced environment, hardest part of the job is just making sure every customer leaves satisfied. I learned that time management is your best friend!"
good,"Always cleaning up after people, constantly mopping the floors around soda area and wipping off counters. Some people would get rude with you if you didn't give them what they wanted. Handling money and always iding for cigarettes and beer. The place definitely changes you."
good,"I loved working for caseys, If it wasn't for management I'd have been there a long time, This manager was not only a gossip and using substances that are illegal, she refused to hire a man based off of physical deformities, Was always late, and gossiped about a fellow employees autism. She was sleeping with one her employees and when it was discovered by her higher ups she made him quit."
good,"The store managers need more control in their store. The policies are so strick they don't take into account for life and all that may happen.  Donate your left over food. There are so many families out there that are struggling with three incomes just to have 100 dollars for groceries. You could offer half off on all out timed products, use all your donuts for day olds (you'll be amazed how quickly your day old sales will go up). Give any and all emergency personnel and all veterans free coffe, or free 20oz drink. They deserve our support, they put their lives on the line for us. We need to show our appreciation.  Your company doesn't build and thrive without your employees, especially the ones in the store, and your customers. So many people quit because of the managers, not the job. We can love our job and be brought down by our manager."
good,"associate, cashier, kitchen, cleaning, being friendly to customers, making sure product is on shelves, easily found, making orders, changing out soda bibs"
good,"Working at Casey's was physically demanding and stressful.  Even when working seven or more hour days, breaks weren't guaranteed. The pace was either incredibly rushed or slow to the point of boring with very little middle ground.  The management wasn't very responsive to employee complaints, and a lot of the customers were rude to the employees.  Some days, the job felt very rewarding and enjoyable, but they didn't happen often."
good,Its a good average for full time irs not too bad part time you have no hours barely.. But management is great and they train you amazingly! They work well with you.
good,"The best part of the job was the customers.  Most employees seemed to be very negative.  Management, even at the corporate level, never seemed to have cohesive communication which caused chaos at the store level."
good,if Someone didn’t have money. They left there stuff and left. One day someone got mad cause I didn’t have money to help him pay for it. Then I told him I couldn’t do that. It’s my job on the line.
good,"If you ever wanted to be on an assembly line and witness what it was like to have none of the benefits, then this is the high school job for you.  Management was fantastic to work with and did try to work with you when they could, but my co-workers were hit or miss depending on how busy or cold it was."
good,"Working in Casey's is much like any other gas station job. Customer service and keeping a close eye on the ever changing schedule. If you want hours someone is always willing to give up their shift, but often this just screws you over."
good,"The atmosphere is generally relaxed. Most shifts only have one other employee, either on register or in the kitchen. Quality of life at this job will greatly depend on the manager of the month (high turnover rate even among managers)"
good,"Unfortunately the manager was young and inexperienced. A few of the employees were very unprofessional as well. Other than that though, the job went fine. When I started working it was understaffed so that was stressful."
good,Amazing people to work with. Lots of available work hours. Fun time when it is slow. Prepping can be fun if you work with the right people. Jobs are distributed evenly
good,"Overall, if you are looking for a job that pays decent, this is the place. The chances to move up get smaller as you go further. There is a lot of politics involved if you wish to move further. A lot of people get higher positions simply because of who they know, not if they are qualified for the job, leaving those who actually are qualified, like myself, out to dry."
good,Overall it was a fun place to work however it was slow 90 percent of the time and there wasn't a whole lot to do during the day - the people who work there are very fun to be around and have positive attitudes
good,It is an ok job but don't plan on moving up or getting big raises. Training is poor. Blames you for not knowing things you were never trained on. Lot of finger pointing.
good,The store I worked at made you work full time hours with only part time benefits/title. They wouldn't advance me to full time with a bs excuse and made me work over forty hours even without the promised benefits of a full time worker for over ten months. I plan to transfer to another Casey's but they are only offering part time and I am afraid of being put in the same cycle.
good,I enjoyed being around all the different customers and the many conversations that we had. I learned how to handle customer complaints and to work with them to make their day better.
good,"The job it self is GREAT! It's the management that makes it impossible to work there.I love stocking,cleaning making pizza just about anything there and if it wasn't for the manger i would stay there for longer."
good,"I got to meet a lot of different people coming into the store at different times of the day. I was a cashier/associate, just helped keep the wait time low and kept the store clean, coffee made"
good,"Very easy job with no benefits, unless you are full time. Very easy to do. Coworkers are decent but not the best. Pay isn't the best but is what you would expect from a gas station"
good,"Working at Casey's General Store I met a lot of great people, and learned a lot, though the job was very stressful in different ways. The most difficult part of the job was when somebody would call in, or not put effort into completing their tasks. Working in the kitchen, the kitchen manager was great, though the main corporate managers were often rude and disorganized. A typical day consisted of taking orders, prepping and preparing food, and cleaning. The most enjoyable part about working for Casey's General Stores was being able to become friends with your coworkers, and working together."
good,I loved the job when I first started and the job itself is great. Management is the area that needs a lot help and is the MAIN reason as to why I quit.
good,I would have enjoyed this job a lot more if I would have had better training to do my job. There were some people I worked with who literally berated me in front of a customer for not knowing something because I had not been trained on it.
good,For being new to a small town and this being my first job in a new place they were very helpful and understanding.  The shift I worked on was great as I enjoyed the crew on that shift.
good,"Confirm numbers from previous shift correct."
good,If the crew works together and gets things done than it is a very good place to work at and tasks are very simple. Unfortunately my store has horrible management and a very lazy crew. If it wasn't for bad management then I would enjoy my job a lot more
good,"Some regional managers are the worst, but if you get a good one you will know it, just do your job right and everything else is like a breeze, but if you BS and play around you wont have it so easy."
good,"It heavily depends on the day. In my experience one day everything is running smoothly, the next day it felt like the world was ending. Management was very slow to respond to issues found in the store, sometimes issues were never addressed. Unclean environment. Management views you as disposable, if you are not available at all times to work, then management will make your work experience awful. The workplace is very passive aggressive. Issues that should be discussed in person are often given to employees in the form of angry text messages and angry notes left at work. It felt very unprofessional. Overall, very unimpressed with management and the lack of professionalism shown."
good,"The work was easy, the shifts were short. Shifts could be worked around doctors appointments but most weekends needed to be filled, pay was not enough to survive  and the management played favortism"
good,"•	My role at Casey's was to be a cashier from open to close. I also was a cook in the kitchen, placed orders, made doughnuts and dealt with daily customer needs. Lottery, alcohol and tobacco sales, and general merchandise were sold."
good,"Good company to work for. Autonomous working environment as a manager....flexibility in decision making for best interest of store, employees, customers and community. "
good,Difficult because many people don't show up for work... however the job is very easy. Not sure why people don't show up. Get discounts on food while on the clock.
good,Caseys General Store was a fun but professional job to work at. I learned a lot about Customer service and  how satisfaction of customers was very important. I learned a better understanding of checking in and keeping up with inventory. Management was very understanding and helpful and helped employees out however they could. The workplace was fun and upbeat and everyone thought in a manner of making things better for each other as a team. In my opinion the only hard part about this job was the flexible schedules I had to endure. There were quite a bit of times where i would close the store at 11 pm at night and then be back at work at By 3 am the next morning. The most enjoyable part about the job was the team we had they made everything more enjoyable by being positive and helpful.
good,It's very stressful. The more you learn and the better you are at it the more they expect you to pick the slack of all the slacks. They set there and tell you your qualified and they want to move you up and they start showing some of the inventory training and all. But then they skip you and promote someone who doesn't deserve the job and the manager who did even says the same thing.
good,The job itself is quite easy to learn if you apply a little knowledge. The manager could do better with ordering store supplies as the store frequently ran out. The environment feels secure to work in at least. Hardest part is probably dealing with customer service complaints as in some cases its revealed they lied about something but still receive compensation. Most enjoyable part of the job is working the night shift and fixing up the store.
good,There were times I had to work more then seven days in a row. They couldn't keep staff and I never had the same shift. I would go from an10 am to a 4 am then to the night shift. I never had a weekend off even though I was told during the interview I would.
good,"Typical day at work wasn't so bad, I have learned that you can not let your manager get you so much. Management was the worse they don't listen to what you have to say at all. The best part about the job is that when you customers tell you that you are doing a great job."
good,My first job after moving to the US. I learned how to hire and fire. Most enjoyable were my customers. Hardest part - to fire employees .
good,Corporate  is very thoughtful of employees. Some days r harder then other s depending on how busy u r. But it was an all around OK place to work
good,I enjoyed the people I met and my co-workers but to small of a place to much drama. work days where layed back and enjoyable. Managment was not the best very bias and would not fix probelms.
good,I loved working for caseys and i loved my job there just wasnt any opportunity to go any further with that company i need a job with a chance to advance my career.
good,I would not say that for all of Casey's but the management sticks together no matter what the sales associates say.this Job has its pros they do train you before letting up go on your own register.
good,"Work is constant and you often have more work than you can handle on your own, with no helper provided. Must shift between very hot and very cold settings."
good,"Overall the job itself was actually very simple. I enjoyed making and prepping the food and eventually worked my way up to being able to do every job besides the management position. Unfortunately the cons of the job outweighed the bad. The constant turnover meant I was working longer hours and with lower quality workers. The company itself ended up ""misplacing"" some paperwork and it cost me 2 weeks worth of paid vacation. Overall it would be a good summer job or one to get you on your feet but nothing worth it long term."
good,Long hours but overall fun. Management was caught stealing money so management wasn't that good. Co-workers were fun to be with and the regular customers that you see was always the highlight of the day.
good,"Im always working evening kitchen shifts and it's way more work then register. The afternoon and morning people do very little cleaning, even though they always have more staff then evening shifts, and just make the sloppiest messes. Management is terrible and nothing ever gets done unless you do it yourself. I personally hate caseys, but its a job and better then fast food, but could be a lot better if the employees all helped clean."
good,"While working at Casey's, At least the particular one i was at, Management was incredibly sloppy...inventory wasn't accounted for very well. Projected sales made no sense...and wasted product was nearly never accounted for."
good,"Co-workers are very supportive and fun. Learned how to handle small amounts of money. Management is strict, when present."
good,Fun work place with opportunities to advance. Shifting schedules good for single people with no kids. Good beginner job. Schedules are not constant. Call ins happen frequently. You may not be trained for everything during your training period.
good,"Always busy with customers or cleaning."
good,"I enjoyed working at Caseys.  I helped make pizzas, take calls and orders for pizzas, and held maintained and keep the kitchen and sub station stocked and organized.  There was minor janitorial work, dishes, floors, and taking out trash."
good,"Casey's needs to take care of the stores it has instead of opening new stores in other States. My experience is going on 7 years now, first as part time then went to full time to gain vacation time. The Pay grade was lousy but in a small town I feel they take advantage of there not being jobs available to us. I started out at below 9.00 and after 6 years only at 9.75. I love being a Cashier, love the Interaction with most all the Customers. They Know me and Respect me as I return that Respect. Learned their names , it's a fun place to work when everyone does their job. I hate entering my shift and find things in a complete mess. However I find that I do not have time to get to the rest rooms, empty trash, sweep parking curbs, stock cups/lids, check fountain pop, cooler is always needing stocked, spills happen, people need help pumping gas, it is a very busy place. So in order to get things done I end up doing things at the end of my shift, going over my scheduled time off. True if I have that 2nd Register person doing things as the day progresses it allows me to be more relaxed and focus on the gas pumps and my register. Our store is the only Gas station in town so we are extremely busy, open 24 hours. Bigger store, more to clean and take care of but our salary does not match the extra effort we put into the store. I am tired of never getting a scheduled break, I pretty much stand and work my whole shift. Working 8 Hr and sometime 9 Hr shifts with no scheduled break. Yet smokers can go out several times, many smoke breaks for them and it is allowed. I am a non smoker, devoted"
good,"I would usually work overnights after another employee was terminated. I became one of the main overnights so I worked alot, At night is was pretty easy going, do my chores and check out customers if they came in. Get things ready for when our manager would come in in the morning. "
good,"A typical day for me at work was going in at 4 pm and working until 11 pm.  I would have consistent contact with the customers, helping them find something, checking them out at the register, making their pizzas or their subs.  I also would do inventory for the grocery order.  I helped stock the cooler and other shelves.  "
good,a typical day at caseys began with opening the register greeting customers and organizing the merchandise. employees were nice and always had a smile on their face.
good,Can be a good atmosphere for college students and retired person with a chance to move up rapidly. Must be able to adjust to any situation.
good,"A typical day At work at Casey's General Store was very laid back. Since they were the only 24 hour store in the small of Milaca they had a very large amount of regular customers. My General Manager was a very serious man but he also had a great sense of humor that all the customers loved. He taught me a lot about how to connect with each customer but also take your job and your responsibilities very seriously. My co-workers varied from people around my age to people had been there for ten years plus. But all of my co-workers made my job very productive and most of them made it very enjoyable on a daily basis. The hardest part of that job for me, was learning all of the rules and laws when it came to sale of gas, tobacco, and lottery tickets. I learned just how many laws you have to be aware of so that your store or the company you are working for can run a successful legal work place."
good,"unusually long shifts, how to make pizza's and various other foods, count out change down to the exact penny, my co-workers were fun but not really looking for anything challenging"
good,Kept busy all shift. Customers as well as employees were fun to be around.
good,"We make food for the customers. I learned it doesn't matter how hard I try you can't please everyone. Management is tough, some days when your co-worker's don't do the job as told. Firing a co-worker for not doing the job. Going to work"
good,"Received orders for merchandise or services."
good,"stocking,preparing foods,good customer service.hardest part would be the rude customers an lack of communication"
good,"I worked at Caseys 2 different times. I really enjoyed the first time as the management was good. She cared about what others had to say and worked with us professionally. If there was a problem, she discussed it with us in private. There were two morning cashiers, myself and another gal. we had a great shift, we worked hard and efficient and always did our jobs, including jobs that were left by the night shift. The second time I worked for Caseys, I worked under another manager. She was fun, but not consistent with her rules. If there was a problem, you would hear about it thru the grapevine, instead of being addressed directly. Almost everyone had problems with this manager. We held meetings with the area supervisor, but when the manager and the area supervisor are friends outside of work, its really hard to have anyone reprimanded for any wrong doing."
good,Great Manager..Great Assistant Manager..good co-workers...nice customers
good,I loved working for Casey's but the system they had going just wasn't working and no one could work together due to the drama.
good,"In May I will have been there for three years. The job consists mainly of ringing customers and the everyday side work. What makes the job fun is in the town we live in, many are close friends, related or out right hate each other. So the best part is greeting every customer with a hello and smile. Often times customers will give us a hard time and tease. The atmosphere is very small town, good-natured harassment coupled with genuine sincerity.  The most difficult part would be: the company itself does not support their employees well. Pay-scale is low, advancement incentive is lacking, often employees are left alone for hours because store cannot afford payroll."
good,meeting new people everyday is exciting but its a low level job with hardly any room for advancement so the pay is minimal with no benefits.
good,They worked with me on scheduling and loved performing customer service
good,"Casey's General Store is a convenience store that belongs to a chain of Casey's through out Missouri and surrounding areas. Many Casey's serve pizza, subs, and handmade donuts. In a typical day employees were designated in different areas of the store whether it be kitchen or register. Employees trade shifts throughout the day and are assisted by management round the clock. I learned how to conduct managerial tasks, which I assisted in and maintained when upper management was not around. Also, I learned how to work every area in the store, work with customers, and build my customer service, sales, and management skills.  We had a team of employees that were successful and enthusiastic, and both management and employees worked as a great team. Employees are provided with  benefits, such as medical and dental insurance, 401k, sick leave and paid vacation.I advanced to Assistant Manager within four weeks and would not have considered leaving so soon, had it not been mandatory. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with management to provide a better environment for each employee and customer. There were no hard parts of my job. Some tasks were more difficult than others until the concept was grasped, but it was more challenging than hard, I would say."
good,I liked it there but you have to work a lot of weekends until 11 and i didn't like that so much
good,Good job and a honest days work.  Most of the workers are hard working individuals whom want to do a good job.  You will run into some who just want a paycheck and do the least amount of work they can.  Management in our store was not qualified to work in a supervisory position as they treated the workers poorly.  Many times I was told about or witnessed the manager belittle a worker or swear at them all of which is not appropriate behavior for the manager.  The hardest part of the job was a lack of organization and putting in to many hours trying to do a job for others who had not done their work or not showed up.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer service you are allowed to give to the general public.
good,"I would say Caseys is a good starting job, they pay alright and its a pretty easy going job. "
good,"a typical day at work, supervising 3-5 employees at once, and taking care of my customers.  Hardest part of the job, getting extra help to come in when needed"
good,"Work a 9 hour work day, some days on register and some days in kitchen, made pizzas, sandwiches and other food items for the warmer for customers, the hardest part of the job was keeping other employees from ""gossiping"" about other employees, i enjoyed working with the customers, i trained to be 2nd assistant manager, counted deposit, and took to bank,figured out all paper work from the day before and entered it into the computer and sent to corporate. "
good,Was given a great opportunity to advance and get my own store.  Too bad my supervisor was stealing money from the company!
good,I would run the cash register and lottery machines. I also cleaned and stocked the shelves. I learned how to manage my time well and how to work independently and solve problems quickly. I had co-workers but we didn't spend a lot of time working together. I was responsible for my shift and preparing for the next shift. My co-workers were not willing to do more than what was required of them. The hardest part of the job was running a shift by myself. The best part of the job was the customers and the flexibility in work hours and shifts.
good,The pay is terrible. Not much room for advancement. A starting out store manager makes about the same as an assistant. Everyone (team members and  managers) is replaceable. The customers  are wonderful and fill my heart with joy.
good,"At he time I was there it was great at the beginning, but started to slack off with the branch MGR."
good,"I liked the job at times but there was also hard times but no job is easy all the time "
good,"I learned very quickly to multitask on the job as well as how to be courteous to all customers.  Management was exceptional, but it was sometimes a little disconnected between higher positions.  The hardest part of the job for me was the fact that I rarely had time to spend with my family.  The most enjoyable part was being able to meet others and assist my community in a variety of different ways."
good,"I enjoy people,  I am a people person I wait on customer ring up their orders make sure the coffees and teas are full at all times stock what ever may be running low cups,napkins,etc. Trying to make all customers day better for them."
good,Most of my coworkers would be a reason to go to work. It almost doesn't seem like a job when working with them. Customers bring a wide spread on the views of the type of people dealt with day to day. Colorful and great group of people.
good,I have learned to work as a team but some days it can be frustrating and stressful. The weekends are usually pretty busy but it makes time go by quick. Can be fun to work for Casey's if you also have a fun team.
good,"Casey’s in Hampshire is a great store to work at, but half the employees that work there socialize more than they work which is why I don’t feel like I fit in. The work is nice and I have the motivation to work hard everyday. Also some of the employees don’t have the same energy as I do, So sometimes it could be frustrating."
good,"The job itself is pretty easy to get down and after a couple days of training you'll have it down. The only thing is sometimes you won't get proper training. I was never officially trained to close, I was just scheduled with a veteran worker who knew what to do. Also, in my personal experience, I feel as if I'm being unfairly scheduled. In the past month I've only worked two or three times and it was only because they called me in. I wasn't scheduled for at least 3 weeks."
good,The store is the a good place but also has its ups and down like every place of work and u work more than u get paid for and there is a lot of customer service requirements for this job and many more things!
good,it is a fast paced enviroment with some challenges but overall its a great place to work. my manager and i became close3 and she understood what i needed and i understood what she needed. the hardest part of the job was when we ran out of something that was popular with the customers
good,"I enjoyed the job, it was fast paced and hard at times but i was up for the challenge. Wasn't a bad job just bad management. Theybwould make a schedule and then change things without notifying you, then you would get in trouble for not showing up."
good,It was a paycheck. Working hours were low and it was a very stressful atmosphere. Fast pace day normally went by fast. Would go back but rather find other employment.
good,"Small store on the south side of a small town with approximately 10 employees, total. For the most part, we ran like a well oiled machine, between the three management positions, scheduling, payroll and overall  morale of the team were our top priorities. Our pizza kitchen had very few complaints and any that were brought to our attention were remedied as soon as possible. Overall, a very nice place to work."
good,"Was good liked the people relaxed third shift wasnt all bad, the pay was only ok the hours were ok i worked part time so couldnt give you an over all good experience"
good,management is rude and are not understanding ...they call u names and talk down to u. i was called stupid and asked if i could count even as a manager.
good,The store I work at has a family atmosphere. I started out as part time kitchen help in Feb 2016 and was store manager before my year mark. I honestly enjoy the atmosphere in this store
good,It was a fun experience sadly they have a problem with hiring bad management but if you can get a good manager then working their isn't to bad of a job
good,"In my town Casey’s is 1 of 3 gas stations but it was the most popular and thus the most visited. Week days were generally pretty dead with weekends being the busiest. It can get pretty boring when it’s slow but pretty stressful when it gets busy and a line starts to form. Management also sets tons of rules, some of which were kinda stupid and unnecessary. Coworkers there were the best part about the job hands down, a fun and diverse group of people, all of the best moments with that job involved the interactions with coworkers."
good,"There are many things to do to keep you working, and on your feet. It was a great place to be able to be apart of. Very productive and always improving and expanding opportunities."
good,"Working at Casey’s was a very good paying job with long hours. But the whole staff was women and it was a lot of drama I couldn’t have in my life. I had a good work experience at Casey’s and wouldn’t mind going back, to a different store that is. I didn’t have any issues only with how bad management was."
good,"most the employees are nice to work with but the managers are horrible "
good,"I do like my job at caseys. The job is relatively easy. The co-workers are very plesent and easy to get a long with. Also, like speaking with customers on a daily basis."
good,"The people I worked with were great. I just couldn’t get the hang of their time frames to get everything done. It just wasn’t for me, but it might work for someone else."
good,"I love my job and the people I work with. Unfortunately, I had some miscommunications and don't feel that I'm being treated fairly. It's a good work environment and I was lucky to work with amazing people."
good,"At Caseys if the manager likes you, you had the best schedule. how ever my schedule was all over the place in one week I would be scheduled a shift of days evening afternoon and over night. there was never time for my family"
good,I hardly made any money at all and people were in and out of the job often for various reasons. A big one being bad management and half baked training with high expectations. Not worth minimum wage.
good,"Lack of communication with employees "
good,I really loved this job but management was awful. She never helped and always messed up the truck order. Always late. Never orgnaized. She never gave time off.
good,"Corporate level knows what they want, but there is some major miscommunication by the time it gets to store level. Manager training could be a whole lot more comprehensive too."
good,This place has poor management I continue have to remind the manger to change my hours due to the fact I’m part time and they continue giving full time hours and scheduling is a nightmare due to the fact you have to check week to week
good,"The pay was good, my coworkers were okay. I would’ve worked there a lot longer if they had hired appropriate people to run the store instead of people who don’t know what they’re doing."
good,"Overall, it encouraged me to be a better employee from working at fast food. As I transitioned, I found myself a little more and I prove to impress the employees that I'm a fun, awkward person. Although there are many things that could be better, overall it's a decent place to spend your time making good money."
good,"I loved working with most of co-workers. Didn't appreciate the click mentality. Did not appreciate the willingness of some employees to verbally belittle others, just to make themselves look better. I quit when customer service was not based on customers, instead of corporate."
good,"A typical day at work was full of orders both called in and taken from the counter. Mostly pizza was made, though there was several Sandwiches made through the day. It was important to make sure the warmers were full of various foods, mostly but not limited to Pizza with various toppings. A typical day was guaranteed to be intense and constantly moving. on top of the aforementioned duties, pizza dough has to be made, and dishes needed to be done before you went home from your shift."
good,My manager was not very professional she called into work not than the employees but overall it's a good environment with mostly good people to work with.
good,"Boring and repetitive work with low pay. But the coworkers were nice and typically did their job, and there was one really good member of management who held us all together. Overnight shifts are pretty chill during the week except for weekends and All You Can Drink Thursdays."
good,"Worked anywhere from 20 to 45 hrs a wk being part time . They can't keep help the store I was at the corporate lady was a real piece of work. The people that do go up and beyond they careless about.  They give higher raises to the kids that literally sit and do nothing.  Its like a revolving door when it came to keeping people. I liked the fast pace always being busy .  I don't like being told that ""you're prob not even doing your job"" as i sit there elbow deep in dough.  No your right, I was doing someone elses job. That they refused to do caise of laziness.   They're so tight on employess that I more or less train yourself. You'll be put on 1st register alone after the 1st day of training.    The managers aren't trained in all things there's alot they don't know."
good,"Need new management, and need new trainning "
good,Fun and challenging place to work.  Do not get the tools to truly do your job well.  Expectations of work whatever hours needed because you are salary. Training & staffing expectations are not very good.
good,The place is ok to work at. Most of the employees are nice. It pays higher than most gas stations in the area. They are mostly flexible with someone's schedule.
good,"Typically, I make food or work as a cashier. For the most part, I'm a cashier who greets customers upon entry, rings up their purchases, and cares for the store's maintenance. I often do work such as making coffee, filling creamers, stocking items, and cleaning bathrooms. I do shift changes on the register as well. Personally, I find this stressful due to the fast-paced environment. The store is often funneled with friendly customers."
good,"I enjoyed working there, just didn't like not having set hours and I did not like that we did not start occurring PTO until we were there a whole year."
good,The manger would hire unfit people and would make the work place hard but I managed. Wasn’t a bad place to work just the manager and the people made it hard to enjoy.
good,It was a very friendly atmosphere.  The customers were generally friendly and patient. I would consider it to be a great place to work. You meet some really amazing people at a job like this.
good,"I liked working at casey's I never had any problems with coworkers or customers at the location i worked at. I was in charge of running the register, cleaning, monitoring the  pumps and closing the store"
good,I was a pizza maker and also made donuts and sometimes made subs. An did alot of cleaning and stocking alot food and alot drinks. An just made sure the store was clean for costumers.
good,"A typical night at work consisted of inventory and nightly cleaning of the entire store.  From the cash register, tea, coffee, and pop dispensers, to the bathrooms.  Taking out all of the trash and making sure to have a zero discrepancy with the cash drawer at the end of my shift."
good,Wasn’t terrible could be better but it also could be worse. It’s a gas station don’t have that high of expectations they’ll hire anybody and you’ll get stuck there
good,"Work each day was pretty expected and routine. However, communication with management was stressful and inconsistent leading to many misunderstandings."
good,I like working at Casey's especially the people I work with. Its fast paced and can be really busy at times. It seems like everyone gets a long. Casey's is basically a job until I can find a better job cuz I can't raise a family in a part time job
good,Caseys was a great place to work if you have a good manger. The last manger I had was self absorbed and dint care about his employees and only cared about his life. They are a great gas station if you have good people iur working for or working with
good,"Caseys started out as a very Family friendly store but lost there touch as bigger they got, they went and changed alot of things all at once which is fine if they train people better."
good,Casey’s was not a bad place to work if you like fast pace and always moving around. The employees are nice. The only thing I didn’t like was the manager but that’s just my opinion.
good,I worked at two Casey's locations. Both places had inconsistent and poor management. There seemed to be favoritism amongst co-workers. Pay does not compensate for the drama that occurs on a daily basis there.
good,"I personally feel that Casey's General Store would be a job for a student or someone looking to save money but not live off of, unless you had someone else helping support finances. I personally did not have a good experience working at Casey's."
good,Work hard and do your job and move up easy you get raises better at Casey's General Store I loved working with the people I was working with and I love making my customers happy
good,"Caseys is an decent place to work. You could possibly make a career out of it, if you wanted to ti. Pay is decent and the people are great. Management needs t be fixed a lot."
good,"A typical day depended on if I was cooking or cashier.  For cooking, I would start the ovens & doughnut fryer, start baking doughnuts and over food for breakfast & stir doughnuts & place in bowl to be fried.  Then I would make breakfast pizza, bake it & cut it for the warmer.  Then at around 10:30 am, I would start making lunch foods for the warmer.  For cashier, I would count the cash in the drawer and start ringing up sales for customers."
good,i would make pizzas every night and do other basic kitchen duties. I also worked up front running the cashier from time to time.  The kitchen also had responsibility of doing dishes and garbage also.
good,"Job overall was fun and easy to learn. Fast paced environment and steady flow of customers. There is always something to do or clean. One big downside is working with people who don't want to work and management that don't force them.  In the 4 years I was there, I rarely got positive feedback from management and raises/evaluations are based on whenever the manager gets around to it."
good,"Our community Casey's is a bit more relaxed compared to some others. Actually, as with any gas station convenience store, they all depend on who its run by.  I always had something to do and I looked forward to working with my coworkers in the kitchen. I learned how to do lottery and to cook in the kitchen."
good,"prepare and make donuts"
good,I liked the job itself but didn't experience enough to honestly review it because of prior family issues but I'd recommend his job as a good starter job
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that are never satisfied no matter what you do. But you're co-worker's will do what they can to help you out when you need it.
good,This I would have to say is one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. We were required to do minimal work consisting of stocking shelves and working the cash register. Our team was fun and it was a relaxed easy job that I would recommend to anyone home from college for the summer or something like that. Definitely not a long term job though.
good,"cook clean run register restock, the learning on the job of trying to balance a work load.  Are manage is very much about making a general statement instead of addressing the employees that are not following the guidelines or holding up their job shift duties.  the working environment in not relaxed for we are micro managed. The hardest part of the job in when we are understaffed.  the most enjoyable part is when I am schedule out front to meet and wait on the customers."
good,"Not many opportunities for growth and there’s pretty low pay. Job isn’t terrible though, can be enjoyable if you’re a people person. Busy days are nice. Scheduling needs work though you will be out 11PM sand back the next morning"
good,It's a part time job that is some what flexible to work around your schedule.  Sometimes you are required to work by yourself out front on busy nights which can be stressful at times
good,The job could have beeen alot better if felisha would have not been so dishonest with me at the blue springs north store. She has trust issues and would not drop certain things when I saw other managers doing exactly what I did and she never saying a word. Most of the time was a good job just got busy fri-sats and game night sundays.
good,"Caseys that are located in other areas can be different from slow to fast paced, from one supervisor and what they expect to what another expects, the environment of the customers in one area compared to another as well as the employees around you from ones that want to work to kids that dont. It really does depend on the location sometimes."
good,"It was a fun place to work, but just wasn't really the place for me. I like fast paced, and keeping busy. Straight cut rules, and opportunities to go further in my career"
good,This job has many components going itno it. it requires very good time management and quick paced learning. limited training. almost no help when need it.
good,"I liked working there but when I realize I was pregnant I couldn't lift the heavy crates in the back, they cut my hours to one day a week even though I was full time."
good,clean machines and oven throughout the week. cook pizza and sandwiches for customers and warmers. lot of work for one person as well as providing food up to standard when the lack happy and well trained works to keep with food up to date on the useable dates
good,Most days would be slow in the mornings by evenings it would get busy some customers would complain about food but it would be no managers to do give refunds or anything so they would get mad and complain about that and that would result in a write up .
good,"the work was easy enough to accomplish, but management fails to listen to worker problems. Management also fails to follow through on promises. Overall the rest of the staff was friendly and willing to help when needed."
good,It wasn't a bad job to have. 2-11 shift wasn't that great of a shift but I prefer mornings. Seeing regular customers was a benefit. Worst part of the job was no regular break times.
good,"From clock in to clock out, whether I worked an 8 hour shift or a 5 hour shift, the atmosphere amid the team members was of good morale. It encouraged great interactions with customers and better food sales. Productivity was also very high on the list."
good,"The average day of work consist of cleaning during downtime, and being ready during usual rush hours. While most employees are helpful and contribute to the workplace there are always a few who are not helpful in almost any way. At the store I worked at atleast the employees who were not helpful were given less strict guidelines than the ones who showed up on time and did the work required of them. Management picks favorites, and shows the employees they do not like no respect. Management only cares about if the employees do as they are told and do not care to listen to anything that they say."
good,Management didn't know what they was doing. It was only getting worse. People I worked with where nice. Didn't order enough supplies half the time . Managers had better then attitude.
good,"My experience was different from others. I was in the army, just got back from training. I had a few issues with scheduling which led to my departure from the company."
good,"Not great job security, but overall learned NCR  system, no place for advancement."
good,Same thing every single day. Routine is key. It's a Coustmer service job. Coustmer is always right. Pizza is good. Kitchen is always well kept. Managment is ok
good,"I really enjoyed my job with this company, and enjoyed the interaction with all customers that came in the store. I loved the duties that I had in the store, and loved the relation with my coworkers that I had. What I didn't like about this job was specifically the assistant managers attitude about her job/ her team, and the way that she handled things within the team's issues. I also covered all the call ins and missing days and that was not my duty."
good,"Casey's is big on customer service. That must be a requirement. Casey's isn't a bad place of employment, a lot of turn over for the most part. Very hard to advance."
good,Great store manager great coworkers its easy to work there not manyhours thou. It sucks trying to live off part time. I love the enviroment the people of district manager is a pain
good,Casey's are good for people looking for employment who need cash handling experience or do already have restaurant experience. Diverse work space for behind the scenes food making or customer service workers up front
good,"always clock in and relieve the person at the register. management isnt fair at all and unprofessional. Workinhg with everyone i did was fun, we were friends and always helped when needed. There wasnt really a hard part at this job."
good,No one was really friendly and got a creepy vibe. The manager there is old and seems to have a angry attitude all the time but on some days hes okay..
good,I liked going to work here but not as much as Sonic. The manager was rude to certain people and if your not on her good side nothing ever seems to be good enough. The crew members were amazing and so were customers
good,"I have made some wonderful friends working here. However, due to circumstances that I have no control of I have found it necessary to move on and return to an office environment."
good,I really like this job honestly. The only thing I think needs improved is the training for both support staff and management. There are to many discrepancies in policy and training in being told something should be done in 3 different ways. There is no consistency..
good,It's a very easy laid back place to work. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. We all worked together to keep the store running smoothly.
good,"Casey's General Store was a very friendly work environment, everyone was nice. A typical day insisted on cooking pizzas, taking orders, and cleaning up the kitchen. I learned how to make dough and work with others."
good,"great job but there was a lot of drama, I enjoyed going to work everyday. I learned what team work was really about. My typical day was going into work making sure my uniform was complete made sure I had my hair net and hat. Made sure everything was stocked for the night and made sure there was enough pizza dough made. I made sure there was fresh new warmer pizza slices in the warmer every hour."
good,I hated this job. I guess it wasn't really that bad for a first job but looking back on it I was miserable at that job. Terrible management all around
good,"Long Tiring, but the customers keep me going. I learned how to cook different foods. The management is not that good. Some of my co workers are nice. The job is fairly easy."
good,"stock in the fridge, and shelves, run the register, take out trash and do clean up. management was to invested in her friends, co-workers are ok, hardest part was pleasing the management, enjoyable part was that it was easy."
good,Work was fun depending on who you worked with. Working with the public is a challenge cause you get some really rude people and you have to remain calm.
good,"I enjoy working in the public atmosphere and meeting new people on a daily basis, making sure all the customers are satisfied when they leave the store."
good,I enjoyed the customers most of all.  When doing my job I always kept in mind that it was them that I was working for.  I knew that everything I made was a reflection on myself.
good,"A typical day would be to show up clock in and go to your area of work. You will be responsible for insuring customers are taken care of and are happy with the service. You will be responsible for maintaining a clean work area, store, and lot. The most enjoyable part of this job is your customers. The hardest part of the job is the pay is barely above minimum wage."
good,It's your typical job as a cashier. Interacting with customers.  The management there is great to work for and with. I enjoy all of my co workers it's a pleasant place to work. Everyone gets along and we have fun but it doesn't interfere with our job performance.
good,put in alot of long hours. It was  fast paced..not enough pay. for all the work that had to be done for the regular employees
good,"Working with the public has it's rewards, and it's drawl backs."
good,overnights are slow with not a lot of people coming in. you spend a lot of time cleaning shelves and stocking the cooler.
good,bank deposits waiting on the public great place to work . Fun environment to work in and great coworkers need a little bit more out of management though someone who gets running a store and not trying to make friends.
good,"when I first started I loved my job up until I went on maternity leave and when I returned we had a new manager who abused her authority towards a few employees including me. I always came in with a positive attitude because of customers I knew well, working a year there you know your customers and what they're there for. The area supervisor  told me I could come back but the manager for now says she has a full staff. The hardest part of my job was trying to get others to do what they were being paid to do and the most enjoyable part was seeing my regulars and meeting new people. my coworkers we all got along and they could tell you I am reliable and I do my job until its finished."
good,They were able to change my work schedule as needed.  I worked mostly from 3am to 2pm.  I opened the store at 5am.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.  I would have a certain set of people that I came to know and would make sure that their breakfast or certain coffee was made on time for them.  It was always a happy and busy place to be.  There was always something to do.
good,"The people you meet and see everyday is wonderful. Also, the co-workers that I work with on a daily basics are friendly and amusing to be around. Of course you have to be the type of person that is easy to get along with others easily. "
good,"I enjoy my days at work. Even though they seem to repeat day to day, the customers and satisfaction of my work keeps me going."
good,on a daily bases i usually just make pizzas and go to food for customers that either come in or call
good,I ran the cash register and stocked the cooler from 2-11 PM 4 days a week. I learned how to use a cash register. Management was good everyone was nice. The hardest part and easiest part of the job was standing in one spot hours at a time. It was boring/easy.
good,"good benefits but bad management. my managers did not communicate very well with the employees, and there were big issues with that. other then that i liked the work, was not hard and was pretty enjoyable."
good,I worked here so long ago that I dont remember a lot about it. My upper management team was helpful and reliable. 
good,Working at casey's for me could get vary stressful. The management was vary gossipy and did not always have the employees best interest. Over all casey's as a company shows good customer services values but lacks the respect for its employees.
good,"typical day at work, go to work, sart on my daily tasks and and do anything else hat had not been compleated on the previous shift."
good,I was An assistant manager I loved helping the customers no matter what the wanted.The management team was good I was treated good the only reason i left was to go to a higher paying job and unfortunately they laid us all off permently.
good,"This is pretty much an all around good ob, aside from the manager. She is the only problem i have, otherwise i enjoy working there, i enjoy the people, and it is a nice store."
good,"Casey's was a great place to work at when you first started. After getting setteled in things start going down hill. Co-workers get blamed for things that other employee's did. The manager doesn't order enough of the supplies needed to last the store until next truck day. The store manager may also wait until last minute to order, or make someone else do their job. One of the store managers is very rude and doesn't care if there are customers in the store or not."
good,"My day started out at 5:30 am. when I clocked in. My kitchen person would already be there, I would then proceed to set my safe, prepare my money bag for the day, count cigarettes and lottery tickets. Set up the registers, do bookkeeping, payroll, cigarette and lottery audit. By 6am my morning clerk clocked in and the store was open for business, The coolers were stocked by the next kitchen person who came in at 8:30am. Books were usually finished by 10am and then I was on the second register until 2pm when my shift normally ended. If I was lucky I was able to leave but not always."
good,7 am to 4 pm Monday thru Friday plus filling all uncovered shifts.
good,"Working at this job, and likewise at many others, they need very honest, loyal and dedicated workers. The kitchen work is fast pace, and the counter work requires you to be strict but also professional about the policy rules and state laws considering your selling tobacco products and alcohol. I absolutely loved this job and would recommend it to anyone jobless, seeking."
good,I felt Casey's expected too much out of one person.Got paid for a one person job doing a 2 person job. There were never enough employees working per shift to help with busy times. There should be at least 2 or 3 register at all times and 3-4 in kitchen (thats including delivery) at busy times. Instead they have 1 or (2 depends on the time of day) in kitchen and 1 up front register. Kitchen is also responsible for a 2nd register up front.
good,The managers were not that great. I felt I wasn't treated the way I should have been. They were not as helpful as they could have been for someone who has never worked before.
good,gives you a lot of hours and starts you on part time. people there are helpful and will train. Can work any time of day from open till close. never got full time but worked full time hours.
good,"While there was flexibility in the schedule and decent pay, there was obvious favoritism with certain employees. The manager was easy to talk to, but didn't really step in when problems arose. There was a serious ""we need to do this but when YOU have the time"" type of feel."
good,I just couldn't do the less hours . The overnight hours was not enough for the hours i was working if that make sense . My transportation was iffy at the time as well.  But im back and in better
good,Management works great with scheduling your hours and working around things. Doesn’t pay as much as competitors tho but it’s a good starting out of high school job or a part time summer job or a schooling needing money job.
good,this place was a good job when i first started then they switched managers and the place went down hill started losing more employees and food quality started going down hill
good,"I had previously worked for Casey's 5 years before this most recent stint, and nothing much had changed despite corporate's attempts. Specifically the rewards program, with which they let go of many employees over a misunderstanding they did not even explain. All in all I love working for Casey's, their message and values are similar to mine: being there for the customer."
good,I worked in the kitchen and every hour you have to replace everything in the warmer and by the time you finished you'd have to start over it felt like.  then the manager would always walk up and if you're working on the new batch and the other ones are expired she takes them all out before you can get anything done then customers don't have any food to grab.
good,"Employees were paid so low. I was there for 5 years and even as am assistant manager, never made it to even $12 an hour. I was overworked and very underappreciated. I loved my co-workers and the work itself though."
good,Casey's General Store was a terrific experience. The staff and people I work with on a daily basis are amazing. I would recommend Casey's for anyone who would like to grow as an employee.
good,The pay is not too great but its a good job if you are looking to get hours. There are three stores you can work in town with each of them having their own unique set of customers.
good,"I did not hate the job, but was not room for advancement. Management was was ok. Very small town very limited availability on schedule and pay"
good,In general Casey’s is a good company to work for. They however should have better check and balance for upper management  there is also a tendency of favoritism on a personal level   Managers need better training and people making policy should see 1st hand how it applies at. The store level
good,"This place is one of the busiest stores Casey's has, work is fast and furious at time. Management of time and people is a must to keep up with typical work day."
good,"Management was okay. Employees were okay."
good,it's all changing the manager don't want to help you they rather set in office and watch the tapes of you doing all the work and call someone from the kitchen to help because she's too busy setting doing nothing .P.S very poor manager for this busy company she's cut everyone's hours and she's taking them all for her self and if we go over what little time we have we all get wrote up I need a job to be happy with and stressed free. Casey use to be fun not no more.
good,At the time I was working there my manager was awesome she treated everybody Fair was willing to help anybody in their area making subs cashiering making pizzas best boss I ever had she no longer works there no benefits pay raise once every two or three years company does not stand behind you when something goes wrong
good,I have no comment at this current moment. I have been with the company again for 5 months currently. The staff that I work with are wonderful people and I get along with them very well.
good,I really enjoy working with people and you would get most of the same ones come in. Learning the lotty waz the hardest part for me. After a week i think i picked up on it. The manager was always there to help
good,"Casey’s isn’t exactly a job for everyone. I personally don’t like it, but it’s not what I want to be doing for the rest of my life either. Over all it’s not for me."
good,I worked here while attending college. It was fun with a flexible work schedule. My manager was nice and it paid decently for the job. I had fun working there.
good,It's a gas station job. Dont take in account families or what hours you can and can not work. But hey it's a job. There is something always better out there.
good,"It’s an alright job but stressful, pretty much when I worked there I was always there and I had people ask if I lived there, just everyone always called in. I think they need to give more raises and better benefits"
good,"The company is solid. It's long standing and you have job security if your a store employee or store management team member. However, the inconsistency of different areas, districts and regions is very upsetting. I feel Casey's gives district and regional mgrs to much power for variations on policy and how things are supposed to be done. You get used to one way then a shift in areas causes you to have to relearn a whole new way of doing things. This can be irritating. Also the company is very stingy on budgeting hours and expects store managers to work ludicrously yo fill in the blanks while simultaneously maintaining store appearance and customer satisfaction and ensure all office work is completed for pay that's laughable for the stress you endure. Raises are now laughable as well since the company is cutting costs everywhere. Managers dont feel trusted or valued."
good,I wouldve enjoyed working there more but some of the other employees were rude and complained if things werent exactly like they wanted. Putting the previous statement aside I loved my job there.
good,"I did not realize how much work a gas station cashier must do when working for a corporation. Never enough time on a shift to get everything done, but as long as you keep working what you don't get done is not held agents you."
good,"Casey’s was a great place to work at it was fun fulfilling and challenging at time but the previous gm always made it worth it, they have now got all new management even up above from ppl who work there and it’s been a good turn around from a customer point of view"
good,Okay job if they hired more employees. The daily tasks are easy to complete as long as every one does their part. Alot of day/night shift problems with who does and doesnt do certain tasks.
good,my typical day at work was counting my teal at beginning and if shift being customer friendly had regulars that would have short talk with us while they purchased their daily items ive learned alot about the store wanted to move up in positions but could not i was cross trained in the kitchen also the hardest part is when you have a customer yellng at you most enjoyable part my co workers and customers for the most part always got along joked laughed
good,"Staff Not very professional and scheduling was off all the time, the customer where great i enjoyed serving the public.Co worker was easy to get along with manager needs more training on how to supervise and learn time management."
good,I made sub deli pizzas and worked the register. I prep everything I make I also mad cookies and donuts. I mixed dough for pizzas. The people I worked with were not that nice.
good,"A typical day there starts at 2am for the food service specialist-donuts.  This can be difficult for some people to be there on time and be productive while they are there.  Throughout the shift, multiple types of people come through the store and most of them are a pleasant experience.  For me, the best part of my employment there is having the opportunity to build friendships and network with the regular customers.  I also get the opportunity to showcase my artistic abilities by decorating cookies."
good,I was a cashier at Casey's. I love meeting new people. A typical work day wold be helping customers. Making sure the store was clean. Very laid back job.
good,It's a decent place to work. Inhave been here for 5 years and will miss the company. I have made a decent amount of friends from the services that I have been doing these past 5 years.
good,"Not bad but not flexible with scheduling or work/home balance. Would be scheduled to work 10pm to 6 am Only to go home for a few hours and be back because I was scheduled for my next shift 2pm to 10pm the same day."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Caseys in Cassville mo I was the asst. manager and loved it but it got where I was on call 24/7 and never to go any where but loved the job and the people I worked with
good,"While working there you had to stay constantly busy.Even if no one was in the store. You have to clean the bathrooms, sweep and mop the whole store. You have to clean the whole parking lot and take out the garbages and change garbages, You have face product on the shelves, process shipment weekly and etc. While I was there, I got stuck doing most of it alone even though there were multiple people working."
good,The company is fast growing.  I'm constantly going to other stores to help open them. I'm often given the task to train new management.   The company is great to work for.  They have a lot of changes coming.
good,it was a quick pace some days was extremely fast and some day was extremely slow. but the people working with me are great people to work with. the pay was good.
good,I complete my job but not happy with my employers I am assistant doing managers job because she doesn't want to have employees getting paid more than I do
good,"If you have the right people working with you, then the place is great to work at, but as the ""kitchen manager"" not having the backing of upper management to hire/fire to make the right team, it's stressful, and as the ""KM"" you are always on call to fill in for the team members that do not feel like being part of the team. If you do get hurt on the job, make sure you are taken care of through workers' comp, and remember that your case worker is not your friend, they are looking out for the best way to save the company money...aka: get a lawyer."
good,"If you quite or get fired and wait a year then try to go back, it's hard to get back in the company. I moved up in the company fast but when I got where I wanted to be. I was expect to do more then I was ok with doing. I was not thanked for all the work I was doing."
good,Not a good place to work unless you want to get yelled at every five minutes for legit doing what your suppose to be doing. They basically want you their to clean and the customers can basically deal.
good,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with and understanding frustrated customers, however the assistant managers were very good at teaching us how to maintain a professional exterior while helping resolve the problem(s) the customer was having."
good,"A normal day consists of cleaning and taking care of customers. I learned how to better deal with customers as a whole. The immediate management was very helpful, but the district manager didn't seem to do very much. Hardest part was definitely taking things off the truck, and especially when we would have to wait months to get something we ordered due to all the distribution centers not being in the area. I found my co-workers to the the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Working there was a good step up and helped me get a car after some saving and has good hours with chance of over time if you want it. I reccomend it to people looking for a good easy job.
good,"I like working there at caseys but there is some difficult times where i do not like to work there. i love my customers but the job it’s self is a great job, but some of my managment isn’t the best same with the coworkers."
good,Typical day at work I pick up coffee get to work get everything ready for the day the kids start to come in then we eat breakfast then do some lesson plans then play out side have lunch then we go take a nap.
good,I found it difficult to ask for time off where I was at. I enjoyed meeting new people as they came into the store. Casey’s was a nice start to experience working during high school. I did not have the opportunity to work all the hours I was scheduled since I was only a kitchen helper.
good,"Fast paced environment, employees have to adapt for following policies and procedures.  Hardest part of the job is to find employees that want to work."
good,"Don't plan on a career with Casey's unless you work directly for the corporate office, drive a truck for the company or are a skilled trades/maintenance or IT tech. worker. This is a best a low-paid position with decent coworkers. At worst it's an understaffed, busy, gas station position with no perks except free coffee."
good,Working at Casey’s was okay. I was constantly working because we couldn’t keep people employed because of management treating employees poorly. Wasn’t terrible to work there.
good,"Easygoing "
good,It was a good place to work. I worked there for 23 years till they let me go. I had a 401K and insurance. They always say that family comes first but that is not true. You get sick or hurt and they are ready to get rid of you
good,Very good job keep me busy boss great fellow employees great we all worked good with cash handleing and light food prep we all worked together as a team and became great friends
good,Caseys general was an okay place to work. I personally would not go back. You don't get enough hours for the little pay you recieve. Definitely wouldn't be able to provide for your family.
good,Casey’s is a well known store. Paris South Main stays very busy during factory hours. Faced pace cleaned environment. Good job to give experience in many different places
good,"Just a little illegal in their expectations as an employee. The way they expect you to fight gas run aways is writing down license plates. This includes in the middle of rush when all pumps are full and people inside expect you to pay attention to them and not stare out the window."
good,"I absolutely LOVED my customers but when you have a manager that is poor and starts things about employees then tells your personal information to customers it's hard to swallow. "
good,It was a fun place to work. Just didn't work well with a new and unexpected schedule that came up. I wish I could of continued working there. The job was very easy.
good,Company is good to work for.. Stores have their own way of doing certain things. Wages are a little low for management considering all that they have to deal with.
good,"friendly staff and management good to start out with depending on location stores usually look pretty neat. some discounts. good donuts, breadsticks and pizza"
good,I was cleaning all the time. And was made to do more work than I was paid to do. I enjoyed working with everyone as long as they weren’t telling me how to do my job. I did my job well. I liked being outside
good,In my opinion Casey's General store would be a great place to work. with my experiences that I had their it was not a great place to work for me that was based on poor management skills in that location but other Casey's General stores that I have been in thrive with encouraging environments.
good,At Csey's I worked as a pizza maker. I took orders for pizza and fulfilled them. Sometimes i had to deal with customers directly. I always knew my schedule plenty of time in advance
good,I feel that job was good for someone who handles stress and high pacing well. But it wasn't really for me and I had to move. Some of the management was terrible and didn't help the workers much.
good,Caseys has a lot of room to move up in the company.  Casey's has decent benefits. The hours aren't bad. I enjoy how fast paced the job is. I really enjoy my staff.
good,"everything depends on your team. at a previous store is loved it. Most worked together as a team and just wanted to make the customers happy and do their job. "
good,everything was fine until the new manager came in. I really liked working there and everyone got along. They were not fair and treated everyone poorly.
good,The staffing is sometimes short which makes the job a little stressful but over all very friendly place to work. Depending on the location it may be busier than others.
good,It is a ok place to work if it is your first job.. people are good and you are never bored and it is never slow and it's fun and happy on holiday's and birthday's
good,I was a cashier and I worked in the kitchen and made food mainly pizzas. I stocked shelves and stocked the freezers. I did the cleaning. Its not a bad place to work.
good,"Management was pretty good, taught all different types of skills through my work experience there, all of my coworkers were very fun and sociable people."
good,"With the right people training you,  It will be a breeze learning everything.  "
good,"I think this would have been a good company to work for but I had a bad experience. I didn't like my manager and I didn't approve of many ways the store was ran. Other than that, I do believe had there been someone different in place, it would have been fine and I would have enjoyed my experience there very much"
good,It’s a lot of responsibility and a lot to do it’s a very high paced environment and have to be able to multi task and be fast at your work also be able to control your anger and resolve situations properly
good,The store was ok but the Store managers are terrible and never really cared about anything but getting in and getting out. you had to always try to figure things out on your own with no help from your superior they were too good to answer the phone.
good,It was not a bad place to work. But for me it just was not a place suited for me. I have nothing left to say about it other then that. The fellow emplyees were good people.
good,"Working in the kitchen at Casey's definitely had its ups and downs. Although, I did enjoy it most of the time. You had your prep work and then you had the warmers to take care of, on top of getting orders. It wasn't always bad. When you had coworkers that would help with the prep work. It just made your work day easier"
good,"Flexible enough with hours if you give manager a notice, starting pay was $10, I worked their for 3 years and only had a $0.20 raise though. Able to work more hours if you are willing to be trained in kitchen and cashier."
good,Lots of favoritism. People get away with  things without being responsible. Of course that affects everyone else. Making the same problems over and over and management doesnt fix them. People come in and go home whenever they want. People call off all the time. Nothing ever done about it. If you suck up to boss you get better hrs or pick your own hrs. People constantly talk about each other behind there back. Everybody always thinks there doing more than everybody else. Moral is bad.
good,the head manager was unfit to manage and lost a lot of employees due to negligence or just lack of caring. if not for that I'd probably still work there.
good,"Really liked my job, but I feel that the new management was a little overwhelmed. Some employees were not properly trained."
good,Working at Casey’s was a new experience for me. It helped me with my social and people skills. I met some friendly customers and it was probably always the highlight of my day. My coworkers were professional and cool people.
good,"When I was hired on I told them I preferred to only work the convenience part of the store, not the kitchen. The manager said that was fine and everything started out great. I later on told her I would learn the kitchen just in case someone had called off. After I learned the tasks of the kitchen, she had told me that the only shifts she had for me were kitchen. I was not happy about this due to being mislead. Also there were personal reasons why I ended up quitting and needed to relocate."
good,"Good job for an entry level job, hard work, odd hours at times.  Can be very busy.  Always something to do when the store is slow, so never gets boring."
good,It was okay sometimes the work would get too hectic and crazy and then everybody would get in a bad mood and not want to do anything which sucked on busy weekend nights when people didn't care.
good,This is a quick pace job. You need to be able to multi task. You need to have a food certification to be able to work with food. If working with food no jewelry invisible piercings.
good,"Quick pace, especially if orders come rushing. Hardest part is keeping up with rushes and if have heavy clean up after word. Learned how to deal with unhappy customers."
good,Easy going job. Learned thr job in two days. Got along with coworkers. Has a hometown feel. Time flys when your there and you meet a lot of different people.
good,Working with certain employees and customers made it a good work environment. Management was a mess and filled with drama. I loved the customers and the friendships that I made there.
good,The work environment depends on what location your at. The location in van meter was terrible. The manager didn't know what she was doing and people were lazy. The one in Waukee was ok
good,"Casey’s is a good place to work if you a team member. If you are a manager, they expect to much from you and only give salary. As a manager you have your mandatory shift, however if someone calls in on the next shif and can’t find someone to cover that shif the manager had to. Even if the manager had to work open to close all week they still got paid the same with no overtime, and they still had to be there the next day for the mandatory shift. If there was no assistant manager then the manager had to work 7 days a wto make sure the daily book work was completed. As well answer the phone call that was at anytime of day, even while on vacation"
good,Loved the work but the management was unorganized. Felt tense and never in order. Loved the fast paced feel but the store lacked control.  Would recommend work to first time job hunters.
good,"Dedicated Crew Member proudly delivering exceptional cleaning, waxing and sanitizing capabilities to customers. Focused, personable and educated on environmentally friendly cleaning products. Seeking new role as part of professional cleaning crew."
good,it wasn't the best job my shifts were always broke up into two shifts one in the late morning till early after noon then one from the late afternoon till night. the manager was never there when he should have been. we never got our breaks when we were supposed to the manager was way to competitive and favored people they over hired people and you were lucky to get 20 hours a week. over all it just was not a good place to work.
good,I love to serve people and I got to know a lot of customers I would enjoy cooking and baking I worked very hard and respectful I enjoyed working with people
good,"had a good time working there,  a typical day at work would be having friendly customers coming in and chatting with me and helping elderly people fill their gas tanks, the management was decent and the hardest part of the job was unloading the truck."
good,I enjoyed my job very much however I didn't make enough money I loved my co workers and my manager  I would of loved to continue to work there but money was not enough to get by
good,You would count your drawer before each shift. Then make sure coffee is made and everything is stocked. Check customers out as they come and go. Watch gas pumps while people are getting gas. Management was good. There was one manager that did not do much. Hardest part was keeping track of people at the pumps and making sure they don't drive off. The most enjoyable was talking with customers because you get regulars.
good,Good place for a student to work. Hours can be tough. There is room to be cross-trained. Advancement is tough. Typical day is pretty fast past paced. Benefits are decent.
good,"Making donuts when coming in during the morning, making pizzas. Wait on customers throughout the day. Making coffee."
good,"For a gas station, it wasn't a horrible job. I was trained in both the kitchen and on the register, so that helped break up what would have been a very boring work week. Coworkers tended to be lazy and corporate forced a wonderful manager out instead of letting her hire proper help."
good,The lack of management. It’s not run very well the manager get walked on by everyone else and he allows it to happen Which is very wrong and it needs to change.
good,This was a great place to work i learned all the job titles even making pizza and the customer were alot of fun  great people to work around i made alot off new friends.
good,"Not bad, not great. Management was lacking to say the least. Minimum qualifications required to work there. Decent pay and hours for working at a gas station."
good,Good company but managers end up working a lot of hours each week. Always have hours available for people to pick up. Friendly environment to work in.
good,I traveled from store to store every day for Kabredlo's. I ran five stores for them until they sold the company.  Casey brought them out. I ran eight stores on a regular basis unless another supervisor went on vacation.
good,the company is good to work for for a first time starter job but not long term they could have longer hours better pay and they could be better at working togather and have a better schedule to work
good,It's a ok place I wanted to work days they put me on overnights it's a nice place to work just wish it would have a better hours or at least 3 people on niggts
good,"In my opinion, working at Casey's can be enjoyable but at the same time very stressful.  The scheduling is always inconsistent and the stores are poorly managed.  The kind customers that come in daily offset the stress and make it more enjoyable."
good,it was fun working for caseys but i didnt like that when i was on call and they need something from another store i had to go get it the customers were regular so it was nice seeing the same people every day
good,"Its a gas station you are either a cook, driver, or cashier. How good of a manager you have will make or break your experience when working at Casey's."
good,"It's ok. They pay you for work, nothing more nothing less. If you get the right manager it's super pleasant to go to work and you meat some interesting people"
good,"Great co-workers who are supportive.  Management does not provide much feedback, but I worked part-time at night."
good,After clocking in you have to make sure there is enough dough in the walk in cooler to get you through your shift and if not you have to make some. At all times we have to make sure the warmer and sub cooler is stocked.
good,"This job was flexible with hours which was nice.  Not a lot of room for overtime, advancement into management or pay raises.  Not enough income offered for cost of living."
good,As a first job or a part time position isn't a bad place to work.  Someone looking for full time as a means of living may struggle.  Depends on co workers and management.
good,I worked with some very rude employees but i also liked the management in the back. The company is a great company to work for they listen to their empoyees very well and are always willing to change the outcome of things
good,"Fast-paced work environment the management is inconsistent when it comes to the company rules and regulations. They expect a lot from the staff, but are usually unwilling to help with the tasks they ask them to do."
good,I enjoyed meeting new people and seeing my regulars. it was like a small community. The job could be frustrating at times but you knew with great coworkers it was going to be okay.
good,If your looking just for anything. Work here. Good starting pay for high school aged kids. Never full time hours as they keep cutting them. Be prepared to stand on your feet your whole shift with 1- 15 minute break. If for some reason you work more than your scheduled shift you are required to take a 30 minute lunch unpaid of course.
good,good place to start off a career in this type of field. they have decent hours to give and some good benefits. i would recommend it as a starting point for young workers.
good,"When you get hired on at Casey's, they say its a part time job, but then you are scheduled to work 2 pm to 11 pm 3 days a week. Standing on your feet the entire time. There is no break room. If you take a break, there are some milk crates on the side of the building that you are not supposed to sit on. Casey's throws away so much food its criminal. They still make their employees pay for food even though they are going to throw it away. The security cameras are faced towards the employees instead of the customers that are shoplifting. Casey's doesn't trust its own employees"
good,Good place to work. Liked the employees. Management just is not responsible enough to run the place. Best Casey's in town because of the people who work there. New management is helping and making it better though. Higher ups are kind of a joke. Everyone in the store makes the most of it though.
good,it was a good job if you were into working as a cashier and nothing else im sure the was room for promotion but i didnt stick around long enough to find out
good,The work environment was not a positive place to be. The coworkers I worked with were miserable and not team players. My manager on the other hand was a great manager.
good,I will never work there again cause when you get sick and have to be at home and than have to have surgery on your hand and when you come back to work with doctors orders on what you can and can't do and so your manager let's you go.. that's not fair by no means...
good,The hardest part of this  job is balancing corporate wants with actual field maintenance. Must be highly self motivated to keep up with daily service calls.
good,"had great coworker and managers. some policies and rules I didnt agree with the gas pumps rules. no prepay and if you have a driveoff, your responsible"
good,It was busy during the summer and dead during the winter. A lot of stuff to do and usually able to stay busy. I learned how to deal with angry customers in different situations. It was a good place with a helpful atmosphere.
good,I didnt really want to work as a cook at this place but it was the only thing they had open. I would have preferred to be a cashier. Also the first go around the pay was not that good either especially being the only one working with bills to pay and you are trying to juggle everything.
good,The Casey's that I worked in was in a very small town where everyone knows everyone's business or at least thinks they do. So instead of it being about the business it was mostly about drama.
good,"Some stores are different then others. The better your management team is then the better the store will operate. Can be a great experience, and a fun place to work."
good,Overall it was a good place to work if you like making pizza and getting paid minimum wage. It’s just a typical pizza place I don’t know what else to say
good,"Balance the books for the day before, check the schedule for the day to make sure that everything was covered, check in any vendors for the day and stock selves"
good,"Enjoyed my Co workers,  didn't enjoy the high school drama that went on,  everyone causing problems for others,  trying to get others fired just because they don't get along with others."
good,"If you really need somewhere to work. It is a good place to start. They pay nicely and if you are a cashier, be ready to work 10 hours shifts because that is what you will work if you want days"
good,"I really enjoyed everyone I worked with and my management staff. It was a relaxed environment. I would recommend working at this store, they are flexible with your schedule"
good,"can not make a living off of their pay.  insurance is expensive,  cant get any overtime, had to find your own replacement if you couldn't work.  Not a very family oriented company"
good,This was the first job I had at of high school. It was mostly flexible when asking for different days to work. The people that work above you are great.
good,"Very recommend for an experienced cashier and has a history of customer service. Fast paced most of the time, can be stressful at first, but as long as you know what you're doing you can manage it."
good,the employees need better one on one training and the company needs to respect that.  the company also needs to follow up better with employees that do not follow the rules on a daily basis.
good,Good place to wok if you like talking to the public on a daily basis. Pay is not very good though. Not the kind of job that you would want to make into a career.
good,"Over all it was a good place to work.  They are picky about their pizza making, but they are the best by far around here.  The subs are not bad either."
good,I was a cashier at Casey’s until I was offered a different job. I liked my job as a cashier until I was told that cashiers have to be cooks on some days. I had to learn the kitchen amd how to make everything which was stressful. I was stuck in the kitchen when I wanted to be interacting with people because I was great people-skills.
good,This was actually one of my favorite jobs. I enjoyed the customers and the other employees. It took me awhile to get used to the fast pace work but I finally caught on.
good,"My managers liked to assign excessive tasks, text employees nasty reviews, and generally badmouth employees with other employees. I enjoyed my job when managers were polite."
good,I like my job there but at the time I was going to school and currently working there now and my hours are all over the place and never have a set schedule. I could work a 2-10 and have to come in at 4:45 in the morning.
good,I loved working here because you get to make pizzas and sandwhichs and I love to cook. If a person really wants a job that they make food this is the one to have because its not super fast paced but its enough to keep you busy through the day.
good,had a drunk manager who let a drunk addict in the kitchen and did nothing about it.  She would come in drunk and not supervise well.  She didnt hire who was needed either.
good,I absolutely loved working there. I did food prep. Cooked pizza and sub sandwich’s. Cleaned the kitchen and much much more. Couldn’t have asked for a better working environment.
good,"I left after a couple months. I was placed with another worker that was barely more experienced than me. This led to many complications on the job, this stress led me to quit."
good,"You have interact with others, know how to work a till, dealing with money. There is also a lot of counting. You do have to keep the place clean and tidy"
good,I enjoyed working at caseys it was fast paced and was able to work on my own I caught on quickly and was opening on my own within a day or 2 or starting.
good,The store manger at the time was a great person to work for she cared about her employees and also her customers as well the staff was great to work with
good,For what I can remember it was a good first job. Pretty relaxed until it gets busy. It was a pretty good job environment and a place to gain some experience working.
good,They need to get their Management under control. Learn how to interact with their employees in a positive way. Find employees that can actually do the manual work required.
good,"Working environment was ok. Had enough hours, customers were great. Learned how to work register, Hardest part of job is working all different hours, Opened store and closed store"
good,"Standard day in the life of a clerk. Help customers, stock shelves and cooler, make coffee, and clean. Every so often help make food in the kitchen. And clean."
good,Fast paced job. Always a changing environment. Good management team. Pay could be better but still not a hard job so pay is acceptable. Full time is hard to come by here.
good,got to meet new people. got to learn more things about customer service. depending on the day would depend on what the work load would be like. management was good for the most part.
good,"Must be able to learn quickly and be on your feet all day. Sometimes there is no chance for breaks, Also management is not all that great or helpful. Customer service isn't all that friendly."
good,the caseys in cerro godo is in an excellent location. they are located right across the street from the high school. Friday football and Saturday night races made caseys the spot to go. the store was super busy on those nights.
good,"Management is good to work with , they understand family, they will work with you if needed, Making pizzas and donuts is a blast, stocking cooler non son fun."
good,Casey's is a stressful place to work. Upper management not very helpful even tho they say they will help you. I enjoyed my position at Casey's. No day was the same which made it interesting.  Getting good help was extremely difficult. Staff gets overworked and cranky.
good,"You can get plenty of hours. Great to place to work as long as everyone works as a team and not against each other. I enjoyed working at Casey's. "
good,People who you work with can be fun. Its decent pace. Some of the rules I don't agree with but there's always a few a each job you want to twist. Managers play a huge part in how a person will work.
good,"The corporation has no concern about employees, allowing unproductive turnover.  The structure does not allow for reward of high function.  You're never more then ""just"" unless your friends with higher levels.  A lead can totally screw up, and break something causing customer damage, like getting stalled in the tunnel with a scratch from defective equipment or debris."
good,"I loved the people I worked with and most of the customers, it was stressful times but I pushed through it knowing there was better days ahead of me. I've never been one to work with food besides cooking at home but it was a good experience and I learned some handy tricks for while in the kitchen."
good,"flexible work experience, no problem working around your schedule and plenty of opportunities to advance in a positive work environment. it is a good starter job"
good,"Customer service. Cashiering. Store cleanliness. Sometimes you work in the kitchen making pizzas and sandwiches. Stocking, keeping fresh coffee and tea made."
good,working at casey's was great. My co-worker were like my family they helped you out when you needed it as long as you did the same. the hardest part of working here was trying to remember everything.
good,"This would be a great job for a community college student or an older person looking for something to do."
good,"A typical day of work was comprised of only a few basic characteristics as the requirements and events of each day varied quite a bit. In general i was, when in the kitchen responsible for cooking hourly food and providing made to order food as well. We primarily made pizza and sub sandwiches. Whilst at the counter my duties would include aiding and ringing up customers, facing shelving, stocking tobacco products, cleaning the store and replacing coffee. As my time at Casey's was fairly equally split between cooking and cashiering, it gave me ample opportunity to learn a variety of skills such as: operation of the dough mixer and other specialized machines, organization of multiple orders, solving of customer concerns with respect to timeliness and company guidelines, as well as watching for potential security risks. The management at Casey's was i think misrepresented during my tenure, as while i was working there we went through 3 or 4 different store managers, lost two assistant managers, and for a period of time went without a store manager entirely. As a result, we workers saw a number of different approaches to management at the store, none of which where exhibited for very long. The culture of the place was what i would say i enjoyed the most. While the job could be strenuous, fast paced, and taxing, it could also be fulfilling, decently paced, and interesting. Most of all, i enjoyed the friendly atmosphere that was shared between us employees and many of our regular customers. As far as what was most difficult with the job, i would have to say that there was variability"
good,Fun to work seeing all kind of people. Was not fun was I wasn't allowed to go to the restroom with out someone coming in. I had to ask an employee to watch my register
good,"casey general store was my first real job in life, and that's exactly what it means...... it should be a job you have early on in life, definitely not a career."
good,"Overall, Casey's was a fairly pleasant place to be employed. The regulars were friendly and all of the fellow cashiers and kitchen workers were wonderful to work with. Management could use some re-schooling in manners and customer satisfaction but it doesn't entirely eclipse the otherwise relaxed and easy environment."
good,"Very fast paced environment, A typical work day was counting the safe money, balancing paperwork, deposits. How to talk to upset customers and how to get employees to make better choices at work is what I learned. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers"
good,"All of the Caseys stores are nice to work at and depending on which location, they have plenty to do and positions to work at. My experience there was calm."
good,Stressful.  Very difficult to get promotion.  I was there everyday. On-time everyday.  Even covered shifts.  And someone else with half the credibility got promoted.
good,"Would recommend, however it was just not the Job for me, good staff, good manager, but the company itself has problems once you get into higher management."
good,I enjoyed working there. The people made it fun and enjoyable. Learned about how everyone has their own way of doing things. It takes all kinds of people to make a business work. Sometimes it was difficult to keep up on the busy moments of the day.
good,"I liked working here , but the management was poor . Great hours , decent pay . Walking distance from bus route . The workers are nice as well........."
good,"The job was ok, the manager at that time didn't know much about the job, and was not available a lot.  A good job though for someone not needing to support a family."
good,"You have to keep the shelves stocked like any other conventient store. This one has a kitchen though, that I also worked in and prepared various types of food ranging from pizza to different types of chicken and also some dessert foods. I liked working for this company and seeing the 'regulars'."
good,Cashier included cleaning and running the register and counting bakery items. I learned that it was nice to work there aside from hardly ever getting breaks. Hard on the feet and awful scheduling they never had it done on time. I enjoyed the 50% discount on their food. Careful upper management is strict I was fired for sitting on the counter after working 6 hours with no break.
good,"Good work."
good,Busy most of the time . It was a nice place to work for . wish that i could of found something that was close to my house' I enjoyed working for this company. I would work for them again.
good,Great job for a second job or for a single individual. Decent benefits and pay. I recommend this job to anyone looking to make a little extra money. I had a great experience.
good,Casey's is a good place to work Casey's give you excellent training for your job. They are flexible in your scheduling. They treat you with respect and dignity
good,The store manager at Store#1896 is an awful manager..She was Scheduling me 6 days a week for 2 Months in a row..Don't ask for less days cause the next schedule turned out being 7 days..She doesn't let you use your vacation days when needed
good,great people friendly enviroment positive workplace helpful co workers get to know customer on a daily basis .its like a having a whole second family at work
good,Casey's is fun to work at if you have the right people. It can be boring and slow at times. It is just a job I worked at to pay the bills while I went to school.
good,"Typical day is long, interacting with customers that are jerks. Coworkers can be fun and you can have a lot of laughs on a slow day, but busy days will make you want to quit."
good,the pople were very nice and easy to work with and very friendly the hours were nice and flxiable the boss were very understanding when asking for time off
good,They care for their employees. They try to work with your personal schedule best they can. They try to look at the best fit for manager positions and they give you pointers to help you get that positions next time around
good,the work place is friendly and works very well with its employees. It was easy to get the hours needed and stay employed. The general manager made the job enjoyable and some where everyone wants to go.
good,"Casey's General Store is a fun place to work with good advancement opportunities for the right people with long term careers in mind.  This is ideal for college age people who like to work weekends and evenings. The work schedule is pretty good, with rotating weekends and plenty of work flexibility. The benefits are good also.  Casey's has a strict policy code that leave little room for errors, which I think could be improved upon. Other than that it is an enjoyable place to work."
good,"Learned to make Great Pizza's. Cross trained to assist other store employee's. Stock kitchen, keep work environment clean.  Answer phones and take orders."
good,"It's a great place to work, the company is not a bad place the workers is pretty OK as well. I was content with my responsibilities I was given while I was there."
good,Typical convenience store setting with food service area offered. Management was decent to work for and work was easy enough to do for the most part. Small town area and attitude.
good,Started off a wonderful place to work then after a certain amount of time there they don't care for their employees the way they should. They are known to promise you management spots then back out of it after you move.
good,I love my job and my co workers but this store needs improvement. We are definitely over worked and there is favoritism. I wish I could change quite a few things
good,Had alot of fun and in small home town community. Fast paced and upbeat employees. Learn to communicate with others and learn good skills retail skills.
good,Worked all different shifts.  Learned how to work in their kitchen. Hardest part was the different shifts and the most enjoyable was the management and other employees
good,Casey's is a wonderful job to have. The benefits help out tremendously in our own family. Having the same customers everyday gives you hope to see the kid ain't scared.
good,Working at Casey's is great for a first job. There are no real breaks or lunch breaks. Difficult to get full time. Customers are great to interact with.
good,Fun working place. Nice customers. Acceptable work hours. Fun working with the employees. Clean and smooth atmosphere. Nice looking uniform provided.!
good,"I would count the safe before and after each shift. I would work on the cash register, maintain the cleanliness of the store, Made sure there was always fresh coffee for the customers."
good,Casey gas station was a good job. i learned alot more skills and most of all costumer service. maintaining enough product and satisfying the costumers .
good,"It was a pleasant place to work, I liked my employees.  Most people were respectful of each other, though there was some cattiness that occurred. I loved the responsibility and the job tasks."
good,"Customer service is key when it comes to this job. a friendly and helpful face is nice to have, you will also always be on your feet most of the time."
good,Decent place to work. Co workers are willing to help you out. On feet a lot but it there are several different tasks. Have repeat customers so it's nice getting to know them. Know what they want when walk in the door which makes them feel appreciated
good,Doing the requirements for the job and also having good co workers to want to enjoy there job rather than blow steam about it.
good,"Great pizza!  Created a great relationship with the customer and learned a lot about customer service.  Also, had fun in the process."
good,It was a nice place to work I worked in the kitchen and then moved up to cashier. I worked in both spots before moving to assistant manager. As assistant manager  I helped with unloading the truck and with the sales coming in to put their products in the store.
good,It can be a fun workplace if you work the night shift. Butt everyday your hours are completely different from week to week some days you may be working 12-hour shifts other days 3 hour shift. You may have 4 days off one week and one day off the next week. There's No consistency causing big problems if you are very family-oriented as I am.
good,What to say about Casey's. I have worked for the company for a non consecutive 10 years and only made it to kitchen manager at 9.50 a hour well it's not bad for a gas station.
good,"Stayed busy, always had customers, loved seeing different people really enjoyed my store manger and 1st assistant manger. They are amazing people.. very clean store one of the cleanest in this town"
good,I enjoyed working with the public and the fast paced environment. The management was terrible and that made the employees dislike being there.
good,A decent company to work for. However when a family matter came up none of the other employees or managers where available to help when needed. And when i put my 2 weeks in they just fired me and will not hire me back.
good,"Although most of the time I enjoyed my employment there, I found that they were to corporate.  General corporate guidelines are important but each store and community are different and I feel flexibility is important"
good,Place is fun to work. You meet a lot of new people and helps your interactive skills. Not many ways to advance unless your working at the warehouse.
good,"Caseys was an enjoyable place to work. I loved the regular customer as well as the new. Very welcoming place. The store is always clean, well stocked."
good,"The people were extremely fun to work with and extremely helpful. The only problem that I had with this employer was their lack of communication and inability to follow through with commitments made at time of accepting the position. Often times I felt like I was lost in a sea of confusion because I was thrust into situations without adequate instructions. However, the fact that there were other employees there that were eager to help made it feel less overwhelming."
good,It was always very hard working at Casey's. Sometimes it would be very slow paced while other times you had to call in more help. Nobody seemed to want to work.
good,At Casey's you must be very good at watching the gas pumps and be able to do all of your side work at the same time. It was difficult at first but you soon get the hang of it and it gets easier over time.
good,"This was a good night job to help with expenses. the pace could get stressful depending on how many pizza orders you had, sometimes hard to get all your required work done."
good,They could have been a little more relaxed and understanding. Some of the corporate rules and regulations I didn't think was fair. Some management needed to be adjusted.
good,I loved the environment here. The workers/customers/employers were enjoyable. The worker's compensation plan could be better.
good,"Working for Caseys taught me a lot of skills necessary to many other jobs. Coworkers were like family, and the regulars were what kept me working!"
good,working overnights I do all the cleaning in the store. Make sure any updates the store receives are applied to the appropriate systems. However the store does not have enough employee's to cover the night shift.
good,"Usually you have regulars (customers you see everyday, every few days, or consistently at 10:42 AM on Tuesday, for example), a few people from the neighborhood, and the highway travelers. You're expected to hold a 30-second meaningful conversation as you work with people, which is understandable as people have their own agenda and places to be. Its an easy way to earn some money while getting to know the local jokers or the guys that come in late on their way home."
good,come in set up kitchen get deep fryers going and the chicken roasting set up prep table fry foods and make sandwiches and salads pull old food out put new food in and put expirations dates on it  when a customer comes take there order give them the order and after continue making sandwiches and salads sometimes I go to meat slicer and cut the meat for the customers towards the end of the day clean kitchen and machines and sweep an mob wash dishes  get everything done before shift is ended
good,"A typical day at work consisted of coming in turning the power on in the car wash, making sure the drying towels and dash towels were clean and ready to go, and wash cars until close, at close we would clean the car wash and do our cash drop at the end of the night. I learned team work is very important. My co-workers were nice to an extent and some were very rude. Hardest part of the job was having to do a safe drop in the middle of the shift and the most enjoyable part of the job was that I got to work with my friends and I made some new ones."
good,"I was hired as the store manager and started work on Day 1 after the purchase of several Green Lantern locations.  This is a very busy store in a great location.  I inherited the staff that Green Lantern had in place, most were very good employees and handled the transition pretty well.  The community didn't handle the changes as well and were very unsupportive in the early days.  Customers wanted things to remain as they had been.  Change was coming though, Casey's would be adding a full kitchen to this location, offering pizza and sandwiches."
good,"I had a bad experience. Management was self-serving, co-workers were non-supportive, learning to work there is a trial by fire. If you want to work there, I hope the people there are different."
good,Casey's offers a lot of flexibility in hours. Any job requires flexibility in job requirements and hours as well. Co-workers are friendly. Most difficult part of the job is working late hours and monitoring fuel pumps to avoid fuel drive offs.
good,My over all experience with working at Casey's was pretty good. My fellow employees and management were easy to work with and easy to talk to. The work was just the right amount but at peek hours were higher stress levels but  nothing too overwhelming.
good,"Management has favorites and treats other employee's different, co workers doesnt do work and makes you do everything."
good,could have been better. some other employees were lazy.  got let go due to a high risk pregnancy and was told that i could be re hired. went in when i was able to and they could not give me the hours needed
good,Casey's is a fast paced environment. It is a new store so it's still working on fine tuning. Management is a little strict and they ask for a lot but the job is fun.
good,A typical day at work is alright there is always something to do. I have learned new ways of doing things that gas stations didn't do when I had previously worked for other companies. The management is nice and hard working people. Co-workers are touch and go they sometimes have extremely bad attitudes but that seems to be every where you work. The hardest part of the job is the wages I receive I am unable to pay my bills and am going to have to try to find a  higher paying wage somewhere. The most enjoyable part is that I get to see people all day and don't have to look at the same people all day.
good,"did a lot of cash register,customer service cash handling cleaning stocking ,then went into the cooking part of the job,i did learn how to multitask a lot better the management was pretty good as for co workers found myself covering a lot of shifts for call ins but I didn't mind to much I got to see my customers more and made so many friends"
good,"I helped customers find the right devices for them and their families.  I handled customer issues, such as tech support, assisting them in paying their bills, setting up their emails, etc.  I handled cash by doing morning cash in's and nightly deposits, along with checking customers out.  I kept the store clean by vacuuming, dusting and washing windows.  I handled inventory on a daily basis, checking it in on the computer and then stocking our shelves.  I also answered the phone, took messages, scheduled appointments, checked and sent out daily emails, uploaded contracts and faxed documents as needed."
good,Nice place to work. Was give the opportunity to learn other duties. It was hard work at times but working with staff made it enjoyable.
good,"I wish I could say this was a drama free work place and that the management staff were professional, unfortunately I cannot. Other than the management and drama this is a decent place to work with decent wages."
good,"I worked part-time making pizza after lunch hours. It was not a difficult job, other than having to make multiple pizzas when orders piled up. I was the only one working and having to multi-task and make sure I made no mistakes. I didn't really have a problem doing so, and many people were very satisfied with the pizzas I made."
good,"caseys is a very busy workplace, the hours are strange. Some nights some days .Always busy I stock, order,run register do deposits ,open on weekends"
good,Make and prep pizza dough. Prep food for that day and the next day's use. Stock and rotate cooler. Unload truck. Take and prepare orders from customers.
good,I learned a lot about customer service and enhanced my management ability. I would with good people and felt like I was apart of the community.
good,"The job is fair, not difficult and not simple. A typical day is ruffly 7 hours long and goes by at a nice pace and you are kept busy the whole time."
good,Nothing too great. Friendly staff adn co workers. Don't expect getting too many hours. This is a job for high school students.
good,I enjoyed going to work everyday.  Helping customers was the most enjoyable part of the job.  When working 10 hour shifts; seemed like only 5 hours for me.  I learned how to manage currency at a fast pace and did so with confidence.  We had fun at work but maintained a professional atmosphere.
good,Management was a little to laid back but the workplace in general was productive and a fun environment
good,"Overnight shifts are pretty straightforward. You have to do things in a certain order because everything has to be out at a certain time. The hardest part of the job is learning to sleep during the day. Coworkers are alright for the most part, can be dramatic and gossipy, but harmless most of the time."
good,"Everyday seemed like a new day. I enjoyed the day-to-day"
good,"I would normally arrive 15 minutes early to see if the morning cook or cashier needed anything that their job required, I would always have a smile on my face and greet everyone as if they were family."
good,the company is continually expanding and is a fun work environment. Management is great at the store level but then tends to dwendle off as it moves up the chain of commant.
good,Responsible for managing large amounts of cash at poins and making safe drops. Managing a cash register and being accountable for it. Recording all money transactions and lottery transactions. I was trained in multiple areas of the building to be able to help when needed. It was a very customer friendly enviroment and the staff members were great to work with. I enjoyed working with my management. the hardest part of your job was standing on your feet for an entire shift. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know your customers on a regualr basis and building relationships with them.
good,Best part about the job was the ability to learn every area of the store.
good,"started at 4:30 am unless it was coming in to make donuts then it was 3:30 am . learned to make donuts also no one knew how to make donuts except the donut cook trained everyone .i like the job."
good,Worked overnight as a cashier. Management does or will not enforce consistent rules.
good,"I liked the work, upper management was non-existent and turned a blind eye to store issues."
good,"With this job, you could either be part of the kitchen staff, work the front register, or both. The job also included general housekeeping and stocking."
good,unfair to employees they played favorites with employees that they knew personally outside of work
good,"An ok place to work.  Some co-workers were good to work with some were not.  Corp. did not treat everyone the same. Small raise's, didn't send out paperwork out on time to cheat people out of insurance's."
good,The job description incudes customer service and sales experience. Working in the kitchen was also a responsibility. This included preparing food by the hour and placing it into a food warmer. It was also a duty to make Casey's pizza as the customers ordered them.
good,"Although some employees spend their time complaining of others it's a fun, hard-working group to be around. The hardest part of the job is really staying busy since the location is a small town. Some days are really slow and you'll have all of your side jobs done so time seems to go by slower than others.  The best part of the job is having a manager that is fun, knows what she's doing, and always has your back."
good,well there was workers that choose not to work so when i got there at 1230am i had a lot to do plus my stuff also management was told about the issue and choose not to do any thing but overall it was a good job
good,"Very good Bosses "
good,"I enjoyed waiting on the customers . We shared many laughs and smiles. All the co-workers got along most of the time . We always were short handed due to the manager 's drama and not hiring enough employees. Many quit due to her  dishonesty and management style .The hardest part of my job was long hours , standing on concrete 8hrs-12hrs a shift , and being able to wait on customers while trying to do bookwork at the same time. We didn't have breaks nor a designated break room. I learned many new computer skills , how to make pizza from scratch , how to use different kitchen equipment that I never had , how to use the lottery equipment ."
good,Caseys was good to work at management was good.  Work was good the consumers were always delightful.  I always loved going to work.
good,I would greet customers when they would enter the establishment.  Customer service is very important with this job where you want to make sure you provide excellent service so that you can get a repeat customer.
good,"always tried to do my best on making donuts , and pizzas ,i learned how to make pizzas , the job is kinda stressful due to me being pregnant. everyone kept to themselves and the hardest part of working there was trying to get every just right and the most fun part was when customers complamented me on how the pizzas were so good and how i made customers feel about my work .."
good,"work was busy, once you learned of your regular customer needs it was easy to get them in and out so you can help the next customer, my manager was awesome to work for and co-workers as well. nothing really hard about the job itself just as long as you knew what you were doing except when you have to deal with people that drove off without paying for their gas, then if you didn't watch them all the time you would get written up for it, the company would lose money and after the third time you would get fired. The company did not install camera's so we as the employees had to do that job.The most fun about the job was the customers and the people you worked with made the job enjoyable."
good,I work on the counter and in the Kitchen cleaning the pit was the hardest part of the job
good,its an ok job very friendly staff and well maintained and i worked more than 40 hours per week
good,"ran register and cooked. pizza orders, learned how to use a buffer."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company, would recommend them to anyone."
good,I did advance unto a management position however this was only to pay my way through college.
good,"Boring "
good,"My day typically started early in the morning. I made coffee, made sure everything was clean, and opened the store for business. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers. I enjoy interacting with people."
good,About half of my co workers don't do their jobs and get away with it half the time. The way I get treated at times. I don't enjoy going to work anymore. 
good,"Open store, turned off alarm system,  cooked got store set up to open, cooked food, ran registor, gave change back correctly, closed store counted drawer, some of the team members would as a team,  set ploygram to the store,  cleaned the cooler, stock put away correctly, I really enjoyed waiting on the customers"
good,"Loved working here, I had a GREAT crew we all worked well as a team except the store manager she wouldn't answer phone calls and was very rude to all of us, would schedule us 11 or 12 hour days but she would only work her 9 if you were lucky and go home, I just got tired of doing the store managers job and her taking all the credit for it and working all of us other employees like dogs. I tried to get the problem dealt with for almost a year and nothing ever got done, she was putting way to much stress on me and the pay was not worth putting up with it any more. "
good,When working at Casey's I worked the early morning hours and prepared the donuts and the breakfast. Had a lot of great co-workers and that is what made the job bearable.
good,"Part time job, interact with customers, assist when needed, enjoy working with people, customers as well as coworkers. "
good,The kitchen was always really busy with more than one person's amount of work. Management was difficult to relay issues to. Co-workers generally were easy to get along with. Learned how to run a pizza kitchen effectively.
good,"general convenience store work, cashier, food prep, gas pumps and what not. low income, no benefits."
good,"A typical day at work would have been: stocking products, cleaning the store, running the register, greeting the customers, and closing the store."
good,"Fun, energetic atmosphere that keeps you busy. The main tasks are keeping the store clean and stocked while providing great customer service. Multitasking is a must need skill."
good,"the management could be a bit of a pain at times, but its like that anywhere. it was a fairly fast paced environment but most of the people were friendly. there was room for minoor advancement."
good,"A typical day at Caseys was making pizza, making fresh pizza dough, prepping meats and vegetables, answering the phone and taking orders, and cleaning the kitchen. I learned how to make pizza, pizza dough, and make pizzas quickly and neatly. The management there wasn't the greatest but I could talk to them about any issues I had. I had awesome and hilarious night shift co-workers. I had a lot of fun with them at work! The hardest part of my job, at first, was making pizzas quickly. My trainer was very patient with me and showed me tricks on how he made pizzas fast and neat. The most enjoyable part was the customers and my co-workers. There was never a dull moment there!"
good,I was allways busy but again I like working with the public. The management was not up to par. She was rude and it was hard to work for her. The co-workers were very fun.
good,"Its fast paced, enjoyed my co-workers, the hardest part was that the company is not a fair place to work for I lose my job for the same thing the mangers do. No warning no nothing just let go an I think that's just wrong. best part of my job was my customers that came in every day that I waited on for 2yrs and the vendors that I got to know."
good,Learned how to time manage and service peoples request.
good,"I worked at casey's 1994,to 1998, kitchen and cashier. I woeked pancake ranch in bethalto 1982to1994,then super 8 hotel in alton. then casey's agin 2010 to 2011. kiten and cashier. iliked the housekeeping the best because I injoy the qwork."
good,A lot of work gets missed around here because it is so busy and there are not enough allotted hours
good,I enjoy working with my other co-workers. I enjoy being able to work with community.
good,"got to meet new people, some co- workers were better to get along with than others didnt really get along with the manager all that well"
good,Casey's was a very challenging place to work. I had learned many planning skills associated for that particular type of work.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working here, but some very disrespectful people which you will run into all the time. I made friendships out of my work experience. They taught me that no matter what happens that anything can go wrong."
good,Cash register. Sales of merchandise. Received Truck supplies. Love woking with public. End of day sales reports
good,"A typical day of work included overseeing 5-12 employees, dealing with customer complaints, accounts receivable and payable, inventory control, ordering, scheduling, and dealing with vendors. The best part of this job was the employees and the hardest part of the job was the management above me."
good,I liked Casey's because of all the fun people there. I didn't like it because even if you would come to work everyday they would find something wrong with what you did. I didn't like how they would write you up for the tiniest things.
good,Caseys is a very strong employer and are second to none in merchandising what they sell.They purchase only the finest ingredients for what they sell from their kitchens.
good,"made pizza, cleaned the kitchen, it was stressful when it was busy. it was a breeze when it wasnt. now im just trying to hit the 150 character minimum for an indeed review"
good,I loved working at Caseys. Work was fun and the regular customers were great. Overall great place to work. The manager was energetic and made the shift fun.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with managers and employees and teaching them new things and how to manage a profitable store."
good,I get to serve customers daily. Employees are great. I have learned to make all kinds of pizzas. I cook and dishes all shifts. I like being able to go some place daily.
good,"It was a good place to work, great for a high school kid to work at to make some extra cash. Very fast pace at times on weekends. Always plenty of work to do."
good,I have been working for Casey's for almost nine months now. I really don't care for the job anymore. There are fellow employees that will tell lies about you to get you in trouble. There is one employee that works in the kitchen that is mean and crude to all new employees. I even applied for an assistant managers position there and my name was not even considered.
good,30 to 40 hours a week. this job is fast paced and onlyy starts out at minimum wage. you will be required to work weekends and some overnights. job is stressful do to how busy it can get with food orders
good,I worked for Casey’s for almost 6 years it was my first real job and a pretty easy one. I would probably still be working there if they would have worked with me on hours. I think the manager would have but the district manager said no. My son was starting school and after working there 5 years they wouldn’t give me more first shift hours.
good,I worked for Casey's general store for 7 years. I enjoyed working with the public and I also enjoyed going into work every day. My boss was also amazing
good,"Ok place to work, pay could be a little more, managers are flexible also.benifits would be nice too. Or more of a raise per hour.the work is fast paced but it helps time go by always have something me do."
good,"I enjoyed the job as it pertained to customers. Management was very poor as they did not give annual reviews when due or raises. Also management had very little involvement in doing much at all around the store on a daily basis, or reprimanding employees whom did not perform their jobs as they should have."
good,Each location is ran so different. I don't feel each location is held to the same standards as the other. The only main benefit I saw was that as an employee you received free drinks in your employee cup while on shift and discounted food while on shift.
good,The job is really not that hard of a job it's just very tedious. They are usually good about working with you on hours. Just don't expect a weekend off but maybe ever 6 months or unless you ask for it off. You will also have to work the Holidays because they will not close even for Christmas you just heading into work later on in the day.
good,Working for caseys is ok unless you get robbed like i did. I got robbed 2 times and they claimed they was gonna pay me workmans comp and even sent me a letter saying so and never did. I returned after both of them and when i talked to human resources they told me i was back to work so it didnt matter anymore. But my boss is still awesome she helped me through a very tough situation.
good,"Not a bad part time job, minimum wage so it not a bad job to have on a side. Management was nice and understanding if you needed time off. Meet a lot of different people."
good,You will be working very long hours and it's really not enough money to put up with all of it especially when I could go down the road do half the work and get paid more and less hours.
good,There seemed to be a high turnover rate for store managers which brought different expectations and requirements making it difficult to keep up with..
good,The management could be better but very friendly. Its fast paced and the time goes by fast. Big problem with teamwork at the place but sparking some motivation is easy and helps a lot. Moving up is a challenge but not impossible.
good,This job is really meant for people who want to interact with other people on the daily. You need patience and be capable of kindness. Other than that you will constantly feel like your with a family working for caseys because thats the work environment they provide.
good,"I worked all shifts at one point and even doing overnights, I never felt unsafe. There were regulars that were constantly in and we got to know so if anything did happen, they'd be there to help. Coworkers were fun, but not very strict in keeping up with chores so some shifts had to do more to pick up the slack. Management would allow time off if given advance notice but you were responsible for finding a replacement if you were sick, and it was hard to find someone. The schedules were never regular, it went week by week."
good,It's fun to work there. My coworkers are friendly and are always willing to help out when needed. Casey's is also very flexible with the hours I needed.
good,"The management was awful. Managers were constantly quitting, so the turnover rate was pretty frequent. it created a chaos of different orders coming in. Most of the regular employees just did their jobs without supervision and ignored it."
good,"Great Starter Job, advancement is slim to none. Would recommend as a second job for anyone. The pay compared to competitors is not great. Otherwise, overall the environment is a great place to work, an individual can gain many work related skills."
good,As manager I would buy gift cards once a month to show my appreciation.  I treated staff and customers  as family. Casey's never showed  appreciation  for their staff.
good,"I liked some of the food at Casey's, but I understand why they cycle through so many people so quickly, sometimes the work isn't fun, and difficult, but beyond that I wasn't around good company."
good,Very busy fast pace environment. Turn over rate is typically high and mangers work a lot of hours. Some stores are 24 hour while others close throughout the night. supervisors are not always able to help and this makes management a bit more difficult.
good,"I did enjoy my time as a cook and cashier.  I learned a lot about customer service and management.  I wish they would pay their employees more.  If you wanted to advance in the company, more than likely, you would have to relocate."
good,"The work is simple, and the people you work with are okay. Management isn't very understanding about anything personal. I was fired when my brother was sick and actually ended up passing away. They were completely mean about it. But overall a positive work environment."
good,They ask a lout of you for little pay. Every day they want you to do more.  In the winter the employees have to go out and clear the parking lot by hand with a shovel.  Seems like they could pay someone equipped with the proper equipment to do it.
good,"There is always something to do. People need to be 18 or older to qualify. If 21 or older and willing, employees are cross-trained in all areas of the convenience store. This allows various skill developments and customer service experiences for future employment elsewhere."
good,"Work was good during the day, but after 5 in the evening, things got very stressful. Other employees and myself struggled to keep up providing service for the customers because so few employees were working. No one wanted to work the evening shift."
good,"Open store, check out customers, restock product/shelf. Clean. Handle money, count money, close out cash drawer.Currently under new management. Hardest part of job is no down time, break time, long hours on feet. Early hours. Most enjoyable is the customer relationships, helping customers, convience job, and flexible hours."
good,pretty easy job. not enough coworkers stayed. did not care for the manager. some employees didn't do there job making it harder for everyone else. Was a good place to work before they switched managers.
good,"I have worked here for almost a year. Chances of moving up the ladder are very small. No lunch break unless you work a shift over 7 and a half hours, which they won't schedule people outside of management for. Very cheap company regarding employees."
good,"Working at Casey's can be fast-paced and at times stressful. Not only do you have to run the register and make sure you get the gas pumps, but you also have to make sure 6 different coffees are made, shelves are stocked, trash is taken out, floors are swept and mopped in the store and restrooms, and make sure the other employees in the kitchen are caught up.  There might be times where you have to help do dishes or make food. You have to have excellent customer service."
good,"The hardest part is dealing with customers that don't want to follow state wide rules and regulations. I learned how to control my temper when dealing with those type of customers. There really is not a typical day, they are all different. My most enjoyable part was seeing my regular customers on a daily basis, and catching up with what was new."
good,"Overnight baking paid well enough, but the job was very lonely and repetitive. Both GM and Assistant manager quit without notice, store was in disarray afterwards. Generally easy job, but always short-staffed. Had to stay late because shift-relief was late multiple times. Hardest part of job was baking cake donuts, have to get it JUST right or they don't turn out. Best part was eating said cake donuts."
good,"I liked it very much when I first started, but after being there a while my boss was being weird, I had closed the store one night, an turned around came in the next morning to do donuts and when I didn't answer my phone on my day off my boss got mad at me. I didn't quite understand that."
good,"Well it was a decent job, working in kitchen is a bit hard when you get started with remembering what is need to be done each day. but a tip i would wait till summer hours start so there will be more hours after training."
good,"I really enjoyed my job as the store manager. It kept me very busy, and the pay was fair. Unfortunately, there is little to no support for store managers from upper management. They claim they are available and willing to help, but in reality they can not be bothered. Most of them will either not take calls or take hours to respond."
good,great atmosphere and a great stepping stone in my career. loved working here. I wouldn't stay there too long but great management experience and great management overall.
good,"Was overall a good job, minor problems included hours and pay. Worked with some great people and made a lot of friends. Fast paced and teaches you what working with food is like."
good,Working at Casey's General Store is a great entry level job opportunity. That said there is a lack of incentive to remain on with the company as an associate. There are no bonus opportunities for associates and the possible annual raise opportunity caps out at twenty-five cents. You would be better off searching for a job paying a dollar an hour more than staying on at Casey's indefinitely unless you are pursuing a role as higher management.
good,"Fun great work invironment. -The company allows you to feel a sense of worth. You get opportunities to truly make the company a better place."
good,"This job isn't bad if you really need money. Otherwise, it's not worth the stress. Coworkers and management don't care and you will be overworked with no payoff at all. Managers don't care if you bend over backwards for people, even to the point of spending your own money. Even if you are the best worker at the store, you won't get much of a raise at all. Managers don't know how to do their job."
good,I worked in the kitchen before I left the store the hours were ok and sometimes the customers were difficult but most generally it was a good place to work at.
good,"Good people to work with and lots of customer interaction. If you enjoy working with people and having plenty of time to yourself, then Casey's is the place for you."
good,"Lots of overtime, long days, Dishes, make and prep pizza, clean bathroom & store floor and outside, great co workers, discount food, hot interment, uniform"
good,I have been managing a long time and I've seen many things. it's a good company to work for if you are willing to deal with a lot of stress. You have to unload you own delivery truck instead of the driver's unloading it for you.You have to come back to work after your shift to unload truck every week. The pay is good but balancing life and work is not good if you are the manager.
good,"Each store is ran differently, even though there is a set way the company requires them to operate. Some employees work hard, while others do next to nothing."
good,The manager is extremely understanding when it comes to you needing days off however I was hired on to work 18 hours a week and ended up working around 28 to 30 sometimes even 40+ so I began to struggle in school. When I brought up my issue three times nothing was done about it.
good,the job itself was not difficult IF there was enough people scheduled to keep up with the busy times. however you could go above and beyond your job requirements and they would still expect more.
good,"Fun place to work, not a career.  Not much pay and no benefits unless you are management.  The District Managers are not friendly and no one wants to see them enter the store."
good,Working at Casey's is alright and can be fun depending on your job preferences. If your a social person than this is a great job for you. Management given what area you are in can very from good to bad and the guys at the corporate offices are terrible. However I much enjoyed my time at Casey's other than constantly working as store manager.
good,"When I was working for Casey's, even if it was for a mere month, I learned how to handle a fast paced environment and how to help customers in a friendly and respectful manner."
good,"worked donut shift 3am-10am most of the time, until promoted to assistant manager, after becoming assistant manager took care of payroll, books, lottery counts, and cash counts, ran to the bank, all the manager things without the manager pay. worked 7 days a week most of the time, some days worked 21 hours then came back in 3 hours later, too many people called in and others refused to come in"
good,I worked for Casey's for a few years.  I started as an assistant manager and a year later promoted to store manager and given my own brand new store.  They love promoting within but at the same time terminate employees for unfair reasons.  The management can be in the wrong but the employee gets fired type of thing.  They don't provide sufficient help for store managers.  I worked 390 days straight with 40 employees and no assistant.
good,"Casey's compensates their employees very well.  Typical day varies depending on which position you fill.  A management day entails doing fuel pump security, daily books, inventory counts, cleaning and delegating duties to employees.  I've learned more about cigarettes and tobacco than ever anticipated.  Fast paced and hospitable culture.  The hardest part of working for Casey's is finding reliable staff.  The best part is helping your customers have a good day."
good,Good place to work. I love my job but my store is closing so I am getting demoted. Thinking maybe I should try to find something different were I can go up not backwards
good,"Casey's was a pretty easy job with somewhat repetitive tasks. I learned a little bit about customer service and dealing with issues customers had. Management consisted of nice understanding people who were easy to get along with. My co-workers were all pretty easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was just dealing with the rushes that would come during the weekends, especially if we were short staffed. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to accomplish tasks while talking to my co-workers."
good,Typical days was really busy.  Learned how to make amazing pizzas.  Immediate management was always really fun and easy to work along side. Co-workers were often times lazy so I took the time to do their job too.  Hardest part of the job was the hours.
good,"Working for Casey's was great at first, but then it became my whole life. I worked more than I was home because I was nice enough to cover shifts for those who didn't want to go to work."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of answering customer requests, preparing and serving food to the customer, and working together with my manager. I have learned a lot from working here. This job was my first job and with it I have learned all the basic necessary skills that are required in the work force such as time management, respecting leaders, becoming a leader yourself and being responsible for your tasks and completing them efficiently. My manager is a great manager and a wonderful person, she went out of her way and helped me get a car on her time off. The hardest part of the job would have to be the rushes, but I work well under stress. The store has 3 phones, and at times during the busy weekends, we would have all 3 ringing and people in the store placing orders as well. I worked quickly to give quality food at a convenient time, never did the quality of what I was preparing waver through the rushes. I loved this job. I love working with people and having friendly customers. The job could be challenging at times and I love being challenged so those were my favorite days."
good,"some workers acted as if they were still in high school with all of the little kid drama, it made it almost an annoying work place environment."
good,"Going in cashiering or in the kitchen. Stocking, prepping food making pizzas, stocking coolers, cleaning and making sure customers are sarisfied with their services. Learned how to ran a cash register and making pizzas. Management is great thier friendly and help you out when needed. My co-workes are nice and friendly for the most part they do what they need to do. The harest part of the job is not getting enough hours. The thing I enjoy most Is getting to know the community."
good,"A great place to work, especially since I had just moved into the area. Great way to meet new people of my community. This was originally my main source of income but then as I advanced in my career it became my second source. I didn't want to leave just because I found another job."
good,I loved the customers and the co workers were ok. I liked the work its self it was easy to learn and every day was very similar. Working at two locations in two states I know that each store is run differently . Some mangers are better than others.
good,"Making pizza, and preparing topping for Casey's famous pizza. I also stock the cooler and take care of outside the facility."
good,"As a 1st Assistant Manager my jobs are to oversee all employees.  Answered customers' questions and addressed problems and complaints in person and via phone. Opened and closed the store, which included counting cash drawers and making bank deposits."
good,"it was a nice place to work but some of the people think that u should do their job also.  Nothing was easy for me I do have a little bit of a learning disablity, which that company frowns on."
good,"I was a cashier, cook unloaded trucks adn stocked shelves. I learned that teamwork gets more done. Co-workers became friends and are still friends. I enjoyed getting to see everyone that came into the store."
good,The co-workers are great. Fun to be around! Also great small town atmosphere. Loved having regulars come in!
good,"Enjoyed interaction with customers and employees.  Revolving door for cashiers and kitchen help except for small core of dedicated help. Needless -to-say always interviewing and hiring. Managers are required to work cashier duties for 7 of the 9 hours required each day, so depending on volume of customers it was difficult to get all required manager duties done in allotted time.  Many long days."
good,"The work isn't that hard; mostly common sense. Management is ok but there is very little seen of the general manager unless you work days, which is her shift. The hardest part of the job is people; the best part of the job is people. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get along with co-workers and management. When everyone concentrates on their job and does well is my favorite part."
good,"-A typical day at work consisted of pizzas and the occasional phone going off for people who want delivery."
good,"Once you get the hang of making pizzas, and running the register not to difficult. See lots of customers some on first name basis. Some employes get a little stressed and not very many people to call if your sick to work for you."
good,"My opinion of Casey's general store , specifically store number 1734 in Granite Falls, Mn, was one of mild contempt.  As I am an employee that does more than is expected on a regular basis it was frustrating to have workloads that should have been compensated by other employees doing what was required of them on each of their shifts.  It was a safe work environment though certain co-workers were the type to back-stab or gossip about one another which was not something I appreciate.  The customer relationships were always normal to good depending on the time of day I was scheduled or varying from person to person.  Customer flow was moderate compared to inner city work of the same position yet there were a few employees and even the manager who were easily stressed by a line of customers usually stating something to the effect of how busy it was.  "
good,The benefits at this job is great and if you have the experience and the openings are available you will advance pretty quick.
good,I have to be at work at 4 a.m to get things ready to open at 5 a.m.
good,I enjoyed meeting and greeting new people. I liked the organization of the kitchen and the prospects of working our own schedule.
good,"Well when i first started i was hired on almost instantly and that was helpful and I always asked what i could do next which impressed the guy that was training me. Well as time would go on, the manager that hired me would just no longer show up cause corporate was making her work long hours and we kept losing people as well so that was taxing on all of us (and even before she left there was a point i had to work 32 days straight) and even had to run my kitchen and train a register person and at that time i only knew how to run the register not close it down. Eventually 2 months later we get a new manager and i thought things were going to be looking up and improving, but unfortunately that would not really be the case. While she was trying to learn the store and the workers who had stayed around. Well after about 2 months somehow i was the one who had to make all the dough, cut veggies, make like 50% more food, always made sure i wouldnt leave a mess for the next shift, and still try to help the new kids at the register cause the manager had to do her paperwork and bank stuff and usually took her whole shift or having to stay late but i mean it wasnt all bad, i was pretty chummy and well known and told that i make very good pizza, which was always nice to hear."
good,Moving up takes worth but the benefit of working hard and earning that is what makes it worth it. I started third shift and moved on to management through hard work
good,It is a good company to work for with room for improvement. Also if you work hard there is room for you to move forward in the company . Really the management staff is really good but I guess that all depends on location.
good,Enjoyed my job. Corporate decisions aside. Management generally good. Crew fun to work with. Several very competent employees on staff. Some not so much
good,Over all corporate hour cuts are what makes working for Casey's store stressful even if you have a great management and employee crew. Love my customers and they deserve best.
good,"Friendly customere, good place to work, easy job, alot of stuff to do, great environment, small town feel, fast pace job, great food, great sodas, alot of items"
good,It’s a very “meh” place to work. It’s a gas station so if you’re looking for something to further you or to make you feel like you’ve accomplished something then it’s not the place for you. But the pay is good and the days fly by.
good,"make donuts and pizza's, while cashiering and maintaining inventory. Management was ok and the work place was clean and safe. I really enjoyed making food, so that made the job fun."
good,Casey’s general store was a great experience. Even though the company had various problems. The environment kept the store relaxed. Everyone got along well.
good,"Typically, the expectations of Casey's is pretty easy though it can be stressful with a full line at the registers and backed up in food orders.  The staff at my current location consists of those I've known since childhood.  The regular customers give a sense of community."
good,Great people but always short staffed overworked and under paid. So alotof the times staff would be tired and short with others including the customers.
good,It was a good place to work with not bad pay i worked on the night shift and it wasnt to hard but i did have a lot to do and i was always busy helping someone
good,Good place to work at. Always have to be on time. Always have to work hard. Always have to pay attention. Make sure everything is Stocked and cleaned every night.
good,Good work environment employees are awesome i loved making people smile  fast going and delicious food a very good company to work for they have great benifients and 401K
good,If your looking for a place to begin a career without having a college degree & don't mind working hard to achieve it then Casey's might be a good place for you. It may or may not happen quickly but it can be gratifying. The higher up you go the better the package gets. You need to like customer service or this is NOT the job for you on any level. Must like working in a team environment.
good,"Good benefits, lots of room for advancement. Working at Casey's was like gaining a second family. They offer many different shifts. They generally compensated fairly well."
good,"Casey's is a very complex company to work for, on a typical day starts at 5 am. It is very hands on job and time consuming. "
good,"It was tough to work up to 5 hours by yourself in the kitchen when busy all the time.   Manager adds extra jobs to perform because some employees mess around too much but the one that works hard gets overloaded.   Loved the regular customers, had a great time talking to truck drivers, and enjoyed the environment for the most part."
good,Very laid back at times but then very busy and stressful at times at my store as people would leave stuff to do for the next shift. Not all stores are like this.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at Casey’s and I would go back if I could, good  management  And good coworkers,, the only thing I didn’t like is you could close and then have to be back early in the morning"
good,"Not the best, but I made some good connections. I wish the management had been a bit harder on some of my coworkers where not nice to others, such as myself."
good,"Casey's is a great company in a competitive industry as convenience store and QSR (Quick Serve Restaurant). A typical day at work would include mentoring team members, creating reporting for leadership and digital transformation meetings.  Some days can be stressful, however I have established relationships among my leadership and peers."
good,I worked there during my senior year of night school. They’re pretty flexible with your hours and days. They worked with me when I had to have ankle surgery.
good,"Working for Casey's in one of the convenience store is one of those jobs that a person may take to fill gaps in their income, like I did. It's the bog standard in customer service experiences, with everything you might expect being in that field. While it's not the perfect job, I haven't come across one that is perfect either. Usual duties include cash handling, store cleaning, taking down license plate numbers of pump approvals, those sorts of things. Alternatively, you may end up in the kitchen, making pizzas and sandwiches to sell to customers."
good,Working for my particular Casey's store can be very stressful. We are exceptionally busy and need to go go go. The management is very hands-on to assist with getting work done. Co-workers are generally polite and sympathetic to one-another. In fact I find my coworkers to be the best part of working here.  The hardest part is keeping up with the ever shifting schedule as I may be needed to fill in at any time due to shortage of staff.
good,"fun place to work but stressful, lots of lifting and fast paced, not a good job if you allready have back health issues.other then that it is a fun place to work, especially if you enjoy meeting new people'"
good,"Fun place to work. Very laid back. But, Management was very poor. Not good at scheduling. Promised hours that i never got. Only got scheduled 1 day a week when promised 3 to 4 days a week. Hired to many people for our store. Not professional what so ever. Very messy all over interview."
good,"You always have something to do at Casey's. If you are not waiting on a customer at the register or in the deli/pizza area, you are cleaning and stocking. Plenty of job advancement if you want it."
good,"Excellent place to work on your own. Must be able to work at a quick pace, and a quick learner. Team work is an absolute must. Management is great with working on schedule conflicts."
good,I loved my job and the people I worked with.  There was very minimal accountability for ones actions or for management.  Employees and management did not treat customers the way they should be.
good,"The hardest part is working in the kitchen all the time, but working at the counter is nice because you get to interact/help people as the day goes on."
good,"Would not be first choice for job as I have worked this environment before but all in all is a good place to work, they do offer benefits, is a friendly atmosphere, very busy, fast paced"
good,"type of day in the life at Casey is you get to work  cashiering and in between that you need to stock  shelf's make coffee empty garages."
good,I enjoy working at Caseys they are a great company with very good benefits. I have been with the company for over 10 years and although I love doing what I do the downfall is being salary and still working 30 or more  hours over my​ set schedule.
good,"I have been working at caseys for a little over a year but took time between two different locations. When I took time to find a better job when I came back to caseys in October I had to start all over with the wages. I am asked to train new people, work hard (even though other employees get paid more and do nothing) and the management doesn't hold people accountable."
good,It's a great starter job but management needs to be reassessed.  Better safety especially in the kitchen and stocking the cooler.  More efficient training as well would really benefit the customer and employee.
good,Past paced evening shift. Morning shift more relaxed but busy as well. Lots of prep work for toppings and other food. Laid back atmosphere with manager and day shift staff.
good,I should of stayed it's was a great job help me stay out of turble and stay I school I really love that job but I had to move out of town with my family.
good,"While the pay is not great, the job is not rocket science either. I do have a lot of fun with co workers, and have developed a relationship with regular customers. That is what keeps me going back. The company does offer great benefits if you stay with them for a long time, and there is room for advancement if you really want it."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Casey's, providing excellent customer service; I was terminated and upon applying for unemployment benefits, the manager lied to the hearing judge.Turnover is horrible at all the stores that I have visited"
good,Not a bad place just a couple that didn't want to do their job and one was working in the kitchen on one of the busiest nights and was never trained. me being the new person got blamed for the backup and delay when in fact wasn't me being the problem. the one was only trained for register not kitchen but yet was allowed to work kitchen.
good,"A great place to work if you love helping people and meeting new people.  A lot of fun, but can be VERY stressful sometimes."
good,"Loved my manager and coworkers. As far as upper management goes, well you are just a number to them. Safe and friendly environment to work in."
good,"I like Caseys. Its close to home, my manager is a nice laDY, WHO UNDERSTANDS WE HAVE A FAMILY OUTSIDE OF WORK. WE WORK TOGETHER TO FIX ANY PROBLEMS."
good,"working there you are expected to know all the different jobs and duties. such as making doughnut very early in the morning to making pizza until late evening, as well as running a cash register until at least 11 at night. i know some stores are 24 hours as well.  pretty rough deal about breaks, they force you to write down each break to cover their behinds against law suits for not allowing ample break time but very rarely can you actually take a full 20 min break.  Most stores only have 2 people working at a time so one person must do everything while the other is on break, which most of the time is not possible to do and still provide good customer service.  Like many other gas stations, some customers will be very rude and not treat you will respect, not possible to make everyone happy.  Having thick skin makes this job much easier"
good,Ok place to work at. Some benefits and some room for advancement.
good,"I cooked and prep. food. The co-worker were good for the most part. The job was very easy,almost to easy."
good,I liked working for this company because they believed in paying a decent wage to their employees but didn't believe in training.  Fast paced is the term that I would use for this company.
good,I really enjoyed Caseys but my work schedule was not good with my young children at the time. 
good,"work the registers , stocked shelves, checked in product on a weekly schedule, enjoyed working with the young personal we had as pizza makers, donut makers. Hardest part was working every night and only getting minimum wages for the work."
good,"Typical job, employees were friendly, supervisor were reasonable but job is stressful when it comes to customers driving off with gas"
good,Work at Casey's is fun I like my co workers and my manager the pay could be better for some of us but love me job. I love my customer and I am to please.
good,Caseys is a store that would be a great first time job. For someone who is new to the working industry their is little to none room for moving up in the company
good,I advanced quickly when I started at Casey's. I started out as a kitchen help and within 6 months was promoted to kitchen Manager. My store manager was awesome and allotted me to get as many hours as I needed. She was fair and always communicated in a professional manner when there was a problem
good,"While some management and staff are satisfied woth the minimum, many coworkers and management staff work their hardest to provide a healthy and enjoyable work enviornment for all employees"
good,"Obviously not a position for someone over 30 unless you are desperate. Management doesn’t reprimand all employees, only certain ones. Kitchen is always nasty."
good,"A regular day would involve taking orders and completing them as fast and correct as possible. Cleaning the kitcken was an every day task. Doing the dishes, sweeping the floor, taking out the trash, and more. I learned that teamwork is key. It could make or break any business. Management plays a big role in my opinion. If the management is good then the store runs well. I wish i could say that about the store that i work at. We are fragile to be straight to the point. Not enough workers and it burns out the other workers. Really never got stable in my time there. The culture there was alright. I worked with classmates from high school, which made the job better. The worst part was to leave stuff unfinished for the next person. The best was when everything was cleaned and prepared on time."
good,"enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Nothing about Caseys is hard. I waited on customers, stocked, cleaned. The manager was not bad , stressed a lot"
good,"They will use you and drain every ounce of energy and enthusiasm from you. When you can no longer be their go to person, they turn cold and careless. If you step down to take care of your family or yourself, you are pushed out the door by hours being cut."
good,"At Casey's there are rushes that can usually be calculated in time. I've learned a lot about leadership and how to work with little to no guidance. The crew at Casey's is like a little family, even some of the customers are like family."
good,"working at caseys was ok I don't really know what to say. the people where great to work with for the most part . overall it was an experience that I would consider again, no promises"
good,I worked for caseys several times under different management for a total of 2 years. The first manager was very strict and to guidelines. The store was 24 hours and I was on overnight donut shift in the kitchen and on register. Register is very slow paced on week nights and can be stressful on weekends. Pay was 50 cents more for that shift which isnt enough by any means. Lots of detail to customer service is a must and being on first name basis with regulars makes the work environment run smoothly. The second manager i worked for was a mess and should not have been in that position. Turnover was a problem as was a lot of workpkace drama but being pizza cook/sub station worker was a busy job so it really wasnt bad. The last manager I worked for worked with employees and had a bubbly good natured personality. It makes workers want to work harder and do their job when treated with respect and having a friendly manager that will still lay the law down. The biggest  problem with Caseys Corporation is that they don't pay enough. Minimum wage is okay for high school students or people without families and large bills. Unfortunately even though you cross train and can do many things to make you necessary around the store plus do as much extra as you can it is rare that you get any kind of raise or acknowledgement for your efforts or for the amount of time you've been there. Customer appreciation is always at a high level but appreciating your employees is also important. When minimum wage raises your wages stay the same as long as they're not under the minimum wage no matter how long
good,It was a nice job loved every minute. Wish it was still 24hrs like before because now all the work hours got cut down. But that’s pretty much the only con about the job
good,"It's a fine place to work if you're just needing some money on the side. Unless you make it into management, and even then, I would not consider it as a job to try to raise a family on."
good,"Worked 4pm - 11pm most of the week, sometimes worked morning when the supply truck arrived.  Must be able to lift and push heavy items.  I loved working with the customers, I enjoy customer service a great deal.  The store I worked at cross trained all the employees which is a terrific idea.  Everyone worked very well together. Raises were terrible and salary was very little to be desired.  The employees in the home state are treated better than the southern states."
good,"Casey's is well known in a few states, their customers are loyal and happy, I got to know a lot of different people and loved working in the kitchen ensuring food safety and customer satisfaction."
good,It was in a small town and I was the manager. The pay wasn't good and it was hard to get employees. I had 5 faithful employee's that were great workers. I worked 60 to 80 hours a week for a small salary.
good,Casey's General Store was a job that helped me develop better social skills by interacting with customers on a daily basis. It was a fairly easy job to do.
good,"I worked the overnight shift i enoyed it i prefer working alone, and this gave me the opportunity to work by myself, and the pay was wonderful, wish i could go back."
good,"When I started there I was the mom of 6 month old, nursing, infant. Looking for a job that cared that my child was breastfed was hard. Casey's offers benefits for moms that nurse such as the ability to take a break if someone brought my son up and we were not busy. I loved that! What I did not love was the management. Bad management causes angry/upset customers which causes angry/upset  employees."
good,It's hard because you get no breaks except for a brief 5 min break every 2 hours.  In a 8 hour shift it gets hard.  The community is great though
good,"typical day at work would be 5-8 hours on the register. Not many duties, just simple chores like cleaning, stocking, and helping customers. Management is decent. Co-workers are friendly. Hardest part of the job would be keeping people happy while making sure you don't offend anyone or make them feel incompetent. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be making people smile."
good,"Being an employee a Casey's has allowed me to heighten my customer service skills and provide me with another chance to advance. Every day is pretty situational. The idea is just to stay level headed and handle each and every scenario as well as it can be, with the staff and equipment available. I usually do books, take deposits to the bank, talk to employees about any new events that I have missed on my days off  and if everything goes smoothly, finish my tasks and continue on to assist others in theirs. "
good,different stores run in different ways people are fun and enjoyable
good,Casey's General Store is a company that has lots of room for advancement. I would recommend to anyone looking for a job to apply at this company. I myself started off as a part time donut cook and am now currently Assistant Store Manager. The hardest part of my job is dealing with associates that miss work and finding associates to cover those missed shifts.
good,"I worked nights and weekends, it was fast paced and overall steady."
good,"It's a friendly work environment. They hire a lot of young kids who call in a lot and make it harder on everyone else. I did find out other found my job, in a smaller town.Were being paid almost $2 more than I was"
good,"Good second job or for someone not needing to provide for a family. Work life balance is a far fetched idea in retail unless your PT and set your own hours, if you need full time give it up your gonna work all over the stores open hours."
good,"It was a fun place to work just need better management. Employees were great, food was great, work was easy. Nice relaxed place to work .  Great discount for employees"
good,"The job itself is very fun and relaxing, becomes stressful at a 24 hour store working double shifts and not having covers and being called in all the time. The employees seem to be full of drama and make the workplace environment extremely hard to enjoy."
good,Following Dailey chore list. Customer service skills are needed. Standing the whole shift. Making good food for customers to eat. Working with the manager to make sure all shifts are covered. Doing prep work for next shift or day
good,"when i started at this job i felt like i was home, but thats about it. i had great co-workers and the over all job was fun if i could go back i would but id go to a different store for the manager at the store i worked is a bit mean at time to her employees."
good,"Productive days, always had something to do. Learned something new most days. The hardest part of the day was having to clean up after the shift before me, and the most enjoyable part of the day was coming up with my own pizzas."
good,"My job requires me a lot of interaction with customers. I mostly work in the kitchen where I am responsible for all of the food made at Caseys General Store. I am also responsible for keeping the kitchen clean and organized as well as keep track of temperatures. I used to be a full time cashier before the stores hours got cut to no longer being a 24 hour store. I rang up almost every customer that came into the store, kept the store clean and organized, I was responsible for all customers paying for fuel inside and preventing drive offs. I was also responsible for all monies going in and out of the safe during my shift. I have done freight as well and have experience checking product in."
good,This job is very fast pace. The job and how the day will go depends on who is working during that shift. It was alright but not something to do for the rest of someone's life.The town is also not the greatest.
good,Great coworkers easy going laid back job great for just to get back on your feet but not a long term thing would recommend for someone trying to start over
good,I enjoyed my job. Loved working with the public. But its still about the money company dont care about there people when there is a blizzard to close stores
good,"I have worked at 4 stores. All of them are different. Two of the stores I worked at, we all worked good together. Two other stores I worked at had too many lazy people there and it made it hard on the ones that worked hard."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and enjoyed my co workers, but the pay felt very defeating. 15 cent raises annually are pretty poor and starting at minimum wage that would take 10 years to get a $1.50 raise."
good,"alwasy busy and always something to do, The people i worked with usually made it a fun place to be, i enjoy a more busy environment so i wont get bored and distracted"
good,"There was advancement, pay was average(7.75 per hour) I enjoyed working with the other associates, the manager was very calm and relaxed, even in pressure"
good,"Typical day would start with driving around town at 4am checking other places gas prices. Then into the store to do daily bookkeeping, and set up to open the store. We do daily audits, check in venders, customer service. Then depending on the day schedules, orders, stocking, cleaning projects, display projects."
good,"At 4:00 am I would start my shift. To start I would begin with making the donuts from already pre made donuts to the cake donuts I would have to mix up myself to the making of the cookies and other pasteries. Then onto making the breakfast pizzas, crassont sandwichs and biskets & gravy."
good,I took this job in October and I love my co workers and I have a pretty fair work schedule. I have every other weekend off and that is nice. And I like to open the store.
good,"The lack of communication is what killerhos for me , i loved the people i worked with but the manager had horrible communication , could be very rude not only to me but customers too"
good,"Caseys is a great place to work. Good hours, paid breaks and a relaxed manager. They work great on hours with you & the people are easygoing. Someone's always able to help."
good,Daily you would stock the cooler. Also had to prepare food for customers. You get to know your customers and they become like family. Often you learn their orders.
good,"I believe we should receive more compensation for all we are expected to do.  Other than that, Casey's is not a bad place to work.  I get along with my co-workers."
good,I do cashing stocking cleaning  kitchen time to time when needed u get the hours u need good job it can get kinda busy at times but it will make the time go fast
good,Productive always something to do. Get to utilize your customer service skills constantly as there are customers in the store constantly. Fast paced at times.
good,The pay is not good i have been trying to get full time and cant. They pick favorites and I want more for my kids than to have a mother struggle. I want to do something i love and make more money.
good,"There wasn't much organization or order, and people were always quitting or not showing up so it was a bit stressful and everyone else would have to pick up their hours so there would be 60-70 work weeks all the time."
good,"i went to work in the evening and delivered pizzas, helped the kitchen, and stocked coolers."
good,"It isn't a bad job, but unfortunately at this location they do not do very good scheduling. They didn't add any extra staff for holidays, scheduled employees alone at high sales times, and did not split holidays up evenly between all crew."
good,"The work was pretty easy, it can be slow at times, but really steady and busy as well. You get a discount on your meal when your working as well as free fountain pop"
good,Just stressful and not worth it at all. If they paid their employees more and gave them free meal when they work then thay might have good empployees.
good,"I would clock in and count the money in the safe and the drawer to make sure the worker's leaving before me numbers were right. I'd then write the number on the scratch offs before I opened my drawer. I would proceed to wait on customers,stock the shelves, make sure everything was stocked and front faced and the dates were still good. I would also clean the store from the counters to the bathrooms, empty the trash and do the laundry. As my co-worker who comes in to take over he/she would watch me count down my drawer, make sure the safe was right then finally count down the cash register to make sure all of our numbers matched."
good,Very hard on employees and expect you to drop your life to work hours you didn't have. Management isn't the best because they are not understanding of your schedule or kind about you asking time off in advance.
good,All the sandwiches are pretty basic you learn them very fast and pizzas are about the sameyou usually have the same customers come in everyday . Friendly place
good,it was not a bad place at all to work. the manager was pretty rude.  I was pregnant and she would make me cry saying i wasnt moving fast enough or that i really sucked. my coworkers were the only reason i stayed as long as i did they were pretty great
good,Had I had a different manager this would have been a great job starter job for me for being a single mom who lived down the street. The manager was recently fired and that’s really all I need to say.
good,Good food great employees and over all experience was awesome I love the manager they care about you and how things are going at work they care about cleanliness
good,Wasn't a huge fan of working here. I was constantly put on doubles and the manager I had was not a very nice person. Other than that everything else was fine.
good,The job itself is easy enough. During busy hours though it can become stressful. Advancement here is slow and never promised. The pay is low but it is a good job for a second job.
good,the job itself was fine however my hours were severly cut so i quit. i loved the people who trained me and i would have stayed but only getting 1 shift in to weeks wasnt worth it
good,"My day was to run the register or cook, unload the truck every week. Work in the coolers every day or night, serve customers"
good,"I loved the customers, I loved my job there. I loved the hours and the ability as a part of management to be able to pull as many hours as I needed. "
good,"Great company, I enjoyed my job and coworkers until a management position opened up at a new store. I was first in line and highly recommend for the job. The assistant manager bullied me in the work place, she even created scenes in front of other employees and customers. In the end the district manager lied and falsified events to push me out. Every single one of my coworkers stood up for me and confronted management about the assistant managers actions toward me, management turned it around on me and said that I intimidated those employees to stand up for me. Yeah right! While working there I was 125lbs and 5’2, most of my employees were men that were two or three times my size. I didn’t intimidate anyone."
good,"A typical day at my store was a good hour long rush early morning, lunch, and dinner time. We had a great group of employees who worked very well together. I had been asked to start a peer to peer box in which i think really helped motivate the other employees into working hard and helping each other out more;while getting rewarded for their actions."
good,"I used to LOVE my job. Now that I have been promoted I hate it. I have no work life balance, the hours are terrable and they keep cutting the hours the store can schedule. As an assistant they do not allow me to do much more than I was able to working part time. I also work a week of opening then a week of closing and 8- 3 the weekend between and only make a little more than I did being part time. I have small children in school that I go a week at a time barely seeing. And now that hours have been cut they expect way to much to be done and dont allow the staffing they need to get it done. Overall I feel like the company doesn't really care much about their employees. You also can only qualify for a raise once a year and it's a maximum of 25 cents. That is something you manager decides. It could be nothing or 5 cents or 25 cents."
good,Casey's was a fun enviroment but didn't offer me much advancement and also i was forced to relocate because of personal issues. But it's an ok job just didnt pay enough.
good,This was an okay place to work for. They made it hard for people to advance with the company. I don't know if it was more corporate or store mangers fault.
good,"Was not consulted about major changes"
good,"Go to work by 3 am, start ovens, fryer, get donuts on pans and through ovens. Mix the doughnut mix and get thru fryer. Get breakfast ready for 5 am opening. Warmer food needs to be changed every hour so get new sandwiches and pizzas ready for the next hour. Wash and clean behind myself. Get off work at 9 am. Hardest part of this job is the pay. I work 30 hours a week at $11/hour. It's very hard to make ends meet with these variables. I do enjoy working in the kitchen."
good,It was a fun place to work but it wasn't enough pay to survive on. There were unfair advancements among co-workers and basically a dead end job ultimately.
good,I didn't like it their really well couldnt keep and manager. I like to help then costumer's . didn't like the location where it was at. Didn't really feel safe working 3rds
good,"The job itself was very fun and great, the management on the other hand was very unprofessional and difficult to work with"
good,Casey's is a convenience store where the main position I was involved in was cashier/sales associate. A typical day would be seeing over 100+ customers and helping them find suiting products as conveniently as possible. I really enjoyed the interaction with our regular customers or even people from out of town interested in Nixa/Ozark and Springfield's places to visit. I improved on my communication and ability to help customers.
good,Hard to keep the hours guaranteed. Hours Changed weekly! General Scheduling is Ok but does not work overall for people needing a regular schedule. Due to needing daycare!!
good,"The work was easy going and enjoyable, but the equipment was old and inefficient."
good,"I didn't mind the job. I liked that it was somewhat fast paced so the time flew by. I had many responsibilities at once and I didn't mind it at all. A typical day at work was that I would come in at 6am and make coffee and get the register ready. I would make the teas and do the paperwork for the lottery tickets. When the doors opened, I would have to take care of the customers and make sure the coffee is always made. I learned how to multitask and do what was needed in a timely manner and sometimes have time left over to help someone else out. Management was not organized when I worked there. It didn't seem like there was good communication between the three managers and the employees. On top of that, they were very rude. The hardest part of the job is when the coffee was constantly running low and you'd have a line of customers ready to check out and other things would need to be stocked at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was fast paced and made time fly by."
good,The hardest part of this job was being away from my infant at night. I love working with the customers and making pizzas. I had a lot of regulars who enjoyed me as the cook.
good,I learned a lot about the knowledge of cake decorating witch I really enjoyed. The hardest part about working there was remembering all the different types of bread.
good,"- Fast paced"
good,Working at caseys was a rough time for me because everything was unorganized we never had all the products to impress our customers or give what our customers wanted. We were out of everything all the time and it was like that for the year i was there.
good,i didnt really like it. the management in there was not really that good. my sister and the managers daughter had some problems and she brought it to work and stopped giving me hours.
good,"there is a lot of drama started by the employees, good employees are hard to find. although I cannot speak for all caseys, ours does not have too many good workers. a lot of our workers start issues and don't do their own jobs, all while complaining about what others are or are not doing."
good,"cashier customers, help assist customers to find items. cook food, prep food, serve food, deliver food., cleaning stocking shelves open store and close store"
good,"nice place to work easy training.standing on feet . cash register, money handling food making stocking and maintaining stores cleanliness food prepping parking lot swept trash ect."
good,Very fast place working place when busy. This place taught me a lot about food illnesses and what to do to prevent illness. They are willing to teach if you are willing to learn but you have to move rather quickly when you get busy to keep up for the day or it’s easy to fall behind fast
good,"I have been here this year in Aug. 4 yrs . I Believe that with all the hours that I put in and All that I have been showed and that I have returned in showing  them that I was worth what they Helped put into training me and I got No new raise ,When I was asked to be a Trainer after being returned to  this position  because of new floors in our establishments,was what we were told  . I was moved from the register back to the kitchen , Because I stepped up and filled a position that was vacant , due to a incident in our store and one of our kitchen staff having surgery . "
good,Caseys is a hard working job there's always something that needed to be done. So you were never just standing there doing anything and if you are just standing around it's because it's slow and you got everything done.
good,Very poor on appreciation and respect when it comes to employees working overtime and putting hard work. Store manager is very selfish and inconsideratell of their assistants.
good,Working at caseys was an ok job. While I worked there for only 7 months it was not the best time I had ever had. I have learned to never expect for the best in a job but to do what you are told and that is what caseys was promoting in my own opinion.
good,"This job is one that high schoolers shouldn't apply for, as it is too stressful on the body and mind. Responsibilities are far too many, as they often get pushed to be only one person's duty, which is unfair."
good,It was very busy most of the time especially during lunch hours. I repeatedly was working alone making pizzas. I became so overwhelmed with customers.
good,I worked here and was passed over for a management position for a reason that is discriminatory. My first manager was very nice but now that we got that new manager I am not sure how I really feel about the choices that Casey's has made.
good,The job had a lot of different opportunities. On the other hand the people and managers I worked witb did not know how to work with their employees very well. They also kept changing things between each other.
good,A normal day at Casey's was fairly easy through out the day we had a strong team as far as the employees. Work was energetic and Straight to the point
good,"This position was a clerk position in a convenience store and include waiting on customers, cleaning the store and working with management on special promotions."
good,already did filled in on last time asked. all caseys are pretty much the same some just have different ways of doing things
good,Store managers work long hours.  Company offers great benefits and overall company culture aspirations should make it a great place to work.
good,"Busy store, lots of traffic, on the highway.  Requires being quick on your feet and quick with your hands."
good,Running the cash register. Meeting interesting people. It was enjoyable.
good,"It was okay to work there."
good,The best part of this job was the customers. The worst part of this job was the drama from the younger group of people working there.
good,"I really enjoyed working here.  The location I worked for had a pretty hard time keeping good management, but other than that I really liked my job."
good,"Co-workers are ok"
good,This was a needed job but definitely not a place I wanted to stay in for too long.  The manager at the store I worked at was great but the District Manager was not as easy to work with.
good,"While it is a gas station/convivence store, they are more well known for their pizza, which is a major drawing card for their stores, and a considerable portion of their revenue."
good,"Although it is a very midwest chain, it still has a lot to offer by way of opportunity. Not the most glamorous job, but it pays some of the bills, most of the time."
good,"Crew members always make everyone feel welcomed! Great team memebers everywhere I traveled to help. Caseys General Stores are great work environments to expand skills such as customer service, stock maintenance, and food safety certificates."
good,Easy job to work and learn. Coworkers weren’t really good. I am a team member and like to help people out but no one would do the same if I needed help. Fun and fast work place !
good,Working here was okay. I worked here a little over a year. I made good friends and had so many “regular” customers that made work enjoyable. I went through 4 different managers in just a year. And I should have been paid more with all that I did. A lot of turn over. By the time I was done working here I was one of the longest working employees. I acted as manger and worked overtime a lot. My pay didn’t reflect that. They now beg me to come back and have offered me a manger position.
good,Working for Casey's has overall been a good experience for me but I would say they need to work on hiring better management at some locations in my area.
good,"Enjoyed working in the kitchen, putting up stock. At times it could be a little hectic but over all not bad. You could have some different kind of customeers."
good,"ask for help on weekends but did not get it manger needs to comunicate with the employes make sure that enery  ones that they are doing things right "
good,"Casey's was somewhat flexible with hours, but not always willing to work outside of them very often. It is a very busy place with no real time to take a break."
good,I loved working for Casey's. I just feel there wasn't enough authority. Management didn't really take their job seriously. There are rules and regulations but none really that were applied to our work/jobs.
good,"Don't know what to put here I worked all the time and hardly ever got days off, I loved my manager but the supervisor was in tolerable. They don't appreciate anything you do"
good,"It can be stressful, depending which store you wont get the hours you ask for or need if your at a small store. Sometimes day crew doesnt do their part in kitchen so night crew lotta times gets left with a long list of things to do which can get stressful, but other then that its a fun, fast paced, easy going job."
good,"I worked here for a few months and although I had to do 5 hours worth of work in 4 hours, it was still a fairly decent job. Great people and management."
good,"I found that I asked for a certain amount of hours but never received what I asked for. This job was supplemental income, but very necessary to take care of my family."
good,a nice place to work for a second job. the crew was fun to work with and a relaxed friendly environment. management can be a bit too relaxed about promising things but otherwise it was a good job.
good,"My typical day would be to greet customers when they came in, help if they needed something, and ring up their order. They work environment was good, enjoyed working with my fellow co-workers."
good,this is a job the requires cleaning up after grown adults as if they were toddlers.. dealing with complaining customers because your busy and cant get them through the line fast enough.. lets dont get started on the kitchen
good,A lot of people wouldnt show up for work and the manager wouldn't come in so we always had to stay for our shift plus another half a shift or a full extra shift. The people that wouldn't show up could do it all the time and we're never fired because we needed the help when they were able to come in.
good,"Going in at about 3 am to make the donuts , breakfast pizzas , sandwiches , then getting lunch ready . I've learned they only make 1 type of donut and the rest comes frozen . It's a very busy place to work . Managers are always near by in most cases . I enjoyed greeting / talking to customers every day"
good,loved the atmosphere of the job and the people I worked with were a blast. I loved the job but the hours and availability to switch out days were hard to do. I have children and working every weekend and nights gave me no time to spend with them.
good,"Time goes fast more things to do in a day then you can get done. For the most part work hard and you will be rewarded. Balancing home and work is almost impossible to do. The company continues to grow at a incredible rate,creating more jobs,advance opportunity. I learned that excellent customer service is the main ingredient to any company . Hardest part as a manager at Casey's is the stress due mostly to the large turn over of employees,but again that is to be expected in this type of job. Mostly people see this type of job a stepping stone not a career. I really enjoyed working for Casey's for many years . Most enjoyable part was the regular customers you get to know."
good,The most enjoyable part of the jobs was the customers. Working with co-workers was also enjoyable. The store is kept clean in the front end and the kitchen area.
good,I liked working for Casey's. The one thing I liked the most working at Casey's was that I was always busy never really had a slow down time. There is always something you can do there to keep yourself busy.
good,Caseys was an easy going fast paced job that paid the bills. Due to management I was let go for wrongfull accusations. Other than that easy job that doesn't take much training. while cooking on fast nights you need to be prepared and composed
good,The managers where there to socialize with the employees they liked while the others picked up the slack. Hours began to drop off and i finished my employment there.
good,"When i clock in to work, i first feel its important to greet everyone and they do the same. The work days can be very busy or kinda slow, depending on the the day of the week. When its busy its always important to stay on our toes. I'd say that is the hardest part of the job, the multitasking between constant customers from being busy and keeping the store looking presentable. Management could do a better job with scheduling, and making it easier for college students to balance studying and the work life. The coworkers is what made it most enjoyable. they make me want to come to work."
good,"Working the kitchen was a lot of fun, I enjoyed very much ,I was on my own most of time. the other employees were ok. some were nicer than others. The manager was very nice and treated all the employees decently."
good,"would come in and prep for day by making the dough, filling make table and start to make food. i would get done with prep work then orders would start to come in i would make and cut pizzas average of 15-35 a night. during time i'm not making orders i would i would be cleaning tables, ovens, floors, walls. i usually only had one other worker on my shift and she was busy running register  and doing her list of tasks for day. the hardest parts are on Fridays and Saturday Nights were orders would be close to 25+ pizzas in 2-3 hours"
good,"It was a wonderful job with friendly co-workers that were treated like one big family, the job itself was often fast paced and definitely required time management but it did have its slow moments. Regardless, there was always something to do and plenty of interesting interactions."
good,"Customer service"
good,Making pizzas for the customers.  Cleaning the kitchen area.  Running a cash register and assisting the customes.
good,"Fast paced job, dealing with all types of people. I learned how to make/prepare pizza for a commercial jobplace. My manager was great. Coworkers tended to be catty and unwilling to help one another. The hardest part of the job was trying to get everyone to work together in a postive manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was making pizza."
good,"Reported to work at 6am to start dailey bookkeeping,supervise employees, cash handling , inventories, over see any and all customer services. Stocked and cleaned shelves, sweep and mopped floors . The most valuable lesson I learned is to treat others the way you want to be treated. Any other way was unexceptable. Manager seen things a little different then I. Co-workers were good people. For the most part we worked as a team. I had no diffulculties with the physical part of the job but could have been trained more thoroughly with the paperwork in the beginning.  The most enjoyable part was working in the public."
good,You will work 9 hour shifts and you will get no breaks at all during these shifts.
good,This job was all about customer service I am a social person and I enjoyed coming to work. Working at a convience store is very demanded with the cleaning and serving the customers there is not alot of down time. I had come to enjoy the crew I worked with we had decent relationships even when I left. The hardest part of the job was the hours that you worked and only being part time there was no benefits. The best part about this job was being around people.
good,"I loved working at caseys, it was fun,i met alot of great people working there. Made alot of friends there. the hardest part of the job was when i had to leave due to moving out of state. My co-workers were amazing to work with,always ready and willing to lend a hand when needed."
good,"Signing in and counting the money safe and draw. Then you switch over and start serving customers. Do this for five or more hours then you either sign out and close down shop or you wait for the person coming in to do as you did when you arrived. I learned that customers are not always right, even if they think they are. My co-workers were older than me and were always gossiping about each other. It was terrible, much like being in high school again. The most enjoyable part of my job was clocking out."
good,A typical day at Casey's general store requires hard work and dedication. It is a very fast pace job you have to be able to multi task and you can lose track of time there is so much the is needed very demanding.
good,Great career opportunities if willing to put in the time. If you have the right manager to help you succeed in all your goals then it is well worth it. Miss working there and miss the customers.
good,"While I wasn’t ever particularly thrilled with my job, it was a fun environment where everyday was different. I didn’t care for management it the employees were fun to work with."
good,"A lot of hard work that was not recognized by management.   But I learned so many new areas of work, especially damage control with the gas pumps and helping people"
good,Casey's is the easiest job I've worked. It's very played back but can get very quick paced on certain days in the kitchen. I've been there for a year and haven't had any problems getting days off.
good,I loved my job there. I moved into management very quickly and got my own store at 1 1/2 years.I learned something new everyday. All of the wonderful i got to work with and customers   i became very close to.
good,I hated how little help we had and I loved the people I worked with.   But corporate controls too much.   Our pay sucked but the people were the best part
good,"Casey's is a company that is very good about hiring employees in and training them into upper management, but that's where advancement stops. It is very difficult to move into managing your own store or an area, even, and can be discouraging when you have the interest and motivation to move up in the company. The pay is also extremely low for the work required of some management, especially those working under lazy general management, and that pay tends to get cut during transfers."
good,"It was fun working there but the management was terrible. I liked seeing people I know all the time since it was the only gas station in Oxford. Working in the kitchen was much better than the cashier because I was nervous about messing up the change, plus people really liked how I made the hot foods."
good,Enjoyed the customers very much. I liked cleaning and making the store presentable for the customers. I got along well with the co workers. I would give a lending hand when needed
good,"A typical day at work included helping costumers with what they needed, cleaning the store, stocking the store and anything else that was asked of me."
good,"As a cashier, the best part of the job was the fast paced environment; helping people with their purchases in a quick manner.  As a sub-line sandwich maker, it was slow but fun because you can help the kitchen make pizza."
good,I enjoyed the people I met there. It was always a good day a work when you had nice co workers. There work with you if you need time off and are reasonable.
good,"The job itself was fun, but got a little stale sometimes, I had good co-workers, but some people that got hired didnt care as much about the job, the benefits are abysmal, but I didnt expect much being it was a gas station."
good,"I was constantly doing something, there was never really time for a break. When given the lunch break I was told it wasn't mandatory to give me one, although I stood all day long."
good,Management will work you like a dog if they like you and cut your hours down to nothing if they don't like you. Always a game of favorites. Other than that the work wasn't too difficult and coworkers are awesome.
good,"It is a really great place to work. Learn your job and do it the correct way, keep a good attitude, and show respect. You can go pretty far here just by doing that."
good,Management rules and requirements were not consistent. On different days the rules were different depending on their mood.  Overall it was a stable job.
good,Its an ok place nice people and fast paced at times. You also knew all your regular customers. Also your always doing everything your not just stuck doing one position.
good,It paid my bills but I needed and wanted more for my kids and my family. It was just a job at the time not a career for me. I left because of a medical emergency with my son.
good,"Working at Caseys was great to begin with. Then it just turned out to be not so great. In the middle of winter the over night staff were expected to go outside and wash down the gas pumps, wash the windows."
good,"Working front counter, cleaning, and talking with the customers. Working in the kitchen with the food and taking orders for food. I enjoyed the morning shifts and getting off work at a good time."
good,"It's decent. Good workers, good money, good hours, GREAT customers. It's not much to really say. Work is work, it's kinda what you make it. As long as you do your job and keep it professional there should be no problems other than the bad machinery."
good,"Fast paced, management could have been better. Satisfying and helping guest was the best part of the job. A typical work day was very busy time management is crucial and you have to be able to multitask at all costs."
good,Like manager.  Didn't like most Co wokers. Lack of employees made it hard to request time off.  To much goofing off from employees. Always running out of things due to lack of delivery on truck day. Impossible to be cross trained due to being short staffed.
good,"A typical day here would be to come in and make sure we had pizza dough for the night and the next day.  Answer phone orders and prepare pizzas the way the customers wanted them cooked.  Prepared warmer food as well.  Toward the end, I was running the register.  Stocked and cleaned the store when closing with the other night clerk."
good,"Good pay, good hours,poor management from District Manager on down.  If the higher ups like you you're in,  otherwise look out.  They make up things to put in your file so that you look bad.  Been there."
good,"Cashier, customer service, food prep, stock, inventory. "
good,"Fun atmosphere and fantastic coworkers, awesome customers who are patient and understanding, clean workspace, management is fun and joyful people to work with"
good,Great place to work. Understanding about changes in hours and life issues. Managers are willing to work with you and fellow employees were wonderful. Customers were very rude no matter how nice you are
good,A good place to re-enter the work force. It isn't very physically or mentally demanding and you can stay busy for the entire shift. Friendly environment and flexible shedule
good,"I have opened the store, and also closed the store for the day. I have taken inventory of everything I have submitted orders for the store each week. I have made up the deposits everyday and work on the work schedule if someone would call in sick. I have worked the cashier and also worked in the kitchen making anywhere from donuts to pizzas. I have learned what all it takes to make a store run everyday"
good,"I loved the people here. I worked between 60 to 80 hours per week. I never got recognized for the good things I did. However, the moment I messed something up or someone drove off without paying for their gas, the manager was right in my face yelling about how much paperwork she was going to have to do. In my opinion, If you don't like doing paperwork, don't be a manager. If you don't want people to drive off without paying for their gas, make everyone pre-pay. Also, when the manager had to cover someone's shift she was very unfriendly, towards customers and employees. Completely ignoring them at times."
good,not a bad place to work once you get there you log into the  register to clock in than if you're a cook you go into the kitchen and wait for pizza calls while making more ingredients and if youre really bored you can stock the coolers where the soda sits. and for the cashier you set the register into your name which requires a little financial counting from the previous cashier and than you number the scratch off cards as to prevent stealing and whatnot than you make sure coffee is fresh and serve customers
good,Casey's is a good place to work but as we all know if everyone doesn't work as a team ot makes it harder on the next but if you are trying to find something just to get by then this mayne the perfect job for them.
good,"-Friendliest customers that I've ever worked with."
good,The Casey's that I worked at was a very fast paced environment.  The day just flew by.  I began my day at 3:00 am in order to have all of the donuts in the case by 5:00 am.  I then made breakfast pizza's and sandwiches until about 10:30 when I switched to lunch food.  I also was responsible for cleaning pizza ovens and the doughnut fryer.  I helped put away deliveries on Friday mornings.
good,"co-workers are great, work around when you time off, only downfall they need more communication. if needing more hours just have to ask for them. manager is very outgoing and fun to work for."
good,"A typical day at Casey's would be making pizza's, donuts, coffee, and having a good time cooking.  The hardest thing about the job would to always make sure all the orders are right before I would send them out.  I enjoyed the customers; seeing my fellow coworkers, and just doing what I love to do.  I learned how to toss dough, and make donuts.  It was a good job, but just wish they paid more."
good,I liked working for this company but I was not getting enough hours working here. I didn't really like the management to much they picked favorites.
good,Started the day with doing the books and making sure all cash is balanced and counted for then get drawers ready with cash. Then started the coffee and getting machine up and running. As one is doing this there is someone who makes the doughnuts to be ready to go with pizza and breakfast sandwiches to be ready when doors open at 5 am. We then take care of the customers needs at there request. When no customers we clean stock and face the shelves. We make fresh food every hour at customer reach we also take individual orders. At close drawers where counted and placed in the safe.
good,Hired as part time but was made to work full time without same benefits. No scheduled breaks.
good,Always a fun fast paced environment.Great place to work if you dont mind limited hours.
good,Great place to start out for work to learn the basics of customer service. I work overnights and made donuts so there was room for a lot of hours.
good,I loved working for Caseys and would go back if I had a chance to. The best part is working with and around so many different cultures.
good,"working here you will be all over the place i loved it "
good,"most enjoyable was regular customers and co workers,least enjoyable was never having a life allways getting called "
good,"donut speedway!!!frosting and glazing a bunch of donuts and cooking a bunch of breakfast pizza biscuts n gravy, and 4 different kinds of breakfast sandwiches. have to be watching time the whole shift because breakfast shift has so much to do you have to really get into your own routine, to get everything out on time but its really fun once your in ur own groove"
good,"id sign in and count all the money in safe and register, Make coffee then sweep and mop then update all systems.I learned all about running cash registers and updating systems..management was good but i never really interacted with them because i worked 3rd shift..my coworkers were nice and everyone got along real good.hardest part of my job was doing the floors and the most enjoyable was meeting all the people that came into the store"
good,The company does have a lot of room for advancement. For the most part the district and area managers are good people who are willing to teach you what you need to know.
good,"typical day is prepping dough and veggies for pizzas, receiving orders and preparing the food. Stocking coolers and Ice chest. Keeping all work areas clean and sanitized.cleaning floors and restrooms, maintaining grounds,( ie sweeping, washing windows, etc)."
good,Wish I stills worked there as a cashier I did not enjoy woring in the bakery
good,Not enough pay for work required. I was not given enough hours and was mislead about advancement. My manager had a felony but fired others over felonies.
good,If you need a some what easy job where customers are 1st this is the job for you. Over time in the summer if you need it winter time is another story. Hours will be cut. If you work part time days off asked you get them full time  days off very.
good,Love working in the kitchen and meeting new people every day. Its always clean and always stocked. For the most part everyone that works there is nice to each other but sometimes the work balance is mor 80/20 with people
good,Casey’s was a good place to work.  It’s slow for advancement. The store management has ideas of how things should be done but are reluctant to new ideas to streamline their processes across the board
good,Working here can be fun at times but also stressful especially when its rush time and people start complaining.  Wanting food. Wanting to be rung up. Making food is fun. But not sure if I still want to do it.
good,"Not a bad place to work, overall. "
good,"The workplace culture is stressful. The pay is decent, fast-paced environment. Management is helpful, the cashiers are friendly, the most enjoyable part of this job is the customers."
good,to much drama with management and other workers lots of gossip things have changed with management raises at getting really bad I've worked with them for 9 years and I need a change
good,"although the managers have been sub par, the staff is great with much to do and customers quite friendly. even on a long day or a double shift the pace makes it go by quick"
good,A good place to work that was flexible with my hours and let me transfer when I moved after only 3 months of working there. Managment was very accommodating and helpful to make things work.
good,"working with the other employees was nice. they worked around my schedule for me, but the management was not to good. they poorly maintained the work environment."
good,It was a good first job to get me off and started with my life. Looking forward to what I get next.  Only thing I could say is work on there employee skills with there employees.
good,Fast paced friendly and flexible. Career potential. Great for majority age ranges. Plenty of different positions to c what is more comfortable personally
good,"Ive worked at two Casey's, I say the neoga store has the mattoon store beat.  To much gossip talk it sseems like and mainly  from the Managers.  The ones that run the stores dont seem to care since they get paid the same weekly and us emplpyee have to bust butt"
good,I liked working for Casey's but there is people who don't want to pull their own wait. I had weeks where I worked a lot of hours then the next week I'd only work maybe 27 hours.
good,If you go in with an open mind and love the people you are there to work for (customers) and you keep your head out of the clouds you can go far. Also could use consistant promotions and training to slow turn around effects.
good,They tell me one thing but turn around and do another. Been told they don't hire people in relationships but then let a couple join. You work alone for the most part.
good,"I enjoyed working there. I had a few mistakes as most people do, but the job was mot very difficult to accomplish. The management is a little faulty. The hardest part was hoestly getting everything on the checklist done before shift ending time."
good,"Overall great people, alright times. Difficult customers as always. Learned a lot, met a lot of nice co-workers whom I am still in contact with as friends."
good,"Nice area, great location! Whenever there is something going on in town, you get an onslaught of customers.  Every now and again, you meet folks from out of town / country too, which is nice. "
good,"I liked working there and gained many new skills as a first time job. I relocated with my family is why I left. The people, atmosphere and pizza were great."
good,"Fun work environment, just bad management. Would have definitely stayed , if it wasn't for the manager being rude, stuck up n just straight up disrespectful "
good,I love my co-workers and you get to know the regulars. Management is lacking and there seems to be a big turn over rate. It can feel like the crew is family sometimes but it really depends on management.
good,Overall laid back place. Just needs higher pay. Also they need more workers who are open to work both cashier and cook anytime if the day or at night time
good,"It's a great place to work, if you like long hours and poor management. I've worked there for about two years. I have been given management duties, while am not the manger. There is a lot of talk  about who does what and who doesn't do their job. How this person does this but this person gets away with it, Double standers  Its OK with one but not the other. It's a bunch of drama and not worth the pay for the work load."
good,"Making pizzas for customers, answering phone calls for orders, making additional prep for kitchen use.Learned to toss pizza dough easily, make donuts."
good,The toughest part was having to keep up with cars at the pumps even when you had a line of customers. A typical day was pretty relaxed. Customers are nice and make the day go by smoothly. My manager was a very nice and patient manager.
good,Wonderful manager at the time assistant manager was the issue.can be stressful definitely need to be able to balance personal life with work life. Usually always need to be on call
good,"Simple job, made pizzas, you wouldn’t believe how busy Casey’s can get though at times, it sure got busy but at times it did die down and become rather boring. Decent balance."
good,Casey's is a very welcoming and open environment. We will always greet you with a smile and ask you if there is any way we can help. So come on in to Casey's.
good,"Interesting place to work. Co-workers were helpful and management didn't hover. Rather, they entrusted their workers to do their job instead of micromanage."
good,"No one day is ever the same!  I love most of my customers.  Hiring and keeping good help is the hardest part of this job.  It is very fast paced, always changing job."
good,I enjoyed working with the regular customers. I got to know what products they liked and I would have them ready when they walked in. I enjoy helping others.
good,"I have had a lot of different responsibilities at Casey's, such as a food service leader, cleaning, stocking and also being part of inventory. I've taken good care of the customers. Things may have gotten very busy time to time, but nothing that I couldn't handle. I don't let pressure come to me. I enjoyed my job a lot because I got to meet new people and become friends with customers. I learned a lot of new things everyday. I continue to try to learn new things on a day to day bases."
good,This was great place to work had I been working under a different management team. The corporation itself is fantastic to work for.  I would definitely recommend anyone to seek employment there.
good,I don't know what really to write on this space so I am going to try to just fill it up so I can move on to the next question. It was an ok place to work.
good,"The managers and staff were really helpful when training new employees on what they needed to do. Staff made the job fun, which made the time fly by. Loved all the customers."
good,"I enjoyed working here. Love working with the regular customers that come in daily in this small town. Management was very difficult to deal with. Store manager and assistant were always expected to do the hiring and if upper management didn’t approve such hires, that was a lot of extra hours put on us store managers."
good,They were a great company to work for. Management could use a little work. They are very family oriented. The growth of new store locations steadily inclined every year of my employment.
good,"After getting robbed at gun point and assured Caseys management would be contacting me for consueling, which never happened and then  left to fien and learn for myself as a new first time store manager meanwhile getting write ups for policies and rules Ive never heard or knew anything about. Then getting fired for doing my best, working over 60-70 + hours a week, broken promises to get me trained correctly, and treated so unfair, being called a liar, yes with a couple tardy problems i had. I would love to work for Caseys again however never work under the same  management team I had."
good,It was very fast paced. The typical day would go longer than expected because the kitchen closed at 11 and typically would need more than an hour to clean up the kitchen. The downside was only 1 person always closed the kitchen.
good,overall it was okay to work for caseys however hiring process is a bit over the top and seniority doesn't matter at all its like pulling teeth to get management to work with you and to listen
good,"I worked at Casey's for a short amount of time. I was treated fairly, paid accordingly for the size of the town, company, and my job, and was given adequete breaks."
good,I enjoyed working for this company because they are understanding of family and employee needs. Management did their best to be fair and reward hard work.
good,Good job overall. But their areas which I believe need to be looked at. Need to be fair with all employees no matter what. Their shouldn't be favoritism at no job!
good,I loved my job there I just was working way to muh and wanted more time with my family. I loved my manager he was great but the general manager could've been there more to help out when I was the only manager running a there manager store.
good,"The company itself was a good cpmpany to work for, but if you can't handle people not for you. You hire your own employees so it truly is what you make of it. Great bonus program, good hourly wage and salary. Can be overwhelming but very rewarding with a good foundation."
good,The job in total was fast paced and the requirement for breaks during the long shifts was not observed by the company as a whole. I was required to perform many duties as the assistant manager that I was not paid for.
good,Ok job..not very good pay/benefits...fun work environment....lots to do/learn....loved muy mgs manager she was very helpful and polite....she enjoyed working with the employees
good,The work place and employees were very easy going and easy to get along with. Fast paced environment with many different and simple tasks to perform. Managerial staff was not the best.
good,"Typical gas station, not too physically demanding. Learned quite a bit about what it takes to be in management, how to handle employees and disagreements between said employees. I learned how to interview potential employees and what to look for in a good candidate. Learned more about the Casey's corporation. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the inner workings and the budgets included in running a store."
good,"Some of the rules in place don't make much sense, but otherwise it's an overall pleasant work environment. Hours are okay and coworkers are pleasant and fun to work with."
good,"I enjoyed working for Casey's.  My boss was very understanding and worked well with me when it came to schedule changes.  The work was easy and had opportunities to move up in management. "
good,"Casey's would be a good job for a high school student or a college student. The pay could be a little better, and so could the benefits. I liked the job there just did not pay enough."
good,"I really enjoyed working there, but our manager constantly reminded us that we were all replaceable and made sure to point out everything we did wrong. I loved the people and customers that I had."
good,"Good experience here since you work both with customer service and in the kitchen. There is room for improvement with management, particularly keeping to employee's needs with work schedules and ensuring employees do as is required of them."
good,Everyone there was nice and treated me with respect. The managers are understanding and are cool about playing on or listening to your phone on a slow night until a customer shows up. If it was a long and busy day and you need help the managers will step in to assist you to make it easier on you. They do their job and respect their workers.
good,"General manager is very young. He can be a rude gentleman, very high turn over rate due to drama, too many young employees. I worked the night hours and they are kind of sucky"
good,"Typical Day starts with shift change, and then regular register procedures."
good,"Opening and closing the store, daily books, ordering, checking in vendors.  Writing the work schedule for other employees. Making the daily bank deposits."
good,The company itself is a good employer.  My personal location needs a review in their management people in fairness and conduct.  Under values the employees.
good,"Lots of cleaning and cooking, you're in the kitchen making pizza, making sandwiches for the cooler, preparing vegetables for pizza and next shift. If you are not in the kitchen you are helping a customer at the register or stocking up the drinks in the cooler. Make sure your area is clean and orderly."
good,"My duties included preparing food, running the register, training other employees, stocking and rotating product, and providing excellent customer service. I mostly worked the night shift and made food for the to go orders. I learned how to think on my feet and how to deal with customers. The management is above average for a small town. The hardest and most enjoyable part of my job is making food and helping customers at our busy hours."
good,"I did kitchen work and helped others with his or her job. It was a good job while I worked there. Then were even excited to have me back. I only had part time work, they weren't enthusiastic about hiring me on full time."
good,"It was an ok job. Nice to be around common customers and the work load was worth the pay. I enjoyed the position. however, I was not able to maintain the position due to personal reasons."
good,It was a wonderful place to work in a fast paced environment . They promoted goal seeking and always kept you busy . The breaks were very short .
good,A lot of jobs to have to do in one day alone the part that stinks is you don't get breaks unless you're a smoker and you always have to be moving whether or not you finished your jobs
good,I continue to enjoy my position at Casey's. My coworkers are generally hard working and willing to help others when needed. As a part of the management team I have a great deal of responsibility and am willing to assist others when and where I can.
good,"I did all register closing duties at the register. Waited on customers at the register, Handle money Transactions."
good,"Cook food all day, constantly clean, stock cooler, bag ice, answer phone and take customers orders, keep the warmers stocked full of food at all time, and deal with customers."
good,Casey's is a convenient place to work and love interacting with people. Dont feel like there is a lot of room to advance here and would like an oppurtunity to.
good,"Easy place to work, Not to easy with working with your hours. "
good,see previous review for this employer and details about it and the opinion of others who agree
good,same views and opinions as my other review for this employer
good,"This was not my favorite job, but I did find certain parts of it enjoyable"
good,I enjoyed working in the kitchen making foods. Cashiering was nice cause i enjoy dealing with the public. some of the people i worked with wer not so friendly.
good,It was a good stepping stone into the work life. It enabled to understand what was going to be like to earn a living
good,Casey's is a great place to work if one is looking to supplement their income while attending school or if one has an interest in the gas station/ customer service industry.
good,"A lot to learn but fun. Always something to do or clean. Weather being stocking,cleaning or helping customers. There is always something to do. Also making sandwiches."
good,"the  people  there  were  nice,  some  of  the  managers  at  the  time kinda "
good,"i came into this job without any real previous experiance ,i was able to learn quickly due to the presence of a very helpful group of coworkers. i was very pleased with everything."
good,"This was a part-time job. I worked as a cashier and  pizza maker. I only worked here for a short time, while I was between jobs. This is a great company and they care about their customers and employees."
good,"Of all the places I had applied to, this one called me back. "
good,"Great opportunities. Really respectful. Good management. Great customer service. Training is pretty quick as long as u stay on task, and learn what you need to. Everything is in a recipe form which makes making orders faster and easier."
good,"The day to day was enjoyable, Lots of miscommunication and short staffing. management was not proving and understanding its employees. Working more than needed because lack of communication."
good,Being employed by Casey's is both great and somewhat annoying Casey's says they are about being a team but they would hire anyone they seem to always be low staffed someone is always doing more than anyone else picking up other people's slack the good employees rarely get noticed
good,"Typical day: make food, clean dishes, ring up customers, clean up store"
good,"Great staff, with great customers. You learn alot from the small town from the customers just as much from the actual employors. Happy greet at the door."
good,"When I worked there management wasn’t all that great. I mostly taught learned everything myself, the managers would just tell you what to do rather than show you."
good,"Although Casey's General Store is a very convenient job with significant pay,  there is a lack of professionalism within the management. There has been times where my upper management has ""lost"" important notes or letters that benefit me. Also, there are countless health code violations that managers tend to ignore. The company itself is not impaired, but speaking locally there are management issues that only favor male employers. For the amount of financial compensation, the work environment at hand is somewhat bearable."
good,Fun and easy work environment. Management was a real plus. Other employees were easy going and fun to work with. Customers were for the most part easy going as well.
good,"The coworkers are great, good management, and good food. I wouldn’t say there was really anything bad that happened while I was employed there that I can think of."
good,Good work good coworkers lots of cleaning help in kitchen plenty of opportunities at the company and if you work had enofe you can move up to management
good,It is a convenience store. Really nothing is hard to do and the base pay is pretty solid. However the worst part of this job will be the people you may have to deal with. Over all not bad.
good,"At the time I was hired, the GM was just hired as well. So we were both going through training at the same time. I actually really enjoyed my position on the subline, that is, when I got to work it. Midnights were madness, and with a brand new gm, things were a little crazy. Tensions were high, and more seasoned employees were exhausted."
good,"The most difficult part was poor management and poor supervisors. When the supervisors are rude and push your managers to quit, you’re left with a staff that is expected to do the managers’ duties. Otherwise fine."
good,People were nice very fun to work there i met alot of different people but it was interesting and fun ..................................................
good,"Not a bad place to work, though it doesn't have enough room for advancement and there aren't enough consistent hours so the schedule tends to be wonky and i prefer a set consistent schedule."
good,Working at Casey’s for me was actually really great up until I had a lot of medical issues that they quickly became aggravated about. I’d get sick frequently and the manager stopped being understanding after the third time I got sick on the job. Finally ended up having to quit due to ending up in the hospital and their response to it.
good,"A typical day really depended on what shift you worked. Mornings and afternoons were usually busy since we were one of the first places people stopped before going to work or for lunch. I learned a lot about customer care here. Management was always nice and tried to be as accommodating as possible. It was a pretty laid back place to work. The hardest part of the job was not screwing up lotto tickets (not scratch offs, megamillions and whatnot) because not only did it really upset people but there was a whole big process to cancel a ticket. The part I enjoyed most was the discounted food and drinks and getting to know the regular customers. I still remember some of them vividly!"
good,this establishment is a super fast paced place to work. very competitive with other stores with raising money and such for st judes etc. this is a very coorperate business.
good,Good company to work for but hours are not predictable. Good company to start with cashiering and stocking shelves. no benefits and part time work. overall ok
good,Casey’s is a nice store to work out to start out as a working career to move up in the world. Really nice people but you had some rude ones as well and I feel less drama should be around.
good,Working at Casey's was the first job I had working in a kitchen and I honestly liked it they had me cooking cleaning and stocking but the pay wasn't great it was fair for how easy the work was but it wasn't great
good,"Would highly recommend for college students, anyone looking for high paced, and sometimes physically challenging.  It is imperative to have good customer relations skills."
good,"Great place too work for, easy work, nice atmosphere to work in, only reason for leaving was due too another job coming up with better chances of advancement/pay"
good,Depending on what store you work at you might see a bit of a revolving door situation. Customers can be your favorite people or your worst nightmare..
good,It was a great place to work until they brought in a new kitchen manager that personally I'm not happy about to many new changes a ton of work and a ton of paper work to get done in an extremely short limited time most of the time by yourself
good,"They trained me very well there, to start. They worked with me when I had health problems going on. They listened to whatever I had to say about anything involving the job. They were very kind."
good,"I actually like working here. There isn't a lot of down time so I'm always doing something, and the people I work with are nice and helpful. The store is clean and the responsibilities are easy to learn."
good,"Good work flow, hours weren't the best but not bad. Management was good, they helped out if needed. Rarely were out of anything. Not a competitiveenvironment."
good,It was fun place to work at just had bad manager there she ended up lieing about the hours she worked and stole money from the company other than that it was a fast-paced kitchen cooking about a hundred pizzas a day
good,It was a good employee to work through. I recommend other to work here . Great learning experience. Customer service skills . Hopefully I can work for this company again someday
good,Like the employees like customer like the store hours air free drinks cooler was cold but not to bad made pizza free coffee drinks slushy any drink you want
good,A typical day at work was busy and fast paced depending on how many cashiers were working. The manager was very rude and could be quite unprofessional by yelling at people in the parking lot in front of customers. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with all the little daily duties while I was the only one on the register. The people that I worked with were nice most of the time and my favorite part of working there was the regular customers that came in almost every day.
good,"I started in the fall, which was the end of their summer hours. At christmas time I was informed they would be cutting everyone's hours. I was cut to 8 hours a week and they weren't on the same day."
good,"Friendly employees, flexible hours. Understaffed with only minimum wage unless management. High turnover rate. Management does work with personal issues if time off is needed"
good,It was a learning experience but I had to relocate. Everything was fast paced and we were constantly making food every hour. It was simple after you got the hang of it.
good,Fun place to work. Employees worked as a team.  The hardest part of the job were the cleaning requirements that had to be done every shift while working alone.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers that came in.
good,"Honestly, I started less than 4 months after store was built in Bainbridge, IN. I worked there for over a year and 2 months it truly wasn't a bad experience at all. It was probably one of my favorite jobs to date."
good,Caseys had people who didnt do their job right which made everyone else have to pick up their slack. Management wouldn't do corrective action. Management didnt know how to approach coworkers and co workers had issues listening to some managenent
good,"Relaxed work environment means the work doesn't come home with you. As this is a still a ""small town"" business the pay isn't the best but it works great for a flexible schedule. Short shifts mean they don't have to worry about giving employees breaks but that also means your working day might be just a 4-5 hour shift. This is a job that requires self-discipline to get your work done because management expects you to complete your list of tasks before leaving work without them having to see it thru. I would recommend friends/family to work here.......Family friendly, low stress, flexible hours."
good,I would work either nights or mornings. Every weekend I open the store and complete books. At night I would either work in the kitchen or on the register. The hardest part was the flexibility of hours.
good,"My co-workers was great the customers was great the job overall was great but my manager seemed to be over his head, not finding a balance between customers happiness and workers morale. Siding with the customers to the point that some customers would abuse it just because the didn't like you."
good,"A typical day at Casey's can go from bad to good in minutes they are short staffed a lot, so if someone calls in they have to scramble to get someone to stay longer or to call someone to cover a shift. I was in the process of becoming the 2nd asst so I was learning how to do the books. I have worked at 3 different Casey's and they were all different in they're own way. It was easy to interact with everyone. I think that the hardest part of my job would either been doing other people's work if they did do it or dealing with the customer's that were rude all the time, and the most enjoyable part of my job was learning new thing's and getting to meet many new people"
good,"All jobs have ups and downs.  Nothing is hard about customer service.  I enjoy waiting on the customers, they get to be like family."
good,"As far as corporations, fairly nice to work for.  Added bonus of incorporating my job skill list, I've worked at two locations; the other in Kennett, MO."
good,Life the company values. Wish district managers knew them as well as store managers. This company loves to guide our nation's finest veterans and supports family values
good,"Worked as a full time cashier. Learned how to run the store efficiently and effectively. Provided excellent customer service, and learned the regular customers well."
good,"A typical day at work for me went like this: as soon as I walked in the door I got ready first then clocked in and got to work and worked hard the whole night through up until I clocked out. The workplace environment is easy to adapt to, some of the co-workers weren't as cooperative or put in much effort but me and the other few good workers did enough to pick up the slack, sadly this was a regular basis and unfair."
good,I worked there during High School. had poor management and negative coworkers. the best part of working there was free pizza and leaving the building to deliver pizza.
good,Wonderful place to work. Unfortunately the management at the particular Casey's i wrked for was HORRIBLE! The relationship with the customer was what i cherished.
good,I liked this job but could not make ends meet with hours and pay i was making. If I had been able to receive hire pay and get more hours I would have stayed.
good,a constantly moving job. friendly employees. very warm atmosphere. BARS Program does random checks. I learned how to make great pizza there and it was an overall great place to work
good,I liked working at this store. The manager tried to fit my schedule with my kids but I wasn't able to find the correct babysitting for the evening part of my shift. Fun environment to work in.
good,I’ve worked there for two years. I loved the customers not so much the job. I also serve In the military so every month they would find it a hassle to accommodate my hours to somone else and I felt victimized because of it.
good,Pay isn’t the best but good for the job and work place is fun. Good for high school or college for easier part time work. Benefits are worth it if you sign up.
good,"Casey's is fast paced, no set schedules, all different shifts, differemt positions to choose from and mainly more so for young people who can afford to work at the pay they offer."
good,"The biggest problem with my current store is that it can't seem to keep it's employees for more than a month before they stop showing up. Which in turn just makes everything so much more complicated and creates an atmosphere of stress for the people who have and will stick with casey's and the people who have stayed have not been rewarded in any way, not even a thank you."
good,The managers were nice and helpful when needing to ask question about a task. The store was always kept clean for the customers. There was always someone available to help when a customer needed it.
good,I really liked the work and co workers. Enjoyable place to work. Liked my customers and enjoyed what I done there. I was provided a key to the store so I was able to open and close when called for.
good,"Caseys is a good place to work, i like the company, it just varies store to store based on what is available, and the management. As a delivery driver, i like being able to be in the store making orders and working with customers, but the ability to leave on deliveries and be outside."
good,I make a lot of pizzas it makes you feel accomplished and laid back environment. The boss doesn’t breathe down your back so you feel like you’re in charge with a sense of responsibility
good,"I usually make pizzas and when needed help on register I will help. Usually the job is pretty easy and ok, but some people donot do their jobs to their best abilitiy and so it makes it harder on others."
good,"It isn't a bad job, I wouldn't want to make a living out of it but it pays good for what it is and works great for a college student. I also like how they allow smoke breaks and aren't strict about eating during work."
good,"on a daily bases you stand at the counter greet guests and stock the fridge. the thing I learned was customer service "
good,Enjoyable job. Good people and good management. Fun environment. They were Always good to me and I would recommend it to anyone. The hours are good and flexible.
good,Fast paced day - early hours - learned customer service - management good - workplace culture - stressful - hardest part - too fast paced; most enjoyable - the people.
good,it is a great place to work every one had they own duties that had to be done befor getting off the clock working at casey is all abt team work which is great
good,"I was full time I only worked pizza never ran register at my request and I was granted my request. I would make pizza and sandwiches for the warmer. People would call in and order pizza. At night you to do dishes tear down ovens and clean them. Make dough if needed. Stock the store cooler, the ice machine and help with the fronts duties. Working with the public was my favorite cuz you meet all kinds of people."
good,Good job good pay. Need to provide health care benefits to part time employees. Job can get repetitive and not all coworkers are team players. Good starting job
good,"Decent place to work, however if you have a lot of bills to pay, not really enough money to pay for them if you only work part time. Management is good"
good,The two cases in Forest City they're great bosses need a little stiffer back bone but awesome people who work for always willing to help out or give a hand Lake Mills Caseys is Non-Stop bickering childish Acts and the manager there pics favorites
good,"I enjoyed working there. It was fast pace, had things to do never a down moment. Always found something to keep yourself busy. It was a friendly place to work."
good,The environment is extremely fun and productive. Management is really good! The company doesn't offer full time positions often and benefits are very minimal.
good,Casey's is a fast paced job. Customer servers is important to Casey's. They usually treat their employees well. Some problems aren't addressed as soon as they should be but overall they are a good company to work for.
good,"A typical day in the workplace consists of answering the phone, making pizza/sandwiches, and keeping the store clean for the next shift"
good,I personally liked working for this company for the most part. Most of the employees whom I worked with were kind and open. Customer service type work always seems to work best for me. I was sadly let go due to a mistake and do not blame the company in any way.
good,i enjoyed working at casey's because of the customers were most of the time pretty awesome and easy to serve. i enjoyed making different foods for people to their specifications.
good,This store was very clicky. If you weren't in with them then they will cut your hours and look for reason to get rid of you.was really good at first everyone was nice but then it all changed.
good,crew members were awesome. some if the management could have been more recptive to ideas. some of them seemed like they were power hungry or power crazy.
good,The Corporate structure doesn't take the time needed to train managers on anything but paperwork. They do not prepare them for common place issues such as conflict management or interviewing skills. As a result most of the managers don't have the skills or resources they need to help their stores succeed. Casey's store level employees have a very high turn over rate and I believe it's because of the lack of training they give their teams.
good,Job was not bad left because of poo management co workers are awsome and loved the customers as well pay could also be a little better but other than poor management enjoyed job
good,"I was happy with my coworkers at casey's and the management followed my availability, but when I tried to transfer, they didn't complete their end of the transfer, causing me to lose my job."
good,"wait on customer, keep your work area cleaned and faced. Keep stock fresh. Sometimes you will have to help in the kitchen or with putting truck away. Pretty easy laid back job for extra spending money"
good,The job at Caseys was ok.  I was only working there while I went to school.  I do not think that it would make a good long term job but for something just to get you by it is alright.
good,It can be a very fast paced environment with some down time. You get to interact with a variety of people and need to have strong people/communication skils
good,Decent job and pays decently. Pretty good about working with your schedule and they do a good job of keeping a good work atmosphere  most of the time .
good,"Worked for two different Casey's store, both ran the same way. Pay was fair for the job that you do, management seemed to have a lot on their plate with little payment"
good,I enjoyed working there. Customers make job fun. Would still be there but decided to do home health care. Loved the customers you definitely get attached to them
good,i loved the people (customers) im very much a people person. that made the job much more desirable. my manager on the other hand was not very good also wasnt there very long after i left
good,Caseys is a nice place to work but management was non helpful and I lacked hours. Many other coworkers left through the time I was there due to same issues.
good,"My experience at Casey's was not bad. It can be challenging sometimes when some customers are rude, but then there are other customers that make your day brighter. I say that it is a nice job to get some experience with working with different people."
good,"Being a Store Manager I needed to know how to do everything in the store.  I was a very fair manager and people were sad to see me go.  I trained, terminated, did book work, everything so that I could teach others how to do it also."
good,"Manager was excellent, some small town drama with co-workers but overall congenial. They were understanding and worked with me and my medical limitations."
good,"It was great to work here, until they hired a light duty supervisor.  She had no experience and she was young, so she had to take care of her friends who worked there"
good,I loved working for Casey's! It is a very friendly company and an amazing job to have. I enjoyed interacting with the customers throughout my shifts the most.
good,"I had a good time working with caseys, I wouldnt have left if i haddnt been in a negative spot in my life, the job is worth it if it starts at the same wage"
good,"If you need a first job, or maybe bidding your time till retirement, then this is a fine job for you. the benefits and pay could seriously become improved but not a bad business overall. They will call you in the middle of the night to cover someone else's shift but they will take no for an answer."
good,Its a nice company to work for with friendly staff and opportunity for advancement. In the time that I've worked there I have never had any issues getting time off when I needed it.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of making coffee for customers as well as taking out the trash, cleaning the bathrooms, working at the cash register doing daily transactions and making sure the work area and store was clean and organized. I learned a lot of responsibility as well as face to face interaction and communicating with the public. The workplace culture was very diverse since it was a gas station and the environment was constantly changing. The hardest part of the job was having to work sometimes by myself when it was busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet new people and also working in an ever-changing environment."
good,The customers made my day. Pleasing them and starting their day out good is worth it. Caseys pizza is very good. The friendly feeling you got when you walked in there was good.
good,"I started out as a part time employee working 20 hours a week, it took me 7 years and a lot of hard work and determination to move up. I really enjoy my customers and being able to be up and moving around."
good,fun workplace with great coworkers and a awesome general manager. the hours were there for part time but the pay was not worth the effort. but like I said it was fun. mind you this was ten years ago.
good,It was alright there.  No benefits or job advancements that I could see in the future and it was a little disheartening to have worked so well and good but not get praised for it.
good,"I liked working at Caseys, was a stressful job for me, but over all was a great place to work. Meeting the people was my favorite.  Is like working for a huge family."
good,"i liked everything about this job, i stayed employed there for almost a year till i relocated to Colorado. everyone that was apart of the staff were easy to get along with."
good,"Can be fun at times but a lot of hard work. Coworkers were sometimes fun to work with. They watch their associates like a hawk and you work your butt off for minimum wage pay. Corporate people do not care about their associates, they are just a number. The work is mostly typical of any convenience store."
good,"The general environment is good. Most of the people are nice, Most of the customers are nice. As with all places, there have been issues, but nothing to bad."
good,I learned quite a few managerial skills. I learned how to balance doing multiple things at once. We were more like family than coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job was my regular customers.
good,"Very clean and safe environment to work in. Can be a fun and enjoyable job. Working your way up in the company is recommended if you enjoy the job. Overall a good job, not really looking for a career here though."
good,"They were very understanding with the medical issues my son was having and understood that I had to stay in the hospital with him, and that is something hard to find in a work place"
good,"As the store manager I was in charge of 12-18 employees.  I worked all shifts and all days of the week.  I was in charge of daily bookkeeping, ordering, stocking, covering shifts if needed.  I also did all the hiring and firing of employees.  I learned that everyone is different and has to be  treated and communicated with differently than the next person.  The hardest part of the job was missing out on family and home time.  One of the positive upsides though was quarterly bonuses.  When they were good it was great because it showed how well my hard work paid off."
good,the people are friendly and the working environment is great. They are willing to work with anyone. Hardest part is when you get slammed with a bunch of pizza orders at once
good,The job itself was fun and was not hard to do. If I had anything negative it would be that the manager's attitude really does effect morale. This can cause the job to be a bit difficult at times. The company is great though.
good,I Loved Working There I Just Needed More Hours. I love working with the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers and making sure their needs are taken care of.
good,"As with any company, one location can be better than another location depending on management. One manager can do great with people and then other managers can and will run them in the ground. It can be a great company to work for as long as you are 18 or older due to alcohol sales rules. "
good,I loved working here. I enjoyed being in charge of all things in the kitchen. All of my coworkers were very fun to work with.
good,"Casey's was a good job! I liked working there very much. Clean and organized work environment with friendly people. It would have been nice if management would have been more involved, but overall it was  a great place of employment."
good,its's a ok job i dont mind working here it lets me provide for my wife and such i go in do my job and go home...................................
good,"I would go there and get the apron and hat on and go in and check the list on what needs to be done for the day along with taking orders from customers. "
good,"The Casey's that I worked at was not all that organized with how they managed different things, they would also blame other people for their mistakes. The majority of the people I worked with were very nice. My typical day was unloading the truck, when it was my day, cleaning, making food, and helping customers."
good,I absolutely loved working at Caseys the employees and customers were like family. We looked forward to everyone seeing each other I miss it
good,"Mostly everyone in the store is smiling, and will greet you but some do not smile or anything when you walk in.  Sometimes they'll be chit chatting with customers.  Don't get me wrong because I know some employees work their butts off.  It's not the fastest gas station i've been to, but it works well for a small town."
good,Caseys general store was a store with constant commotion. The store was always busy. the coworkers were not always the friendliest.
good,I enjoyed working here i just didnt enjoy the hours but as a part time job i wasnt going to complain... id work here again if i had to
good,"On a typical day at work I would try to go out of my way to assist each customers by making sure if they found what they came for. If not I would go out of my way to see, to locate the item for them. If I'm unable to locate the item due to being out of stock. I would take their contact information or I would share with them what days we get our trucks in to have them call in to make sure we have that item in before making the trip in. What I have learned is that you need be productive when working, and make sure customers that come and go are happy because they are whom you see each day. You want those customers to come back. What I have learned in Management is you have to build a relationship with the employees, so you that you and the employees can work as a team. "
good,Whenever I worked at the bar it was always a good day at work good vibes and good people! I've learned you never know what could happen whenever it gets packed inside the bar and an argument starts. I loved being manager it brought alot more pay plus i made wonderful tips because i was the manager so that ment that i was the main bartender. My coworkers became my friends there was only 2 other employees they was always upbeat and happy. The hardest part of the job is you get just as many rude people as you do complements and it was hard whenever i'd have to make a customer leave for a night because he had had too much liquor and couldnt handle it anymore! The most enjoyable part of my job was making the friends i've made...and meeting new people and experiencing new things about people how different people are!
good,unset schedule with constant people changing of schedules and very fast paced. some people working with are lazy which means you do extra work. only part time very rarely hire fulltime
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers as needed, preparing food during allotted time, cleaning work area as needed and making sure all production is accounted for and marked down. "
good,Management( managers) are not professional! The work day was short. The co worker were ok except when family worked together it was hard to get them to do anything. I learned that at certain job there will always be a boss or manager that will make a great work the worst worker
good,"A productive work place and great people to share it with. It was hard at first working there, but I did learn a lot while being there."
good,"The workplace is productive, a team effort is seen and provided as well as respect for employees. It is a fast paced environment, therefore you have to learn to work well with others and still manage your time wisely."
good,"The management is the worst. they will only schedule you 15 hours a week but call you in every day for any hours. The only sort of training the give you is a 2 inch thick binder. The workers often call in and you will be expected to work up to an 16 hour shift. Many people come in the store and steal. The manager only sits in her office and watches the video tapes, she never helps with anything you need. Over all this job would be the worst job to choose as a career choice."
good,"Great employees, make for a fun work environment. overnight shift wasn't for me but I loved the work I did. I enjoyed ordering every week and facing shelves was something I regularly did. making the store look good made me feel good!"
good,"Great place to stop in for fuel and food.  Friendly faces in your hometown, greeting you daily.  100% customer focused, always ready with a smile!"
good,Casey's is a nice company to work for. I've learned to be very patient while working there. My co-workers are easy to work with. Dealing with difficult customers is the most difficult part of my day. The people I work with make each day enjoyable.
good,"Great place to work with good benefits. "
good,Went to work at 5am to make donuts and breakfast pizzas.  Making the donuts from scratch was alot of fun. Decorating the donuts on occasions.   Working in the same kitchen with my sister. it was alot blast.  Had great laughs with all co-workers and guest.
good,"The work I did was a challenge I liked that. I learned to place orders to drivers and carries. Management expected the stores filled even if you didn't have the means to do so. My coworker were very hard to get to know, but I did make friend. The hardest part of the job was filling orders when we didn't have the drivers or carries to do so. we were at their mercy. The challenge was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I enjoy the regular customers, my boss, and most co-workers. There isn't a hard part of my day. I learned to count down a safe and do deposits and other register things."
good,Great place. Was a very easy job and I made enough fun money while I attended college. I was cashier and all I had to do was work the front register and clean.
good,"It can be a busy job sometimes but, if you can get by the drama it's a good first job or for that little extra spending money. Corporate can be a huge pain to deal with. But, management is very friendly and can be pretty helpful when you need them. There is some less then productive employees. However, it's a pretty laid back job. The kitchen can get busy some days but it's steady work once you get a rhythm going."
good,Working at a 24-hour store you have to be on call all the time so you don't get much free time to enjoy days off. My overall experience has been enjoyable so far do to fun coworkers and a varying schedule.
good,would love to work for them again had lots of good people working there and great customers that was always happy to see you got to know every part of the building and every work station.
good,"I opened the store on a day to day basis. Learned to acquire a great understanding of professional working relationships, how to get delegated tasks finished in a timely manner, and the importance of quantity control. The most difficult part of the job was the process of icing the donuts within the allotted time limit. Feeling successful after accomplishing my daily tasks and knowing that I was making quality products is what was most enjoyable about this job."
good,It was one of the best jobs I have had. A typical day at work would be coming in around 2 and it would just be me and one other employee all night. I learned how to make pizzas which was very exciting. Management was okay but they never told us how we were doing at our work stations. The hardest part about the job would have been stocking the cooler and keeping it stocked. Between making pizzas and running the register we never had the time to get back there. The most enjoyable part would have to be being by myself. I knew what was expected of me and what my job duties where. I didn't need someone leaning over my shoulder to make sure I was doing it right.
good,"I enjoyed the fact the on a daily basis there was something interesting."
good,I was able to utilize my skill set of being a fast learner and given the opportunity to train others.
good,"Would run the register help customers, clean and stock the store."
good,"you delt with different situations and people, always had something to do."
good,I enjoy meeting new people and helping them when they need it.
good,Is a great place to work friendly environment. We great the customers and thank them when they leave they have great managers and even better coffee. Hardest part of the job is to keep up with the coffee and pizzas when its cold or a game night.
good,"Typical day at work is usually pretty busy for the most part, I have learned how cope with people and there attitudes, I have better customer service skills, like talking to people that I do not know, being able to take there order. The management is okay not the best. My co workers are what keep me going without them I may have gone crazy. The hardest part about my job is being so busy and there is no one there to back you up when a customer needs help with something and there are to many people in the line getting angry. The most enjoyable part about my job is getting to meet other people getting out of the house and being able to make other people happy."
good,A decent work environment pleasant management easy to learn skills.
good,My supervisor formed me into the manager I am today. I learned alot about the convience store operations but she taught me personable skills that I have used thoughout life.
good,"Most of my work weeks consisted of 90% travel time."
good,"co-workers left you with little to no toppings for pizzas, called in on nearly every day off, management was very helpful"
good,"Casey's is a great & equal employer. I have been with Casey's for over a year now. My experience has been great! A typical day at work is pretty easy. I learn to stick to my work and not to get distracted. The management at Casey's is very flexible with my school hours. My co-workers are leanient and work as a team. There is no hard part of the job, the only down fall of this job, is working a long 9 hour shift. A long 9 hr shift is draining and I think no one should have to work at a convience store for 9 hrs. There are no enjoyable part of the job. I'm at work and we don't get breaks & if someone doesn't come to cover register for, so you can use the restroom then, you just have to hold it."
good,Work with coworkers to provide a clean store. Provide customers with fast quality service. Cook according to a customers order.
good,"My day is always the same. During the week, I am either running the Cash register or I am working in the kitchen. When I am on the register I have a list of things that need done before the next shift comes in. And when I am in the kitchen you also have a list of items that need restocked and ready for the next shift.  Now when I work on the weekends,I come in at 4am and do a  count on cigarets and check my lottery to make sure its all correct and there wasn't any theft. Then I go into the office and do the book work. About 10am I head to the bank to get change for the store and deposit the money in the bank.  I then go back to the store and finish up my daily list before I leave at 12pm."
good,"I mainly liked this job, because I got to meet knew people all the time."
good,"I would have to keep the workplace in order and make sure the coffee was always refreshed every 30 minutes.  I would clean the counters, take out the trash, restock and organize the aisles, and sweep and mop the floors.  I learned how to maintain a cash register and deal with customers on a daily basis.  The management was very professional and efficient, they taught me how to do my job very quickly and efficiently without making it boring.  My co-workers were very professional as well, they never brought their home lives and problems to work, and they always maintained a productive pace.  The hardest part was dealing with the rush hours and making sure that nobody was trying to steal any products or gasoline.  The most enjoyable part would have to have been my co-workers.  I like listening to how different people view life and its complexities.  It can be very entertaining listening to how people explain situations that have happened to them."
good,"-A typical day at work was to clock in, count your money, serve the customers, stock materials such as: cups, straws, and lids, clean the floors, clean the soda machine, stock the coolers, empty the trash, clean the bathroom, and clean the outside area. After this was all done I would count the drawer down and lock the doors. "
good,I liked the customer interaction. The hardest part was standing on my feet for 10 or more hours at a time with no set breaks you got to sit down a minute here and a minute there never a good amount of time. 
good,"Good job, fun people to work with, did not get hours was told I would. "
good,You can't really have a set schedule. Hard to find someone to replace you if you need time off or are sick.
good,"I liked the job at Caseys. The atmosphere was fun. I learned a lot about teamwork because there was a bunch of us that opened the new store. I had a lot of illness during that time and they worked with my schedule. However, I was only getting a couple days a week and was going through a hard time and needed more hours. "
good,"Waited on customers, stocked shelves, operated gas pumps, made pizza when needed, cleaned store at end of shift."
good,"Went to work, filled papers out, worked the cashier, cleaned the store to close, counted money in drawer and safe. I loved working here it was fun."
good,"As soon as i got to work i started doing something, after that it was just one thing after another, which alot of is my choice to not take breaks cause i like for my day to go by fast. had good employees, didnt speak to the day manager much. best part for me was going into the cooler cause it made time go by pretty quick, or going outside to do the trash on a nice day. My working experience was overall great."
good,"Provided cashier experience for entire store. Maintain store appearance, and shelved backstock. Obtained telephone orders for pizza, and prepared pizza from scratch. I learned to be fast while taking telephone orders, and allowing a short time to prepare and cook pizza. Managment was kind and understanding to needs of employees. The hardest part of my job was preparing pizza orders without help. The most enjoyable part of the job was greating people as cashier."
good,I loved interacting with the customers every day. I am detail oriented so throroughly enjoyed doing paperwork when I was there.
good,Was a good job with good people for the most part. The pay was alright enough to stay cause i enjoyed the job. The one thing I had hard time with was trying to improve the store. Certien things weren't getting done that should of been and would have improved the store and some of the staff and manager didn't wanna do this.
good,shift I worked was good for me. Learned to work with the vendors. Hardest part of the job was filling ice machines. I really enjoyed working with the public and meeting new people.
good,"A family oriented, flexible organization. The management worked around my school schedule so that I was able to graduate on time. The atmosphere is friendly, and Caseys strives to be a good place for its workers and customers. It is also very clean."
good,"A typical day at work consist of running register or preparing food for the warmers. You learn everyday different ways to make the food better or quicker ways to cash customers out. Management is wonderful when you need that time off or someone to talk to cause your day is just not goin the way you need or want it to go. Co-workers work well together, more like a family all working together, and everyone helps everyone making your day run smoother and helping customers to get what they need and be able to hurry to their activities. Hardest part of the job is knowing that you cant please everyone even if you gave it your all. The entire job really is enjoyable."
good,I only worked here while I was in school. I did enjoy working with the people and the customers.
good,always busy with a lot of new things going on. new faces. lots of things to keep me busy on a daily basis. Never have the same work day twice. The shifts were flexible for my other obligations.
good,"Really enjoyed working here, the employees were down to earth, friendly, outgoing, fun and for the most part responsible. They were very courteous and helpful with the customers."
good,I enjoyed the job most of the time but lack of motivation from other employees tends to be problematic and while there were those who wanted to take corrective action others didn't.
good,Always have fun working with others. Even if its a bad day for you. Youre co workers will make it not so bad. Theres not much drama. Most people are happy working with this company
good,This job is very fast paced and can easily overwhelm people if they have never had to work in a fast paced work environment before. This job also attracts a lot of customers who are mentally ill and can be a little difficult to deal with at times.
good,Working for Casey's is fun unless there is a game of some sort going on. The people are just amazing and there is a great work environment. I would have to say that I like my job to an extent as I get along with most of my coworkers but dont like doing the same tasks everyday. The management is good but could be better as it seems like the store manager doesn't care about the company all the time.
good,"Good company to start with, not 100% sure about long term. As long as you do what is required of you the job is pretty easy and most people are easy to work with"
good,The people that work there are usually nice. they are always hiring new people. there is always stuff to do and great customers. they also have great food.
good,A typical work day would include me clocking in and going into the back to grab a chefs coat and id put it on and button it up. Then I'd walk out to the kitchen and usually the phone would be ringing off the hook so I would pick up the phone and start taking in orders. I then would take the make ticket that prints out of the receipt machine and I would walk over to the pizza prep table and I would hand the ticket up and put on some latex gloves. Then I would go weigh out thr dough and begine making orders till the end of the day.
good,I love this company as a customer. As a former employee I have a different view. Associates at the top of the pyramid only care about profits and bottom dollar. I seen very little compassion for employees as well as no rewards or incentives to be a great employee.
good,Casey's is a good place to work especially for those starting out or over in the workforce. The pace can be fast but staff is usually willing to help.
good,Pretty neat and organized place to work with friendly employees and customers. Fair room for advancement but also had to deal with a few customers who were being stuck up. About what you'd expect for a typical gas station job.
good,"I loved working at casey's. Great company, but poor management. I was offered a position, because i always stepped up and took on more shifts, and always did more then beyond."
good,"Allows you to meet many different people and collaborate with other employees. You have lots of opportunities to gain more hours, although long shifts can become very tedious."
good,"Casey's is a decent introduction into the retail world. This company strives to balance convenience with friendly customer service. For the most part, I would recommend Casey's as a great first job to a young adult."
good,"It's a nice little store, nice people, nice work ethic, good pace for yourself. Would recommend it, minimum wages.has everything u need as a convenient store."
good,"I worked as a general manager for almost 5 years.  good yearly raises as well as good benefits                                            "
good,It was a great place to work my manager was awesome to work with. She was willing to teach u and answer any questions you may have had.  I learned a lot from her
good,"It was a nice place to work. A job for people who need work experience and extra money. I wouldn't make a career out of it, yet it had a good culture there."
good,I enjoyed working for Casey's. It can be a very fast paced job or it can be slow all depends on the day. You learned new things each day. It was a good place to learn about customer service cause you get all kinds of people in a convenient store.
good,"Good job paid ok not hard labor , good work environment, flexible schedule , decent benefits easy job to learn good employees "
good,I worked there for 2 months pay was fair ! I didn’t want to stop working but I need more hours and want to get paid weekly if possible the night shift was more calm so I   Per for that
good,"Caseys has a great staff and overall is a good, safe feeling environment for someone to start their career in. Poor management can easily nip a new eager face right on the butt."
good,Casey's General Store was an overall good job. I made pizzas and put things through the oven. I grew tired of the job after I learned most things and it just became like food factory work. I felt slighted by the manager after working hard with good attendance and then a reduction in hours. I would say it is a good short term job unless you really want to continue with that line of work.
good,"Most co-workers and managers are easy to get along with, pay is significantly lower than other Casey’s stores within a 10 mile radius. No overtime, even for managers. Manger works with all types of situations. But a lot of people coming and going."
good,the employees where great for the most part and my manager was great. but didn't get along with a few employees on nights just cause the simply fact i worked for my paycheck and they got theres handed to them for just sitting around.
good,It was my first job I enjoyed it while I was there I took a lot of extra shifts and that was hard but it gave me a lot of experience i learned how to work a cashier and run the front of the store but I learned a lot of multitasking taking orders preparing food and dealing with customer in the kitchen but I got confused about scheduling and quit but I was planning to quit anyways because I was leaving outta town soon but over all I enjoyed working there
good,"I did love working here, but after gaining kitchen manager position, all went down hill. I wasn't allowed to do my job.  Getting things in order, having team meetings, or being heard on what needed to be done."
good,this is an ok place it needs better management but other than that people are friendly and its a great place to eat and shop. hours are ok they try to work with you on schedule
good,"I started out part time register 2+ years ago at a very small store in a town of 800 people.   I was fortunate enough to gain a new manager who transferred from a local store a year after I started and she showed me how amazing the company can be to work for if you work hard.  I became food service leader at my store and received a pay raise.  I worked a lot of hours but I chose too so I could make my store better and my customers my top priority.  I am now a 1st asst manager (with another raise) at a very large, busy store near campus of a large university.  I am fortunate enough to have 2 wonderful women as my area supervisor and district manager. There is plenty of potential with Caseys if YOU work it and show you want it.  I love this company and can't wait to see it grow bigger and better than ever."
good,"I loved working here. I usually came in when they called and needed someone to cover shift, until noone would cover for me. I would write off for days and didn't usually get them I would always be scheduled for the days that I would ask for. Yes I did get some of them off but not usually. Tried to go back to the store in my town and doesn't seem like they want me to come back, but won't give a answer."
good,Casey's was one of the best jobs I had they were friendly fun outgoing amazing co workers. No job I've had compared to Casey's I only left cause I needed something better paying.
good,"A very nice eviroment to be apart of and I love the continuous opportunities they have to offer at their establishment. I found myself there comfortable early, the training process was very comfortable and patient. Always room for improvement but that’s anywhere."
good,was full time didnt get hours. had to work after my husband was murdered and couldnt keep my mind on task. should of had 3 days paid off but i did not have anyone to crove for me even thow that was managers job
good,good company to work for. Only negative is corporate has a disconnect with the store level. discount food and drinks while working. Company accommodating to deaths and births in the family. Decent environment.
good,caseys as a business themself doesnt care about their employees.. but the manager at my store was the best she was considerate and is the reason why i stayed there as long as i did..
good,A typical work day would be making pizzas to keep in the warmer for customers every hour. making sure everything was clean. making sure the veggies and toppings were fresh. assisting orders and calls. The hardest part of the job is being rushed when there are multiple orders. The most enjoyable part of the jobs is seeing customers satisfied with their orders and working with the other employees.
good,It was a freat place to work and it was about the best job in that little town and if i had to go back there it is tha place that i would work at. Although the  manager i had did leave.
good,I started work at 3;30 Am prompt store for opening made donuts and breakfast cook off at 1030 Made 10 kinds including cake donuts when store opened I made breakfast pizza and other breakfast foods. Every Thursday truck day rotate food in freezer
good,"The environment wasn't bad, customers can be a bit abrupt at times. Manager is lovely and had no problems with her. District manager can be a bit abrasive but just following what was ordered for her."
good,"Clock in, prepared food for the day/filled out paperwork"
good,The small town caseys i worked at was a nice place under the previous manager. she believed in having a dedicated full time crew. when she retired the new manager changed that policy and slowly got rid of the entire original crew.
good,A typical day at caseys involves a lot of cleaning. I worked 2nd shift and it was clocking in and cleaning while also juggling customs needs. It also involves money handling. I learned how to manage my time efficiently and how to focus on multiple tasks at once. Management was always great & very accommodating to needs of employees.
good,"I liked working the kitchen more than the register just because you're always busy. There was never much downtime. I did not like the fact that we did not get set lunch breaks, it was just eat when you can. The job itself was not hard, anyone could do it. I only left because i wanted a different job and I did not want to work weekends or nights anymore."
good,"Casey's was a great company to work at but, I am looking for a career as opposed to only a gas station kitchen staff. There aren't any desired career advancements that are available for my development."
good,"Casey's is a great place for someone who hasn't worked yet it teaches cooking ,how to deal with money,and social skills they cover dental,vision,and health management is great they know how to work well with there employees such as flexible hours and understanding that some things take time to get use to"
good,Good place to work overall. Pay is decent with advancement opportunities. As long as you dont mind their poor managerial staff then you should be alright.
good,"Caseys is a good first job for new people to the workforce. There is opportunity for people to advance if your willing to put the time in. The only downgrade that i see is the rate of pay, and ability to make more hourly."
good,It was a great place to work except for when it came time for review and to get my raise. I mentioned it several times to management but received no answers nor did they do the review.
good,"I arrived 4 am started oven donut machine made all bake goods and breakfast food. Answered phone for store was located in kitchen kept soda and pop area clean and stocked. Kept kitchen clean and stocked."
good,Casey's is an excellent company to work for. The possibility for promotion is high. The job itself is rewarding and offers a great environment to work in.
good,Great and fun place to work with very little stress to worry about. Management was rarely involved unless it was a customer dispute. Very easy job with lots of possibilities.
good,"I was the assistant manager there for almost a year, i liked working for the company but the store manager overworked me: she would leave early all the time, never came in if a person was needed,  always just expected me to. When i had a huge family emergency going on and my dad was in the icu, she was trying to make me feel bad for not wanting to be at work and still overworked me, and ended up suspending me because of everything going on. I loved working for the company and would go back as long as i didnt have to work with her."
good,"A typical day is prep work and assisting customers to meet the needs and ensure a reliable shopping and dinning experience. The shifts can be hard and uneven, one day you will work four hours the next eight."
good,I enjoyed working for Caseys. The biggest issue was how much time was spent covering shifts because people did not want to show up for work. Other then that the work was easy but kept you busy. Injoyed it but moved on for a higher paying job.
good,This company was fun to work for. Fast moving not a day thats the same. Always something new to learn. Upper management is the issue with this company.
good,"As the head doughnut cook, i had many responsibilities. I was in charge of the morning food preparation, which started the minute I walked in the door. I took pride in my work."
good,Decent pay and decent hours the job itself is not that bad but if you get stuck with an idiot for a manager who cuts everyones hours so she can hire people she knows and likes then you will be fine.
good,Very fast paced at times.  Short staffed most of the time . The manager was not very nice and the assistant manager was very lazy and would cuss at employees
good,I love being employed for their company. Just wish there was a full-time position and high pay. Customers were the best and always made my days at Casey's much brighter
good,"I would (if asked) work there again my problem was i had too many things going on with plenty of time to do it, but when your Supervisor obviously doesn't care for you too much and is pretty verbal to other people but yourself then it doesn't work out so well."
good,I liked making pizzas and subs for the customers. i had a few customer that wouldn't get a pizza unless i was working. which made me feel great. management was good.
good,The co-workers were really friendly. The Casey's family is really great. The only benefits we received was the discount on food. The only reason I quit was I couldn't do two jobs at the same time(making bakery items and breakfast/pizza).
good,"friendly and helpful crew and management. managers were always willing to lend a helping hand when needed , such as stepping in the kitchen while in the middle of lunch rush to help make subs or pizzas, or coming in to work if a crew member needed time off and couldn't find a replacement."
good,Easy job but the manager was incompetent. I would have liked to stay and work my way up into management but I found a better opportunity and left. I worked very little hours and only stocked.
good,i enjoyed working there.  scheduling was very flexible and my manager worked with my school schedule.  it is pretty laid back with only a few employees so it is easy to also have fun.
good,I had a very fun and enjoyable time working at Casey's meet alot of new people. i think that for a young person it would be a very good place to start out as and get to know how things work.
good,"Sort of stressful at times during dinner rushes for pizza and sorts of needed items from a customer's requests. Also, sorted through the truck order during delivery dates."
good,Always busy during certain time of the year. There are some times you are slow and could be sent home. You keep food for only an hour and if not sold you throw it away and make fresh
good,"The work day here goes by fast you are constantly moving, sometimes it can be stressful but that is anywhere."
good,Loved making donuts and pizzas. Friendly atmosphere. Manager made you feel like family. Hated to leave but had to have a steady work schedule for the kids.
good,"great place to work, great coworkers can be tense at times and very stressful but i would work there again if i had too. discounts on food and drinks."
good,"During my work shifts there were always likes and dislikes about my job throughout the day. A few dislikes about the job would be how busy it could get during lunch and dinner rushes, when one or more co-workers would clock out and leave without finishing their responsibilities for that day, and lastly is the one day a week when our company truck delivered our produce."
good,"It pays well and at times it was very stressfull and quick-paced and other times it was very slow going. The pay was decent for the time being. I didn't like having to make the doughnuts at 3:30 in the morning some days, but it paid 50 cents extra so that was nice."
good,"At Casey's, we would always stay busy and not stand around doing nothing. A typical day would include ringing up customers at the register, mopping and cleaning the store. The hardest part of working at Casey's was keeping up with breakfast and dinner rush because it was hard to keep everything fully stocked."
good,I didn't like how favoritism was in the store. The employees were rude to customers. The manager wasn't managing fairly. Nobody wanted to clean bathrooms.
good,"Pretty laid back, fast paced environment, great people, putting away truck sucks. I met a lot of great people working here. Most customers are great. Cashier position is pretty easy but you MUST know how to count!"
good,"I learned a lot working at Casey's General Store, what I learned is how to really work in a environment where you have to make a lot of food and prepare them for customers that want to by the food. Also I learned how to work as a team and never stress about the job because at the end of the day you will get the job done correctly and you will learn from  your mistakes. It was my first time working at a Gas station but I really enjoyed working there because it was a new experience for me."
good,"I've been working at Caseys for about 6 months part time, they have a very friendly staff, pay is decent and chances for advancement. 4 out of 5 stars in my opinion."
good,I worked at Casey's during my high school career and I didn't enjoy it very much. I will admit though it taught me a lot and helped me with experience for future  jobs.
good,"turn over rates was high, each day was busy or slow hit or miss, three managers in six months each ran the store differently . shifts changed often one month could be all day shifts the next over nights."
good,While I was as Casey's General Store I was able to pick up some skills that I otherwise would not know today such as cooking and running a cash register. While the enviornment was laid back at times  there would be rushes and we would be busy but overall a really enjoyable job.
good,"There's never ""Nothing"" to do, its the perfect job for those who do not wish to have idle hands. You are constantly moving or busy, but you always have time for the customer."
good,"This is a good place to work. It is fun and balanced place to work. As long as you are a quick learner and know some sense about food, this would be a good place to work"
good,"I enjoy working at Casey's General Store. I think if there was more advancement opportunities I would stay and work my way through the company. However, in my location there are not many opportunities to advance into the company."
good,"loved the customers and many ofthee employees,however the store managerat the time had no back bone and that allowed the store to be ran poorely. One assisitant manager was allowed to behave extremely poorly not only to the customers but the his co-workers as well. i had taken a positioned and was only suppose to be on overnights for a short period of time until someone was hired, thatnever happened until i decided to terminate myself and leave a company i trully loved."
good,"Lot of great people, and management was great. Really fair pay for work that you do. Manager was really good about when requesting days off, but sometimes was bad at the same time."
good,"I've never quite experienced a work culture quite like this one. No matter what, if you are an employee of Casey's you are family. We all strive to be better every day."
good,"Everyone knows their responsibilities. Some people work harder than others. Some have to compensate for others lack of motivation. Unless we have more than the usual amount of customers, it is very easy to keep up with the work. My co-workers are easy to get along with and make working fun. The manager is very understanding when it comes to schedule changes."
good,Loved working with the public. I'm a people person. My coworkers were cool. The job in general was easy. When working in kitchen people loved the pizzas I made. I'd have people call and ask specifically for me to make their pizza. Lol loved my job just needed better paying job cuz life
good,"Casey's always worked with my schedule and emergencies if any. They were always honest with me and open to new ideas.For the most part, I was taken care of and liked my job there."
good,Working as a cashier at a local store allowed me to meet many new people.  They worked with me on my schedule as this was a part time second job that allowed me to make some extra money.
good,While working here I enjoyed interacting with customers. I learned how to deal with angry customers. The management was good. The hardest part of my job was working late then waking up early the next morning for work.
good,As a manager youre always on call and have to fill in whenever someone feels like not coming in. Youre incharge of all things to do with a store. Some disctricts train better than others.
good,"It was a great place to work, Sadly though one of the managers treated me like I wasn't good enough, All my other co-workers agreed she killed the vibe of working there, Very rude, other than that i loved everything else about it ! Loved my co-workers.the best part of the job was talking to a variety of people! always something new."
good,With this being my second job it was kind of hard to get into it but after I became more fluent it became extremely easy and memorizing all the different sandwiches and pizzas actually became fun and i don't think i will ever forget how to make donuts and i wouldn't have figured it out without Caseys
good,We always run into the problem of not having enough people on night shift which made it very difficult to complete all tasks and assist customers and have work prepared and ready for morning shift.
good,Had a good time working here would definitely recommend this job to others! Had a lot to learn and a lot of different things to do. The managers were all nice and very helpful.
good,"Fun place to work, management is a little high of themselves. After raise weekly hours dropped significantly. Lots of hours standing which isn't bad. Co-workers are nice just new people come and go."
good,It's a fun environment to work in. Great people and great managment. It had it's ups and downs but every job does. Hours weren't always steady but for the most part they were.
good,"It's just a typical part time job that pays minimum wage or a little better. Good wok environment, and an easy job. Unless you plan on becoming a manage there, I would not make a career out of making pizzas. Overall, a pretty good low stress part time job."
good,"A typical day at work, I would stock the cooler with drinks and food. I would also use a cash register. Handling money and communicating with customers was also included in the cashier's duties.  I also cooked pizza, taking over the phone orders for pizza pick ups, and keeping a clean and well organized kitchen was all part of the cooks duties. Working in a team format means a lot to me, I really enjoy people and working with people."
good,"Ran cash register  and helped customers find what thy needed. Opened or closed registers and managed paperwork and correct balance on a daily basis. Made pizzas, sub sandwiches, salads and kept things in stock needed for sales."
good,"Management hasn't stayed long (at the location I worked, as well as other nearby locations). We plow through employees, partly due to lack of management or management with lack of good skills (management, people, along with other), due to small town drama, lazy employees, and slacking in attention from higher authorities (district and above)."
good,typical day was working register. i was trained in front and in kitchen.   the management was decent. my co-workers were great to work with. the hardest part was first learning till. the most enjoyable was when regulars came in.
good,It was an easy job. You would do the same thing day after day.  My co-workers were nice and easy to work with.  We would always try to have fun when we worked and were allowed to have some creativity.
good,This job was a normal gas station job. I had spent a short amount of time here due to starting my externship at the jail. It was a fun place to work that had a great group of people that worked there.
good,"My experience at Casey's has been admirable. Lots of kind people who love to bring smiles to the customers they are serving. My wages are good and would be acceptable by a young man/women in college , or wants to get a basic outlook on the workforce. Benefits are casual, but can be pursued depending on your meaning for the job. The management can be sometimes unprofessional, but very open minded and aware of everybody's progress."
good,A typical day had me at a different store every day in a different town. Not bad if you like to travel. I learned more about motivating people than at any previous job experience.
good,"Great people to work with, very accomidating, flexible, but dont care if you get breaks or not, co-workers get along real well and so do managers"
good,"Learned to work well with others, lots of customer service skills required. Worked with vendors. Difficult transition from co-worker to assistant manager with staff, learned how to cope with being manager staff you previously were equal status with."
good,I liked this being my first full-time job. It made me feel the weight of responsibility and customer care.
good,"I am generally the one doing the food preparation, and some days I have to run deliveries. I spend the busier hours making pizzas, and the slower hours making sure everything is cleaned, stocked, and prepped. Once all that is done I find something to clean. My co-workers are great and a very diverse group. I love to cook, so i enjoy my job."
good,"stocking band preping was enjoyed"
good,I liked this job even though it wasn't what I had applied for. The pay was decent and it was within walking distance to my home. I already had a full time job and it became overwhelming with the schedule I had to maintain. My husband had a serious motorcycle accident and was hospitalized for five months just before my last two shifts and did not get to complete my notice of vacating my position.
good,"I like working there, my co-workers are great people to work with. We do get busy during the lunch and supper rushes not only at those times but those are the busiest times of the day.  I have learned that I work well with others, that i am a fast learner, and that management when training new employees they want me to do all of it because I know what I am doing and that I am the best at what I do.  The most enjoyable part of my job is coming in and seeing all the smiling faces.  I don't really have a hard part of the job but sometimes it is hard when not everything is done and makes my job harder to do."
good,Enjoy the socializing that comes with the job. Meeting new people everyday.
good,"A very fast and fun paced work environment. I have learned how to control myself and handle customers in negative confrontations. Fun co-workers to work and the shifts go fairly fast. The management team work well on company numbers and making the profit of the store grow, The hardest part of the job is the short notice of work schedule and bouncing from shift to shift on a daily basis. I extremely enjoy working with the public."
good,"part time job"
good,It is a gas station/ convenience store. not really much to say about it.
good,"Typical day at work includes clock-in verifying money matches whats on hand. Switching over with co-worker on the the register, and watching the gas pumps,checking customers out, helping them find things. Making sure our customers are satisfied and happy before they walk out our doors."
good,"A typical day at work was helping our customers with whatever they needed, made sure that when ordering supplies that we had enough and ordered what our customers liked; going in the morning counting cigarettes, balancing out the day sheets, scheduling employees, making sure the area was clean. Had fun doing my job.And I gave my everything to my job performance."
good,"Overall a good company with steady growth, I have learned a lot about running a business. They do not take care of their employees on front line most live in poverty and are treated harshly for small policy infractions."
good,"This was basically to pay the bills at school. Nothing to write home about, but nothing really to complain about either."
good,A typical day at Casey's is I come in early I clock in and I get my uniform on and then either go in the kitchen or go up to the register. Then you either start making food and cleaning the kitchen or you sign in to the register.
good,"Casey's is a great company to work for however as a store manager your Area Manager needs work as well as the District Manager. Phone calls, texts and emails go un answered and the excuse is they are so busy to answer you back!!"
good,"Since I was only a part time worker, I was not able to get all of the benefits that I would have been able to if I were working full time hours. But there is way too much drama inside the work environment"
good,Not a bad company to work for. Sometimes expects you to work harder for such an easy job. Customers can be great most of the time. You find out where your groove is there quickly.
good,"This was a great place to work. People were easy to get along with, customers were almost always great and normally left happy, and all the employees always had a smile on their face. Other employees always became good friends."
good,"I would start my shift around 4:30 a.m. I had run lotto reports, open the safe, deposit the money at the bank, as soon as it was ready. I also had to drive around to find and compare other gas prices. I had fun at the store from meeting so many customers that began to feel like family."
good,I worked here while raising my daughter before I met my husband  and for a single mom the job was great. I only left to fulfill my dream in the medical field.
good,"This job can be stressful at times, especially when we get slammed with orders. The people are fun to work with. They are funny and very kind. they care what's going on in the store."
good,Caseys is a good place to work good environment and good people. The hours and work at Casey's are really flexible. And they will be understanding about your home life as well
good,"I am a people person, and you have to be one to work in customer service, and this is the job for me.  You have to be available whenever they need you, and do not expect ANY weekends off.  You just need to work the schedule they give you. Asking for more than 1 day off in a row will not happen.  The job is very hard, and if you like to be busy, like I do, this is the job for you.  I LOVE my manager there."
good,Loved the people and manager just not the jumping from shift to shift wish I was at one shift all the time . I wanted something consistent and not have to worries about not having same shift . I didnt like working 3am-1pm the 3-10am shift was perfect but couldn't do it anymore .
good,I worked over night so it was hard to day much. Though it was generally a good time. I was however located in a very small town and in a store that stopped over nights at some point after I started. This did cause some problems down the line.
good,I really enjoyed working at casey's general stores. The work was not too difficult and the pay is more than adequate. I would recommend this job to anyone interested in working in a gas station.
good,Caseys is a good company to work for.  You get to meet a lot of interesting people and learn how to interact with the public.  If you pay attention and put the work in you can move up rather easily.
good,Great for a part time job!!!!  would recommend to someone looking for a part time job.  The staff and customers are great to deal with....  friendly and caring
good,"Its a good job, it can be very demanding at times. Most of the employees were easy to hey along with. Sometimes it could be fun. Other times it was draining on you."
good,"I find the job can be really rewarding , you meet different people all the time and build a family among the staff. The hours can be long but manageable."
good,"There has been layoffs at the area supervisor level, the new ceo promises to visit stores but never does, and the new district manager makes racist jokes or uses racial slurs."
good,i worked overnights and it way one of my favorite jobs but day and evening shift can be really hectic you need to have good time management and work well under pressure
good,I loved my job. I miss the people I would meet every day. I would go in and open the store in the morning and get the book work done before we opened.
good,Alot of time I had to work my shift and half or all of another shift. When someone called in management wouldn't come in till five hours after the next shift would come in.
good,"I have worked at Casey's for 10+ years. First as a full time employee, and in the last two years have gone to part time d/t 2 foot surgeries. "
good,A good job with great fellow employees. The manager was really nice and worked with people with stuff they needed. Very easy job to do as long as you work well with others and have very good social skills
good,While it can be a fun environment some customers can be extremely bad and annoying but there are also your nice customers that you can have a good conversation with every day. Manager tries to work with your hours but if you keep giving them away to others every week she will change how many you are getting.
good,a typical day is relatively easy with a lot of busy work. I learned that work in retail can be very customer driven. The management team varies in quality depending on location. the hardest part of the job is keeping busy during the slowest part of the day. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know people.
good,"""If you have time to leave, you have time to clean"" was very enforced, I would work 7 hours, which eventually turned to 9 hours, without sitting down. My back and feet hurt daily because of everything we had to accomplish in one shift."
good,"Caseys is very flexible with your schedule especially if you have more than one job! I love working there , because the people that are there are super nice , and I love to stock and engage with different people that walk into Caseys!"
good,I like working here for the most part. Managers are decent. Its a nice location with consistent business. Nightly duties are tough when working alone which happens more often than not.
good,It was a stressful job due to the fact i worked at night and had to make food for in store and phone orders while making donuts for morning display. The supervisor does not allow colored hair or visible tattoos even though i started that job with red hair and the breaks are short and not always guaranteed
good,"Worked as cashier for mid day shift and performed daily side work.  Brewing coffee/ tea, cleaning, trash etc.  Hardest part of job was learning to ring up lottery sales and cash out procedures."
good,I love the job and I still currently work there. I like the management and I really love working with the customers and the other people employed there. It’s a very nice and comfortable place to work.
good,"I worked here over the summer. I had to leave in the fall due to college. "
good,I've seen stores ran horribly and I've seen stores ran great. The company itself is great to work for. You will get out of the company what you are willing to put into the job
good,I liked working there and had great co-workers. we were givin discounts and the hours were kind of flexible. Great manager when I was there. I had no problems. Quit due to medical reasons
good,"i enjoy working with the public. i enjoy the type of job a convenient store offers. started me out a little higher pay rate then minimum wage, a few weeks later raised minimum to what i was making and didn't compensate me. a received my yearly raise in august, the company raised hiring rate to $10 and did not compensate me the difference so now every employee making same as i am and i habe been with the company longer. i feel they don't care about the employee just the company making money."
good,"I have learned a lot about generally taking care of a store and running a complex cash register. It is generally relaxed and there is never too much work. I wish I was able to get more breaks. It is hard to stand for so long without sitting. However, there is enough down time to have a bit of chit chat."
good,This job was temporary as was my living in this town which is why I wasn't there very long. Great work environment. I love working with people so this job was great for me.
good,I liked working at caseys but i couldnt afford rent by myself and it is difficult to get promotions or full time work. The hours were not fixed and difficult to keep up with.
good,"I worked in a Casey's with a slower atmosphere than most. We always keep our store clean and the customers love us very much. It was a temporary job for me. If you work towards being a manager, and then a store manager, you could make good money. They are opening new stores every year, and new store managers start somewhere around 40-45k per year. I was the Food Service Leader ("
good,"Taking care of customers and getting them on their way quickly is a key part of working here. Fuel, snacks, or even a full meal can be what a customer wants."
good,Casey's was a great place to work for the most part. Most coworkers were friendly. Had trouble with some management members. Made decent money but worked A LOT of hours because there were a lot of call ins and many times we were short staffed. The job is really easy if you do your job and do it right instead of complaining about it or expecting someone else to do it for you.
good,Liked working here very friendly management and other employees' were awesome just needed more hours. a typical day would be making sandwiches and helping whomever was making pizzas and running register
good,"I made homemade breads, rolls, pizzas, made sandwiches, salads.  Worked at the register cashing out Customers.  Making sub sandwiches and pizza along with other items to sell to customers, I love people and I love working with anyone."
good,"I had a good experience working there. I loved my job, my coworkers, customers, ect.. But, management was not very good, at all. We had changes done to schedules without notice. Hours and days changed without notice. Basically, had to check schedule everytime we came in, whether it was for work or just as a customer."
good,I took pride in managing my store. Always controlled the bottom line and made bonus. I went on vacation and lost my job. Wasn’t much of a person to stick up for myself. I made attempts to contact corporate but they wouldn’t even listen to my side. Very unfair. I enjoyed working at Casey’s
good,Working at Casey’s was an experience. It is very fast paced and there is opportunity to move up if you are a good employee. You learn a lot. The hours were the only thing that kinda sucked. I went from working the night shift (3:30-11:15) to working the morning shift (3:30 am-2 pm). It was a rough adjustment.
good,"Good place to work part time."
good,"consistent productivity, competitive, clean environment. I opened the store in the morning counted drawers, save, lottery and lotto, made coffee, checked pumps, cleaned counters off set news papers out, checked bathroom and stalls, shift change count cigs, stock coolers, unload truck, re count drawer, do end of shift drop."
good,"Enjoyed working with co-workers and customers. Sometimes could be fast paced depending on how many orders were received that night. Was always something to do, never got bored."
good,"I worked at a truck stop Casey's on overnight and it wasn't to bad, it pays decently for the work and the management seemed pretty okay. My coworkers were also pretty cool. Some of the truckers could be rude but for the most part they were cool"
good,I loved working at Casey's if they would have had a better work environment I would have never left. They have great pay and it is a good place to work it is a medium paced work environment.
good,I was pregnant at the time of my employment and they worked well with my situation. I also had my appointment dates off and they made sure I had the breaks I needed. I had great co-workers who helped if it was needed. The hardest part was just standing while being really pregnant. I loved the environment of the work place.
good,"It’s nice environment people were nice, pay rate was okay for the job. It’s gets pretty busy at times but with the excellent work of the crew we always gets it done."
good,I liked the job experience i gained from caseys. The team orientation was a fun and energetic one. A lot of responsability to keep up with the demands
good,friendly customers in and out daily. Great coworker who were nice and respectful. strict but fair management. Only allowed to work part time though because they could only maintain so many full time employees
good,"A typical work day began with me waking up at 3:30 in the morning just to be ready for work at 4:00. From 4:00 to 2:30 I had to do all of the kitchen work alone, always causing me to work late sometimes by 1.5 hours."
good,"Overall a good place to work. Nice people to work with.   But, has unstable hours. Raises are only once a year. Not a very good chance of advancement in the company."
good,I love working at Casey's and the managers and my coworkers. And it's very productive and a fun workplace to be at. The hardest part of the job sometimes is keeping up with the customers.
good,I made a lot of friends at Casey's including my supervisor. It was great environment to work in. I love working with people and helping them. I definitely would work for Casey's again.
good,"Working at caseys was a good job, dealing with drunk people has it ups an downs. I had to deal with intoxicated people and kids trying to use fake IDs. You have to always keep a look out for your team and the customers"
good,"Fast paced, good work environment. Did well as a temporary job while I was in college. Good company to work for. Discount on food and free fountain pop wile on the clock!"
good,Casey's was one of my favorite jobs I've ever had. The management was very laid back but still kept their professionalism. This job had a very good sense of community and regulars really enjoyed shopping at our store.
good,Great management team was excellent hours was great pay was ok very helpful staff over night was quiet food service department were great really miss the team
good,great place to work if you have an open availability. co-workers are fun and make me want to be there. great pay for the easy work required. expect to be expected to work an open availability.
good,"I learned so much working for Casey's. I was trained by the manager herself, & I believe I learned more from her than actual hands-on work. It was a fun job. Staff was competent, friendly, & most took pride in their positions, & store location. I like the fact that the store was located close to the college, so it was really convenient."
good,a typical day would see me either behind the register or preparing food. other duties would be between these such as cleaning and rotating food. also facing shelves and putting out back-stock.
good,Come in at night and clean and stock store for next day. You would also run the register because they are a 24 hour facility. The store manager is excellent
good,"The only issue while I worked there was with management, it seemed they didn't have stuff in order and that was the only time it could get stressful. Other than that, the customers are great, good team environment, and it's easy to feel welcome there as an employee."
good,"A day at Casey's consists of many things from greeting customers to counting money to close your shift down. I learned at this job, everyone has to put in their best effort to make an enjoyable work environment. The hardest part of the job was handling rude customers."
good,Casey's has great benefits and in some stores a very fun and happy environment. Managers are nice and employees are happy for most of the time. As any job is stressful especially in management. The training department is doing well to try and train consistly overall.
good,I would usually work overnights and take pizza orders and fulfill them. I would interact with customers and assist them if needed. If I worked cashier I would make money transactions and I even had to take the deposits to the bank a few times.
good,"Casey's General Store was always good to me. The Assistant Manager and Store Manager were easy to work with, always asking you to do secondary duties instead of telling you. The hours are very flexible, just short of making your own schedule."
good,"I worked at the truck stop in Hesston and it was always a blast. I was constantly on the move stocking, cleaning, and cashing customers out. There was never a boring moment and you never went without work! The pay is lower which is expected working basic retail, but if you love staying busy than this is the place to work. I will always swear by that truck stop!"
good,"A great working environment for the youth that is looking for part and full-time positions. There's a lot that you can learn working at a Casey's, you'd be surprised! A few different positions: General manager, first assistant, second assistant, kitchen manager, donuts, pizza, subs, register, delivery."
good,"provided customer service, did paperwork, truck orders, loved interacting with customers, hardest part was being told I didn't have the experience to move up in the company."
good,"calm days at most,learn how deal with stress.There was alots of mgs. in that store.okay culture.dealing with race slurs! i enjoy the peoples and job.."
good,"You wake up, shower, put clean uniform on, go to work on time no more than 10 minutes early. Customer service is first, most days are about the same, work your shift, make the best of times with your coworkers and customers. The hardest part is keeping the shelves clean, cooler stocked, and keeping up with Friday night pizza rush. Really it is what you make of it. It can be a very rewarding job."
good,Caseys could be a fast pace job at times and then slow at times but always enjoyed workig there and enjoyed the customers that came in on a daily basis.
good,This job seemed more like a job that I could have advanced in. There was plenty of opportunity to advance to Manager and even up to General Manager. They do advance positions internally.
good,"I only worked for a Casey's General Stores for a year however i feel that I have grown as a person for working there, the only real problem is the management. It seemed as though they were always at each other's throats...at least, two of the managers."
good,"My store is very clean and organized and I pride myself on this. I love being busy and wanting to be a manager of a Casey's."
good,"Everything you do at Casey's is for your customers (if you're a good employee). However, management will often push hours onto you; asking you to pick up shifts, stay late, come in early. There are times at some locations where you can end up working 19+ hours in a day and still have to come in the next morning. Turn over rate is high and there is always someone new to train. Many of the employees don't seem to care about their jobs making all the other good employees have to pick up the slack."
good,"Your work experience definitely depends on the location youre at. My location was fun for a while, good overall staff with only a few exceptions until management turned over. Staff got frustrated with no real leader, promotions happened within store just to keep it running (favoritism involved) but managers were not respected because of their attitudes. Overall, the actual workload isnt bad and the job is comfy if youre okay being on your feet all day."
good,"I absolutely loved this company. I think the hardest part of this job would be dealing with the different types of people you meet everyday. But you'll have regulars, and just as any other job there's going to be something that someone doesn't live vs others."
good,"It was always very fast paced, you always had something to do, everyone was very respectful of one another and treated each other and costumers with kindness and like how they would want to be treated."
good,"A typical day at Casey's General Store consists of making coffee, having a clean environment by sweeping and mopping floors. Ringing up customers for gas and food. Washing the smocks if have extra time and has completed all other chores. Hardest part of the job is when you need to change the coffee and its busy, customers would get upset. Most enjoyable part of Casey's General Store is the everyday customers that would put a smile on your face."
good,I really enjoy working for caseys I just wish I made more money. And more hours. Also it sometimes hard to work with management. Other than that I love all the friendly faces and the small talk with customers.
good,Loved working at caseys great co workers and great clean environment. Best customer service job i have ever had. Great benefits offered and good starting pay!
good,"Fast pace job, with high demand. Decent amount of employee conflict with in the work place, making it a stressful job. Learned the importance of staying out of other peoples drama."
good,"There was always something to do and busy. I had built a relationship with customers, coworkers and management. My duties changed on a daily basis as to what was needed."
good,"I loved the job and the management was great. I loved meeting new and friendly faces each and every day. This job tremendously increased my overall work ethic and job skills. However, I did not particularly enjoy starting my day at 4:30 in the morning, although it was not so bad that I could not accomplish my duties."
good,"I showed up and made pizza in the kitchen it was normally me and 2 others in the kitchen one cook, one runner, and one sub maker. I worked at Casey's short term it wasn't a job i enjoyed very much"
good,Arrive at 3a.m. start to make doughnuts until about 4a.m. at which point i begin to make breakfast pizzas and the other food that is required. Around 9 a.m. i begin to clean the kitchen in preparation for the next shift.
good,"Helping customers check-out, stocking shelves and cigarettes, dry-mopping, mopping, window cleaning, trash. Fronting and facing cooler shelves, stocking ice for pop machines, as well as, ice cooler. Wiping down counters. While working for Casey's General Store, I gained work ethic, and responsibility. Skills in working a cash register, credit card reader, money order machine, and lottery/scratch/instant win ticket readers. Management is helpful, mainly with medium supervision once management can see that you've gotten the skills down for the job. If you're not producing the required results in your job area, management will give you chances to achieve better results. The co-workers are kind and level-headed. Co-workers also keep personal and work lives separate. Keeping an eye on the gas pumps, while customers are in the store. The most enjoyable part are the customers, and their satisfaction."
good,I was in a half way house when they hired me I decided to be honest right away. I was going to go to college in Grand Island but did not and they understood when I left. It was good job with lots of friendly people and customers.
good,"Its very hard to advance with this corporation, it takes Years! The store management and upper management are always a pleasure to deal with and our customers are great. "
good,I took customers and rang there stuff up every other weekend I did paper work and did bank runs and check gas prices . The customers were always pretty cool and we always had regular customers that came in and made the job go alot faster because they always had something new to talk about !
good,Casey's is a good company in a lot of ways. There are some things that could use some work. I have  been with Casey's for 13 years and they have been good with the benefits for their employees. Some of the most recent changes are a little bit not so good.
good,This job was my most interesting job to say the least. We had a lot of interesting customers come into the work place as well as a vast majority of different employees with different backgrounds. I wouldn't say that I had any bad experiences besides it being biased on who would be a manager.
good,Was a great place to work at one time. Store Managers changed about 3 times during my time there. Everytime came with new rules and changes. whcih was very annoying.
good,I liked my job and was always happy to be there. I learned how to put information on the computer for the books. I got along well with my co-workers and manager.
good,"Meet and greet customers. Keep store clean and product stocked, neat and organized. If you need time off they are pretty reasonable with working around vacations and life events."
good,"Steady on most days. I learned to do other jobs other than my "
good,"Prepping, baking, an food safety management. Management changed 3 time in a year.  Co-workers did not enjoy their jobs.  Hardest part of this job was watching all the negativity between management and employees. Working with customers and my final produce I have prepared for the customers."
good,"typical day at work was cleaning, running a register, helping the kitchen person, paperwork, schedules, and making sure everyone was on top of their own job duties.  i learned how to handle paperwork,and handling money, and schedules. my co-workers were great people. we all was like a family.the best part of the job was getting to work with my co-workers and the customers that came in everyday. knowing that i put a smile on their faces just made my day."
good,I got along with my coworkers and learned how to do everything very easily with the training i had received. The hardest part of my job was trying to watch the register while in the back of the store cleaning or stocking the shelves. The most enjoyable part was seeing regulars come in and having a good conversation with them about their day.
good,come to work and run cash register or cook pizzas or make sandwiches for customers. i learned to cook pizzas and run the cash register and count money. the management there was awesome. my co-workers were fun to work with. the hardest part of the job was closing cause there was a lot to do in a short amount of time. the most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with customers.
good,Fun and accepting people to work with. Management is very understanding and willing to work with you as needed. I don't dread going to work every day but I do not enjoy the sporadic hours and different shifts.
good,"Advance quickly due to my hard work ethics; Assisted manager with ordering supplies, cleaning and various other duties; no two days alike"
good,Was a fun and interesting place to work .All the people i worked with were polite and helpful.Manage was helpful and able to help when needed .considerate about personal needs
good,It was a gas station/pizza cook kind of like a Seven Eleven. It was a fun area to work in meeting a lot of original customers and having a lot of smiles.
good,Its a good place to stop in and get snacks and fuel up your car. Fun people to work with. Meet a lot of people that come there. The manager was great guy.
good,My customers at Casey's are generally great. My co-workers are also wonderful and everyone seams to get along great for the most part. The management has favorites and I personally think that it is odvious but I love my job.
good,"As the assistant manager, i loved the fast paced job and the job itself. The only complaint i would have would be unpredictable hours. Working 2 pm to 1130 pm, that would be my nights and i would stay up to 4 am. There were times where i would get a call at 430 am telling me a employee couldn't make it so i would have to go in and work 5 am to 2 pm. There has been days where i would have to work 18 hours because of unreliable employees. You just never know."
good,"Enjoyed preparing food for the general public and the interaction with customers of all walks of life. Co-workers were easy to work with and enjoyable. Management was disrespectful and condescending and blamed their mistakes on others but demanded respect not deserved. I enjoyed preparing food and enjoyed pleasing customers with quality food and customer service. It was a challenge to prepare donuts and have them out on time and I made it my daily challenge despite pizza and sub orders that disrupted the process. I enjoyed my job.I learned to be efficient and time control. Preparing all kinds of food and making pizza was fun, enjoyable and self fulfilling when customers and coworkers enjoyed what was prepared."
good,"Management was flexible, a day at work was keeping the team in mind and getting things done for the day and preparing the next shift. Some of my co-workers were easy to work with and helped me accomplish a lot, where some slacked off and made others fall behind. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you have completed your job and have impressed your management and corporate. I'd say the hardest part is when someone has not prepared things and you have to work extra hard regardless of the reason just because its in your best interests to catch things up. I've learned from working with Casey's that no matter what happens you have to think about the costumers and company at the end of the day."
good,"Overall it is an alright place to work. The regular customers are fun to talk with, for the most part fellow employees are good to work with."
good,Constantly busy...always something to do. Teammembers are nice and fun but get the job done.
good,"While working at Casey's General Store, just got to clean the store and check off on a list what we have done and need to done. I have learned you can not always make friends with your co-workers. We have some that don't like to work and others that work super hard to get their job done. Not always does everyone work together. The most enjoyable park of my job is the fun customers that come in and we get to joke around and have a good time! That some of the customers appreciate the work you do to keep the store looking nice."
good,"Meeting once a month. Management wasn't very good."
good,Helping customers with purchases. My co-workers are great to work with. Together we get things accomplished. The hardest part of the job is getting everything accomplished that needs to be done. The most enjoyable part is getting to know some of the customers and talking to them.
good,it is a perfect job for a person in school of any sort. the days went by quicker when busy. the work space is decently roomed. the employees are easy to cooperate with.
good,"Work very closely with customers, assisting inside and outside of store or directing, keeping store clean. "
good,"well the manager was a good one she did a good job for a manager but when it came to people haveing to do to with feurnals wanting time off for vacations people being sick and such she didnt care u had better b at work unless u were on your death bed i like a strick manager but thats not right."
good,"enjoyed seeing the regular customers and meeting customers needs. seems as we were always needing help, though.  once you'd get a team together, someone would move on to another job. with small work force, it was difficult to cover absences"
good,"•	Greeted customers and provided excellent customer service."
good,"Assisted customers by running cash register, lotto tickets and EBT sales. Stocked merchandise and cleaned store. Made sub sandwiches, salads, and pizza for the deli and for customer's orders."
good,"day at work was clocking in an counting my drawer an start checking customers out . i learned that if u are going to work at the only cash register early in the morning you have to learn quick an fast .  when i started my management was laid back but still was a manger  towards the end got a new manger an he wanted to be a friend not manger . my co-worker where awesome always there to help u out an if you need to switch a day they where there to help you out. the hardest part was when you have a angry customer come in an they would start arguing with you about some price in the store , then you would have to explain we don't mark the stuff that corporate does all that"
good,"I enjoyed working at Casey's General Stores, and really miss the store where I worked! I started out working in the kitchen, then was trained as cashier, where I did extremely well, and eventually was promoted to assistant manager! It is easy to get promoted, as long as you are doing your job and are dependable and reliable."
good,customer service oriented. learned how to keep track of the register and purchases.
good,A typical day at work involves working either a 7 hour shift or 4 hours at a time.  I have learned better ways of dealing with customers to ensure that their needs are met.  I have no complaints about my manager or my fellow co-workers.  Everyone seems to pretty much work as a team to keep the place running in an orderly fashion.  The hardest part of the job is having to work evenings when I could be at home with my son and getting used to working weekends again when I was in a previous job that did not require working on weekends.  The part of the job I enjoy the most is the contact with the public and the fact that I live in the same town so getting to work is a breeze.
good,"Help manager with what ever he needs done, make sure all product is stocked and put in right place. Check in vendors,count money for bank deposit, make sure employees are in uniform and are staying busy."
good,"Was  cashier that opened the store so all opening duties including counting down cash drawer and safe, counting inventory and lottery tickets. It was a very easy job if you can deal with a public setting."
good,"Over all, Casey's is a great place to work for, its just not a job that fits me as a person for the rest of my life. Managment is good except for second manager. She is just not managment material. All the co-workers are great other than some workers are not motavated to do any of their work at all. The most enjoyable part about the job was the hometown atmosefear, and how most the time anyone there that was working or came in would give you the shirt off their back. "
good,"I typically keep busy, which makes the day go by fairly fast and easy. Management is understanding and flexible. Co-workers are fun and easy to work with and great at being cooperative. The hardest part of my workday is trying to keep up with making pizzas on an extremely busy night, which really isn't that difficult of a task. The most enjoyable part of my work day are the co-workers I work with, making it an enjoyable place to work. "
good,"A typical day would be coming in before store opened and doing the books and accounts from the day/night shifts prior to the current work day. Making sure everything was in order and gathering the deposit for the day and taking to the back to deposit. Watching over the employees making sure that they performed their jobs as needed. At the end of my shift logging out and gathering all the paperwork from the register/computer and put in fill for the next morning. I enjoyed working at Casey's being a social person. People and acquaintances coming in from time to time to talk or introduce me to potential employees. The hardest part of the job was the overturn of employees. Some people did not like working certain shifts, and would quit in the middle of their shift. Getting someone to fill that position was sometimes hard leaving me to take control and finish out the shift myself."
good,"I enjoyed working with the employees and customers, The customers for the most part were friendly and fun."
good,"Handling money working with the public , friendly place to work ."
good,I enjoy working there I just need more hours. The company is a good place and fun to work the manager I have is excellent.
good,"I would first check to see what has or has not been finished also checking to see what staff is available to me and what their capabilities are, assigning appropriate person to task. Making sure our store maintains the high level of customer service we expect at Caseys."
good,"The hours here of course where alway different parts of the day, and sometimes lasted over 10 hours a day. I got to help customers and deal with money. I worked here for 5 and a half years and I moved myself up the latter and became a assistant manager so I gained more responsibility with the money and the store. I would have to do store books, train new employees that were hired, and order product for the store."
good,"Made donuts, pizzas, and sandwiches. Dealt with customers and co-workers. Manager was a good boss. Co-workers were decent. Hardest part of the job was being there at 4am. Enjoyed the fact I would be able to clock out at 11am."
good,"Very friendly staff and customers. You typically work the register one day, then the kitchen the next where you will prepare pizzas, donuts if you are on night shift, and other various orders."
good,I enjoyed working here alot but the management wasn't very strong so it became pretty stress full. I went through two managers and one area manager in the two years I worked there. You will also get to meet great customers and get to know them well and it was a good place to make friends but with the understanding work comes first then friends later.
good,Stand at a register all day and you do not get breaks unless you smoke and take a smoke break. Overall the customers that come in you sort of build up a relationship with them and the work is not hard at all. But the thing that sucks is the pay and you dont really have room for advancement at Casey's.
good,"My typical day at work consisted of working alone, running a register, and helping customers. I learned a lot about customer service and product placement. I had many managers during my three year span working at the gas station. The hardest part of the job was watching to make sure none of the customers were stealing merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet a lot of different interesting people."
good,"While with Casey's I have learned a lot. People skills probably being first and foremost the most important of the skills I have learned. How to associate with others, how to keep most customers happy, most of the time."
good,"I worked 4pm to 11pm performing cashiering duties, cleaning and more. I learned the definition of hard work with this company. The management was sketchy but the coworkers were great considering I went to school with most of them because it was a small town convenience store and everyone knew eachother. The hardest part was working until 11pm or later on school nights and the most enjoyable part was conversing with the locals that came in."
good,"Fun place to work, friendly staff, all got along pretty decently. Hours are not bad, can't really get full time though. Pay is passable for the work you do."
good,Very hard for anyone wanting full time and lacks a lot of communication in the company about expectations or goals. Seems to be alot of problems between workers and no management trying to help resolve issues
good,Good company to work for. Application process was a bit difficult they lost mine several times and I had to keep applying just for them to be able to access it for my interview.
good,"My job is different everyday, but I enjoy learning different ways to accomplish the jobs that are expected out of me. The benefits are great, the hours are a little rough."
good,I worked with wonderful people. They took pride in our work. I liked being able to work at the register and then the kitchen. Our manager is understanding about in problems and help to solve then anytime.
good,"Management great, equal opportunity not as much as I thought,good hours decent pay. Good work environment most of the time. Not fair on advancement but overall a good place to work a lot of fun"
good,I started off really like the job and the people there was very relaxed and just a good vibe everyday then soon changed when gossipe started bewtween employee and mangers
good,I enjoyed working with the variety of customers. Flexible working schedule. Lots of variety each day. I am a people person so this job was always interesting.
good,"If you can handle people well, (both nice and the jerks of this world) Casey's is a great place to work. It's a fun fast paced work environment. There is always something to do so if you are the type that doesn't like to do much look elsewhere. But if you can roll up your sleeves and dont mind earning your paycheck its good"
good,Loved the people and the oppurtunity to work and excel. The hardest part was the customer service aspect and thinking on your feet to appease customers.
good,It's a good place to work if everyonr shows up and does there job. Store manager is fair and flexible. If you like retail and work well with the public the Casey's is the best I have worked at. Great benefits and vacation and sick leave
good,Working at Casey’s General Store gives you a sense of pride to be part of a team. Every employee works together to make the day a SUCCESS! Providing customers with food and service.
good,I love working at Casey's. I have grown in my management skills. The management cares about me as a person. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a smiley face of a customer as I present them their perfect order.
good,Dealing with hiring and employees personality and making sure people work or stay is just way too much for me to deal with. People don't seem to care about other people.
good,Needs new Management. Needs to have set breaks. Needs to keep a person in the loop on their schedule. Other then those type of negatives its a fun fast paced place to work.
good,"Store manager went to bat for all of us to have a pay raise across the board to stay competitive with local businesses. However if you show them what you're capable of, they tend to run with that. No equality in how in store management had time off which was frustrating. Some cleanliness standards were questionable. Overall decent enough place to work for with decent compensation with room to advance."
good,You get to meet a lot of interesting people working there. The atmosphere is lively. The work there is not that hard to do so it was easy money. Wouldn't recommend if you dont like customer service.
good,I worked at Ogden Casey's General Store for about a year and it was a nice place to work. The store manager was awesome and laid back as long as you did your job well and correctly. The staff was fun to be around as well. Customers who came into Ogden Casey's were usually very friendly.
good,****i dont remember a whole lot. I cant believe they are making me do reviews. I dont do that. I dont what u want to here. I hate to work but i do it bc i have to
good,"Management is very good and understanding in situations and can be a very fun place to work if you have the right crew/team. Dealing with difficult customers can sometimes be challenging, but other than that working there is fun."
good,It's a easy and fun place to work if you like people. But the pay is just not enough to make a living. Hours are inconsistent. They honestly should pay a little bit more for all the things you do at Casey's. There is a lot of extra side work that needs done every day.
good,There's always something to do so there is little time for standing around or sitting. This job is very physical so be ready to work hard and always greet everyone who comes in the door.
good,I dont really want to type anythinG but since i have to i guess ill say that caseys is best as a part time job better highschoolers more than adults looking for a full time
good,Learned that their is always room for improvement. The hardest part of the job was no set schedule. Getting to see the customers smiling face was the best part of the job.
good,"It is a great environment for a real first time job if you are tired of fast food, it is easy and everyone are very fun to get along with. But management is not the greatest nor are the benefits"
good,I got pizza prepared and I made sub sandwiches. I made each order just how the customer wanted it. I had to clean the kitchen and the freezers. I always made sure my customer was happy with their meal
good,It was a great work place i loved it there. It can be fast place and slow  at times. the one i worked at celeabrated some holidays together. But feel like i was mistreated from high up area do to another employee and the situation that happen.
good,My job at Casey's can be stressful depending on many different circumstances.  Overall it is a pretty great job.  Casey's provides very good benefits. As long as the store is properly staffed it is a great job to have.
good,"Casey's General store offered me a wonderful opportunity by starting in the kitchen making pizza and sub sand to Assist manager in 9 months. I was very happy at Casey's. I had to move, and wasn't able in Arkansas"
good,This job is good when you need some extra cash. Would recommend to someone who is in high school. There aren't many advancement opportunities and the pay is usually low. Part-time is barely a gas money job.
good,Like most jobs it usually depends on the fellow co-workers as to how well you enjoy your job. Most customers are friendly and are just wanting to get in and out as fast as possible. Learn to deal with difficult situations and customer complaints.  Management is knowledgeable and fare.
good,"The job is not the best, but not the worst.  The job can get mundane, co-workers make or break the experience.  Can get intense on Friday and Saturday nights when the store is very busy."
good,"your day goes fast, if you are a store manager expect to work 50hrs or more a week. I learned good interviewing skills. Training employees to do the best they can at everything they do was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,The other employees are nice and friendly. The manager makes sure thing are getting done and doesnt just shake it off if you tell them someone is doing something wrong.
good,"This place was not a bad place to work, I had a awsome crew. We were like family, This place was busy, lotto, pizza, gas, smokes, food, stocking, cooking, phones, deliveries, cleaning, on top of that you had to squeeze in a break when you could. There is no set break times, but it was fun."
good,"Working at Casey's is a decent first job experience, it's relaxed and the people are good to work with. Some customers can be rough to deal with but the job and the people even it out. It's good for those who are looking for a job to work during school or who are in between jobs and just need to bring in enough money to get by on."
good,My manager walked out on me and I successfully managed the store on my own for 3 months until they decided to promote a part time pizza maker over me for store manager.
good,Really enjoyed working in Vinton. People in Vinton are awesome. Nice work environment. Worked 2 shift and liked the fast pace. Management was well versed.  Enjoyable all the way around.
good,"Loved that I learned do nut, pizza, and cashier work. Then I learned how to be a great assistant manager from a great boss. Also I was sent to other stores to help out."
good,"I started out at a small Casey's in Beacon Iowa. The store has long since closed. If i would have stayed with company i would be celebrating my 10th year with them. I enjoyed the simplicity of the job: I knew exactly what i needed to do every day Once the routine was established i could have people assist me and they would also know exactly what i needed done and where things were to be found to make my job easier and to make the shift flow smoothly. My managers were all amazing and were always quick to help with what ever i needed. If something needed fixed Corporate was always very quick to send someone down to take care of the issue.  The hardest part of my job was the fact that Casey's was one of the few food places in town (Leon Iowa is a very small community and Casey's is the HUB of it) We averaged 70 carry out pizzas a night. and it would be more if the school needed something for a special event like PROM. We did close to 60 pizzas just for that one event and still had to keep up with the warmers and the regular flow of customers. Fun times. "
good,Worked around my dr appointments and flexible work schedule. I liked to work with public and you could transfer almost anywhere in country if you wanted to.
good,"A typical day working at Casey's is that you would go in and check to see if the pizza for the warmer is ready to be changed out. The employee from the shift before would leave the prepared crusts for the next shift. If they didn't leave any crusts for the next person, then the person for that shift has to make crusts before they can make any pizza. Throughout the entire shift it is a constant battle of keeping up with having crusts made. We would also have to make other food items if nobody wants pizza. We would also have to make cookies and pack some of the desserts into little cups, for examplex we would have brownie bites that would be put into the cups."
good,You  can not work with family! It can ruin a relationship. I loved working but if you learn slower I would not work at Casey's General Store as I was made fun of for learning slow.
good,Caseys is a job that filled a position in their store. I was employed full-time for 40+ hours a week with optional healthcare benifits. Theres not much else to say
good,"My location had an amazing manager however the rest of the co-workers made things difficult as they would have opposing views on how the store should be run, this ended up affecting my side of the store and aggravated me as they would simply do as they please. besides that problem which was fixed as I left everything else was wonderful."
good,"My day starts at 2:30, I open the store and prepare the kitchen for the morning cooks, and then I make the coffee, and set up the soda machines."
good,"Fair pay, still under the cost of living. My local management was okay. Upper management and the overall business model was not the greatest though, and it attracted a lot of negative customers. I would recommend it to someone needing a job and job experience."
good,It is like a giant family with great benefits and perks! I loved it here and only quit due to poor management choices at the time but love the company itself and my co workers!
good,"Every day I am stocking almost everything, cleaning everything, helping customers, and closing the store down. I handle money by giving the correct change to customers."
good,"Not too much to say. It is a good company, but like any place an inept manager can ruin the experience. I would recommend this as a decent starting job."
good,"I have enjoyed working for Caseys General Stores. They have helped me grow as a person and a leader.           They have been patient as I grew with the company. "
good,Casey's worked well with me and made sure that I knew what needed to be done and let me know if I was doing anything wrong but towards the end it was repetitive.
good,"A typical day at work is relatively simple."
good,"I enjoyed working at Casey's. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and getting to know the ""regulars"" that would come in more frequently. I also enjoyed the challenges that I was presented with when  I worked in the kitchen making pizzas or sub sandwiches."
good,Could have been a better position with a better team of employees previous management hired people as friends and didn’t treat them as co-workers! Other than that not a bad job
good,"Enjoyed working with good people and the customers were always friendly and a joy to serve."
good,Just need better hours and 40hrs a week I don't feel 35 is full time but they say it is and will work overtime if needed not afraid of hard work I need the money
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone, it was a very friendly environment to be working in. It could get a little bit crazy/hectic at times but we would all come together as a team and get the job done."
good,The employees I became friends with. Some of the problems with Casey's is that food service has to clean the bathrooms and we work around food . We can't keep people because of the hours and you have to work every holiday.
good,I really enjoyed coming into work. We all worked as a team and helped one another out. The employees were always cheerful and if I needed a day or two off to handle personal issues they understood.
good,"I always enjoyed going into work everyday,always took extra shifts when need if u like customer services much as i do and dealing with the public Casey's is a great place to work."
good,Life and work balance was not an option. I was on call all of the time and I became too much.  I had no time for my family and was expected to work 4-midnights every day
good,Its a good starting job. It is fast paced and u have to always be friendly. Managment is okay. Raises once a year. Always having to deal with rude customers
good,I needed some extra cash so since I had a lot of management experience decided to work at Caseys part-time as I fit in very well.  Due to having a full-time job they have been extremely flexible with me and accommodating.
good,It was a simple job. Basic cashier duties. I looked forward to seeing my regular customers daily. The employees were very friendly and are always willing to help me out when needed.
good,The people i worked with were nice and understanding about me being pregnant and have a 4 year old at home. Would have went back after maternity leave but moved back to Omaha.
good,Caseys offers good pay and benefits The work life balance can be tricky but that comes with management.You .can work your way up as they do promote from within.
good,At Casey's I worked over night and had 3 children at home.   I actually enjoyed the job a lot but was hoping for different hours eventually.  The people were great to work with and I didn't mind the work at all.
good,Liked the hors available to me and the general workplace atmosphere. However the manger was quite unprofessional and made working there quite difficult
good,"As a manager, I did the daily bookwork including counting money, audits, and vendor accounts.  Working with the public is so fun and working with great people helps too."
good,When I joined the Casey's team I was going through alot in my personal life and my job helped me out. My manager understood what I was going through and as a while we all had each other's backs.
good,I loved getting to see & visit with the customers. Didn't get very many hours so I had to quit. Dawn the manager was very good to work for. I enjoyed working with her.
good,"A typical day at work is fast-paced and requires organization and time management skills, as well as a high level of communication skills. The ability to work well with others is a necessity."
good,Awesome Employees Good place to start out and work for years to come becuase everyone needs fuel and food good atmoshere and discounts are alright as long as you are working
good,The job was great it was fast but there were lax times I was required to help unload the stock truck a time consuming process but I was never alone in doing so and if I'm going to be honest there are many worse places you could work.
good,"I have  for worked at Casey's for 16 years now and worked all aspects of the Store in Abilene, KS.  I am the current Manager of the store.  It is a fast growing company and a good company to work for, they are very family orientated company."
good,"Overall a decent part time job. Would have liked to have been offered Full time status before new company changes were executed. Typical days at work include but are not limited to helping all customers with finding items, checking out, and helping the kitchen answer the phone. Best part of my shifts were all the friendly faces you see daily, everyone knows everyone at Casey's."
good,I enjoyed my job at Casey's a lot. I never dreaded going to work. The employees are very kind and get along very well. Pay was decent. Management wasnt the best. Biggest downfall for this job was that the employees would go out together to take smoke breaks every 30-40 minutes. Which would leave one one or two of us to run the store alone until they returned. They do their best to work around your home life.
good,"Friendly place to work, u get to meet so many different people on daily, learn to make pizza and donuts from scratch and company pot lucks, break not that long but your shift go by pretty fast it's constantly busy"
good,I love my job and my boss was the best but he got fired and now I'm mad cause he was the OG and he ran the best store in the nation so screw caseys now cause R was a great guy.
good,Managers care about employees while also providing constructive criticism. However too lenient on some employees who do not do their job. some employees will sit down and play on their phone or watch tv the entire shift.
good,Casey's General Store is a company that is all about furthering your employment opportunities. Such as getting a raise or moving up to management positions. They have a Great atmosphere for team effort and an outstanding line of representative and store owners.
good,for the most part working at caseys isnt a bad place to work. Pretty much everyone gets along. We just like to have fun at work. Joke around you know the usual work environment
good,This is a great place to work if you like people and pizza. The management team is nice and respective. I would recommend people to buy pizza there. And it is a great place to work.
good,"Very good to their employees. Don't discriminate, and also offers good benefits. The management is almost always respectable  great first job for someone looking to get themselves into working full time"
good,"The job is easy enough, so long as you know how to do a job. The management there is really laid back which allows a work-at-your-own-pace mentality. While that can be nice for some, it makes it a bit more difficult for someone who does work, because it means that they're picking up any and all other jobs to pick up the slack."
good,"The people here are very nice and understand about being sick, but they don't understand that even with medication  a special need can not be kept under control all the time."
good,"A typical day at work at Casey's General Store starts out with prep - cutting up fresh vegetables making dough and cheese as needed and straightening the kitchen. Once the busy hours start we focus on making the pizzas quickly and on time. By the end of the night we wrap things up by cleaning the kitchen spotless, making sure we stock the cooler doors, and have everything in order for the next shift. Hardest part of the job was the stress during busy hours but you're always with your team and working together gets you through the night successfully."
good,For my first job working in the kitchen was not that bad but I could have had better training. I enjoyed my time while I was there and the co-workers were great too. They answered some questions when I was on the job while the manager was there during my shift.
good,Quick paced environment with helpful management that strive to teach you and help you understand your role in the work place and help remind you to keep a positive attitude
good,"I worked mainly in the sub sandwich kitchen. I really enjoyed it. I spent most of my day working alone and steadily busy. Of course there are times when you get slammed with customers and someone will come and help if they can. My store manager was wonderful, the next-in-line was NOT. The overall morale is good, and Casey's customers are, I swear, the best & most polite in the world. The worst part of the job is unloading the store-truck deliveries because it;s heavy, fast, and takes half the day. The worst part is that each store only has a certain amount designated for payroll so they have VERY FEW full-time employees, and they only pay minimum wage."
good,"Truly loved working with the great men and women of Casey's. My only issue were the unsteady work schedule the job would sometimes face. Was hard to keep life and work separated. Besides that, it was very professional and has great job opportunities and growth."
good,Enjoyed being able to provide early morning food and refreshments. Loved working solo and the opportunities that presented themselves due to a smaller workplace and eatery. Built strong ties with co-workers and customers. My skills were requested and desired by a select group of individuals.
good,While working at Casey's I worked in the kitchen making both pizza and sandwiches.  I worked several different shifts through my 9 months of employment there.  I worked with a good manager and was blessed with a few hardworking co-workers.
good,it can be a fun place to work. it can also be a bad one. at the store i worked at there were several people would call off forcing others to pick up the shifts.
good,"Being a diabetic, it's very important for us to each 3 meals a day and Caseys General Store does not offer you a 30 minute break. I think if an employee has a health issue such as diabetes they should be allowed to take a 15 minute break."
good,"Typical day of work would most likely not be busy as long as you have help, I love the job but the worst part of it would be the management. Most people I worked with would not come to work so either they had to call people in or you would be left alone. Fast working place, but fun. Amazing people, customers were always nice and fine hours for me."
good,Quick advancement. Fast paced  fun enviroment. Seeing daily customers were enjoyable. Learned alot during employment. Experience able to follow to other employment.
good,"A typical day was preparing food, cash handling, customer service, stocking, and cleaning. I learned how to work the lottery machine and how to make pizzas and donuts."
good,"I did everything from Cashiering,  to daily book Audits,  lottery and lotto sales,  invoices from venders and payouts.  I was in charge of all the hiring and training that needed to be done.  I was in charge of 18 employees and I had three assistants under my watch."
good,"Job was easy and I found it fun. I got along with most everyone there. "
good,"Enjoyed working at Casey's.  They did provide some insurance packages.  Hours could be flexible.  My manager was the greatest.  If you came to work and did your job , helped fellow Co workers you would have a great day."
good,caseys was fun and the coworkers were cool to i had to make pizzas and other food products i had to clean the kitchen and make warmer pizzas every hour i had to unloa the truck and store the merchandise in the cooler
good,"I moved up to first assistant manager in the matter of a year. Fun work enviornment, and management listens if you approach them properly. There are lots of hours available for full-time employees if you're willing to take them. Be prepared to move if you want to continue to climb the corporate ladder."
good,Managment was very great to work for.  Co workers were very helpful and helped when needed.It was close to my home. My hours fit my schedule.
good,It was a nice place to work. But the main manager Becky slacked off to much then complained others were not picking up her slack when she was the only full time employee with better pay
good,I liked working at Caseys General Store . My co workers were very friendly and I wish I still worked there. When I worked here I got raises every three months. i dont really care for the management.
good,"Casey's is a nice, productive place to work. I always feel welcomed by my managers, which helps me start my day. Wheather you work in the kitchen or on the counter everyone is busy and willing to help each other with their duties."
good,"Great company to work for, hard workers, great team work, decent benefits, overall pretty good company.  They like to promote Within the company before going outside of the company."
good,"Caseys is a place where you deal with every kind of person whether it's dealing with a customer or an employee, It gives you the chance to see where you want to be in life whether you want to own your own Caseys or reach for other goals outside of Caseys"
good,"The right people in the right store makes all the difference; thought when I first started everything was challenging. A new store with new people who were all on edge over their new manager that can be a lot for anyone, but after getting to know your regulars and coworkers everything was great."
good,"It is fast paced which I enjoy, and you get to know a lot about the individuals within the community. I've learned a lot about the technological aspects of the cashier and pump systems which were interesting. I mainly work in the kitchen which is wonderful."
good,"Working at Casey's as helped further my management and customer service skill greatly, I've been very appreciative to have the opportunity  to work there and to know the team."
good,"Working with the staff here was enjoyable for the most part.  Co-workers didn't really give me a hard time.  The job was simple and no-nonsense.  Guidelines were easy to follow."
good,"Making donuts, breakfast sandwiches and  Pizza restocking for the next shift. Helping customers. cleaning of all he equipment. taking orders over the phone"
good,"They focus a lot on training and customer service."
good,Enjoyed the work and people greatly. Fun learning experience. Really had fun watching the customers and how they interact with each other.
good,"Its a clean, organized, and fun place to work at. Theres always something new to learn/ challenge. Easy to develop friendships with customers and employees."
good,"You must be on your toes at all times, at the register and in the kitchen. Good place to work, co workers that you can easily get along with"
good,I make sure we always have plenty of product for customers to purchase. I started with the company as a part-time employee and moved up the company ladder in 5 short years. I had a lot of things to learn as a manager.
good,"My typical day of work consisted of stocking cigarettes in the cigarette case, brewing coffee for the customers, keeping all counters clean, front facing grocery shelves and beverage cooler, filling ""fast food"" areas and checking their expiration dates, run the cash register, clean gas pumps, and build any advertising displays for the store."
good,I liked opening rather than closing. Opening with the regulars in the morning was my favorite time of the work day. Making unlimited amounts of coffee and stocking donuts was a good time to me.. It was a great job. I coached soccer and was taking tax classes and they worked around my hectic schedule to assure me the hours I needed.
good,"Greet customers, stocked, open and close drawer counts. Safe drops. Maintain clean and orderly check out area. Stocked condiments, front-faced coolers."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart, mainly because I learned new things literally everyday. Although, I had a set position I was moved around to several different departments to assist my co-workers, which I enjoyed and learned so much more."
good,"The job isn't physically demanding, but the job can be very stressful and mentally strenuous. A typical day of work consists of cleaning, stocking, and making sure the customer has a pleasant experience while at Casey's. Sometimes, trying to implement a pleasant experience for the customer tests the boundaries between good customer service and self control of one's self. Many customers are rude and impatient. When in the kitchen, one person has to make pizza (all from scratch), take orders (both walk-in and cal-in), prep food for the case, clean, make dough, make subs if the sub person isn't around, sweep and mop, and the list goes on. The best part of the job are the co-workers. The people who work at Casey's in Jasonville make a day at work well worth it. Also,  unloading the truck and organizing all the product happens to make one feel very accomplished"
good,"kitchen staff is to be able to work on all stations. Employees work well together and get along. most nights it is fast paced through out the whole shift, leaves minimal time to restock and clean up work space for the next shift."
good,"Mostly just a lot of cleaning, stocking, and cashiering. With being an assistant manager, I had other duties including bookwork, inventory and ordering."
good,"Fairly low stress job, you know what is expected of you. Worked the 3-11 shift and took a higher paid job."
good,"Cashier, Clean, Check Gas pumps, NE Lottery Sales, Movie Rentals, Inventory restocking, Unload delivery truck, Take pizza and sub food orders."
good,"Caseys was a great place to work. Management was fair and we all worked together as a team. If there was ever a problem, we worked quickly to disolve it"
good,"come in at 3am and bake donuts. Opener came in at 6m and than I would start on books and getting deposit ready, ordered gas and merchandise. Ran register until it was time to make pizzas, did that till next pizza person came in at 4. went back to register and in between customers, I cleaned shelves and put up any leftover stock. My shift usually ended at midnight and would be back in at 3am the next day."
good,a good learning experience and learned how to prepare donuts
good,"Started day with bookkeeping I worked as a cashier and did employee supervision,ordering of supplies,helped with pizza and donut making,and cleaned where it was needed."
good,"I had a really tough time working at Casey's because it didn't feel like we were given enough people to work with us. However, I feel I met those challenges and did the best that I could and I feel that it has made me a much harder worker. On the weekends, we would get maybe three or four people working, two in the front and two in the back, but only until around 7pm and then they'll leave and it'll just be one in the kitchen and another on the cash register. My co-workers and managers were great and we took things in stride. We had a set schedule every night and we'd try our best to meet our goals every night. The most enjoyable part of that job was that I got to meet a lot of people and even have regulars. A lot of people could compliment my pizzas or my sandwiches too. "
good,drove my personal vehicle around to deliver pizza to my customers. Learned my area i live in a little better. My manager at time was a little hard on me but i stuck with him and that company till i had no other choice but to leave due to money situations. I loved my co-workers! I got along great with everyone. Hardest part of my job was leaving my son to come to work. Most enjoyable part of my job was i got to meet new people and work with amazing customers.
good,"8 to 9 hour workday. Did bookkeeping,employee supervision, cashier, pizza and donut maker, ordering of supplies,cleaning duties."
good,I was a cashier and a cook. This was a part time job and most evening I would help out on holidays
good,"I loved coming to work here. It was always fun, exciting, There were some bad days but who doesnt have those? I would love to work for this company again."
good,the typical day make food and stock fridge i learned how to make pizza's dougnuts and other stuff not to mention food safety co-workers was fun to be around and to do the jobs with nothing hard about the job
good,Love working so close 2 home. Just lost our district mgr so hopefully things will b better. Have a great group of employees that I work with. Love my customers.
good,"Wonderful place to work, friendly management and customers. Variety of things to learn and do. A great and reliable team who work together and assist one another to get their work done."
good,I liked working here I had amazing customers who appreciated me and hated to see me go they were loyal to me and the company I love working with people
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Casey's. It's amazing how you bond with regulars, and the time seems to fly by as you go about your duties. The only downside is that the pay is on the low side."
good,"This company is pretty good in my opinion. It’s a decent job just starting off out of high school without going to college. The management is often friendly, and the work itself is pretty easy."
good,This was one of my more layed backed easy jobs. Managers were good and most of my co workers were pleasant to be around as well. One of my favorite jobs.
good,"An excellent job if you love a fast paced environment, very fair with time off and understanding you have a life outside of work. Coworkers really came together when someone needed help."
good,You walk in say hello to your fellow employees then get to work. The managers are nice. I learned you have to mix dough at certain temperature for the pizza crust to come out right. the hardest part of the job is to get through the slow UN-busy days.
good,Its a good introduction job. Management is alright and the job is extremely repetitive. The store is clean enough and everyone does their job. The employees are fun.
good,"Casey's allowed me to expand my customer service and problem solving skills. It provided a fast paced, strong team environment. i enjoyed my time at Casey's and left due to relocating back to Columbus"
good,"Currently working here. Here's a few things I have observed since I started. The kitchen is almost always short staffed. On top of making pizza and food for the warmers or orders. You also have a cleaning list to completed each shift, on top of all dishes. I wish more people would appreciate the time you put into large pizza orders and tip the kitchen.  Coworkers mostly helpful. Seems to be a little favoritism at my store. One particular girl the manager seems to bend over for and give her whatever she wants. Its frustrating and driving employees away. Regulars are nice. Company is SLOW at getting things fixed or replaced. Can be frustrating when customers ask everyday when this or that is getting fixed and I have no answer for them. Have had a problem with our pumps for months and it's making some regulars go elsewhere."
good,Too many people wanting a job but nobody willing to do the work needed. Must Work every weekend. Pay is not very well for everything that needs to be done.
good,Good experience  looking for something  different. Made lots of friends. And loved working with different  people. Like to stay busy. And meeting new people.
good,"It was a fast-paced, enjoyable experience. I learned how to manage my time and work in a very hectic environment. The people were amazing and welcoming."
good,"It was a typically calm, non-stressful, and very enjoyable environment. It made it easier to be excited about going to work. I would clean and stock what needed to be done throughout the night. When starting out the first few months I worked roughly 6-7 days a week from 10pm to 7 sometimes 8am."
good,"excellent schedule."
good,"Either worked as a regular employee or did the office work for the manager. Could be on register one day, and in the kitchen the next. Opportunity to cross train for both areas. Enjoyed working in the office doing books and other manager duties. Didn't like working in the kitchen but that was my preference. The worst part was covering call offs."
good,Basic customer service skills. Multi-tasking. Management team worked well together. I gained a lot of my skill from working with Casey's. Overall Casey's was a good place to work.
good,"With the Casey's I originally worked at, I absolutely loved the job mainly because of the work times, the people I worked with in the kitchen, and the people I would meet through the door or on delivery. The workplace culture was very family oriented and was also very understanding of situations like family death, or sickness. These Casey's Stores do not like people who make excuses to not work their shift/hours that the person wanted."
good,"My experience here has been far better than I ever expected walking into it. For anyone trying to apply, it is worth it for a part time job. You will have flexibility with hours, and a great starting pay for a part time job. The work is a lot, and most of the time you are by yourself, but it isn't that bad. I recommend to anyone starting out or getting back on their feet."
good,Great job as far as convenience stores go! Definitely chance for advancement if you're interested. Many locations so there's always one near you. Awesome place for part time job!
good,Started work as store manager in 2009 then promoted to area supervisor in May of 2012. Also became a regional trainer when the company started this position.
good,the till is very user friendly so it does not take too long for most people to get comfortable with being a cashier. The stores also have a kitchen for people who prefer not to work the register.
good,I liked working there. The store manager tries to work around people schedule and hours or time off. I work for Caseys off and on for about 9 years and the last time I worked there I was the kitchen manager and I liked it.
good,"Fast paced work, good training. Only negative is the lack of communication from management. Free drinks and 50 percent off food while on the clock. Overall decent place to work."
good,"If you enjoy a fast paced environment, meeting new people, it's a good job to have! Plenty of things to do to stay busy. Gives a variety in the day to day basics."
good,Working ten hours with no break was tough. The amount of employee call ins was too much. I did however enjoy most of the customers and my manager. I liked having a to do list rather than going by judgement.
good,Casey's General Store is a fantastic place to start out. While on the clock you receive major discounts on food and drink items in the store. There are no set breaks but that was never a problem as most of the work you do here is low intensity and doesn't require much (if any) physical labor. I would definitely recommend Casey's to anyone looking for a part-time job during highschool.
good,"Casey's is a great place to work, but sometimes it could be over whelming due to unreliable co-workers and being out of stock. I would work there again if I was able to."
good,The coworkers and management are amazing. They help with life/work balance issues and are extremely flexible with work schedules. There is tons of room for career advancement and relocation.
good,Relaxed environment with awesome co-workers. The management goes above and beyond for their employees. I wouldn't even consider leaving if I weren't a single parent.
good,"Prep for Breakfast, lunch and dinner rushes.  cleaned kitchen and stocked product.  Made food to order while maintaining customer relations.  Made food for customer warmers."
good,I really like the people I work with as well as the customers.  I have learned alot and continue to learn daily.  I have worked all the shifts and continue to do so.  Working at Casey's is like a routine.
good,If transfered with in the company there should be a time frame on how long it should take to adjust to the new district. This is a good company to work for but have issues from upper management.
good,This was an awesome place ❤️ to work. My boss was very understanding and was always there for you. The work was stressful at times but as a team it always worked out
good,Working side by side with my team is a positive thing.  Work daily with vendors for deliveries. The management works with several stores and is always willing to help.
good,"a typical day would be working the cash register, stocking coolers, stocking shelves, working in the kitchen occasionally, unloading truck, checking in vendors"
good,"I was the main cook for 2nd shift. I cooked pizzas and other things on the menu, food prep, cleaned and stocked. It's pretty easy going if you can handle the dinner rushes."
good,I already like to clean and organize things but having people there within me make things more fun and less time consuming. With their help things can easily get done. Being the delivery driver is also fun. But my coworkers and manager make it fun to be there.
good,The time i spent at caseys was good. The co workers were nice and easy to get along with. The managment was easy going and respectful. It is a pretty easy going place to work.
good,"Good place to work, fast paced usually.  Many things to always be done and stay busy. Decent manager who is understanding,  but also very judgemental and opinionated.  Also loves to gossip...."
good,"Great job for college, I was able to learn exellent customer service skills while working here. I worked in both the kitchen and as a front cashier clerk. I managed monies, inventory and worked with the public"
good,"Was not fond of senior executive management, one person in particular.  He is no longer at Casey's.  Loved the people and I worked there for a total of 17 years.  My boss was very caring about his employees!"
good,"At times, it didn’t even feel like an actual job because it was so laidback. Working overnights, not many people came in so you really got to know your customers."
good,What i enjoyed the most about working at Casey's was that everyday was challenging but it was really fun meeting new people and helping he/she with their problem and feeling great about it
good,"Manager is amazing"
good,Worked here when they first opend in the town. They have since expanded their hours and are now making their own subs as well as an expanded food selection
good,"caseys is a good company to work for, offering competitive wages, benefits, and a friendly and safe work environment. great company for an entry level position."
good,"It was a fun place to work, co-workers and managers were all great, friendly and willing to  help in any way they could. The required work load was easy to medium depending on the day. Overall the atmosphere was a pleasant place to work."
good,Fast paced but never enough time to get things done.  Got everything done but was stressful.  There was possibility of advancement as they hired more people for the position I was in.
good,"Fun place to work mainly, regular customers and typically set schedules. Company is growing quickly. High turn over due to lack of pay to baseline workers."
good,"In the kitchen at Casey's you will learn to make the famous pizza and you will be responsible for stocking veggies, answering phone calls, making subs, and doing basic clean up in the kitchen. You will also be responsible for warmer food and charts, It is a fun but fast pace environment."
good,It's a good first job. It is really flexible almost too flexible but it helps build a work ethic. Not to mention that my co-workers were great to work with and I really liked how my manager handled the business.
good,I liked the people I worked with and took pride in putting out a good product.  Enjoyed atmosphere and did my best to be a good employee.  They have improved even more from what I've heard and would consider returning.
good,"Show up on time and ready to work and you're golden.  There is a high turnover rate for this reason.  You don't have to express undying loyalty to Casey's but you need to take it seriously."
good,"I worked the night shift, five to midnight. The first few hours were crazy and really hectic. After about eight, when my second cashier would leave, things would slow down. It was a day on constant repeat. The only change was customers. Some days they were kind and understanding, other times they were rude and down right cruel. My manager was kind though, she understood when I needed off and when I needed more hours."
good,"prepping and making food "
good,"Fast-paced environment,  fun to work for, hours are good, customers and coworkers are friendly. Short breaks, sometimes stessful. Overall, I would recommend this job to others. They are good about sick leave and vacation days."
good,"very stressful, a lot of drama, too much to do in a short amount of time, I got experience but not something I want to do for right now at this age and got stressed very easily with the drama."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed the company, and had at least one decent higher up that I would return to work for. However, some management was highly incompetent and asked almost impossible work weeks; i.e. one position was required to work days, nights, and overnights, all in one week, and never set days (So Mon could be overnight, Tues could be day, Wed could be night, etc.). Store managers are required to work 45 hours per week, receive one week paid vacation per year, and could receive quarterly bonuses depending on business profits. Assistant Managers, Food Service Leaders, and Full Time employees were required to work 35 hours per week, one week paid vacation. All employees and management had access to health benefits at differing levels."
good,I really like working there. They worked well with me being in school and working. The work place was nice and everyone was very welcoming. The management was great to work with they where like a second family.  Its a great place to meet new people and some times you can makes somebody's day with a simple smile while working. Everthing is quit easy to learn its a nice place for anyone who has never had a job before.
good,"Like the company,just wasnt allowed to do my job as an assistant manager. The store manager was very controlling and wanted to do it all. Was punished many times for going to supervisor to try and fixed the situation.  I have nothing bad to say about the company unfortunately it was one bad manager that was the downside"
good,Place is very fast paced but fun to work at.place does offer advancement but have to work there long time to advance. Place don't give many breaks or lunches if you get one
good,"Depends on where you go, but management is childish, pay isn't bad if you work your way up per year. Somewhat physically demanding. If you're willing to cross train, you could get more hours."
good,"Casey is a gas station,restaurant that you can work as a gas clerk or a pizza and sub maker in the same week.you can some  benefits but full time employees like manager,assistant manager,and food service leader can get full benefits."
good,"It was a good work place, great co-workers, Have a great store to come to. working a lot of hours,  the management will work with if you need a day off"
good,"System was really easy to learn, staff was decently friendly.  Didn't pay a lot, but didn't really work that hard either. Pretty chill and laid back experience."
good,"Always there on time , loved satisfying customers with orders they put in . Always had a good attitude an got along well with others . Looking for full time , and long term position somewhere ."
good,Casey's was fun &easy to work for Management was alright and the people I worked with were genuine.customers were awesome being in a small town they were nice and considerate.
good,"I would go in as a cashier, and by the end of my shift I was in the kitchen making pizzas. I was there 4 months before I got the opportunity to be kicked up to Assistant II. Which was basically the same thing only now I got to balance books and chart waste and learn donuts. I loved my coworkers and we worked great together."
good,It has its moments I think my experience here was ok not sure if I would recommend. It would all depemd on the person if you would enjoy it me personally did not
good,The people were pretty friendly management was polite and respectful. I never felt belittled. Not good at remembering what days you can not work.pretty rotating staff people constantly quit.
good,"I feel like working here really helped me grow as a customer service representative. It'd been a while since I'd been in a management position so serving as a First Assistant Manager really expanded my view on what I could accomplish within the management field. While I decided it was not quite what I was looking for, I gained valuable experience in this position and would encourage anyone to go for it should they seek the same opportunity."
good,This job required a lot of work that must be done in order to keep the store running. Management did a very good job with working with the employees schedule.
good,"It's a simple job, it doesn't require too much thinking which is good when we get busy. My coworkers are great, they've always helped me out when I've asked for it, they're kind people, absolutely wonderful to work with. I'm able to go back and forth between the kitchen and the sub station."
good,"I worked the morning and afternoon shift in the kitchen.  I learned how to make donuts, pizzas, and hot sandwiches.  I enjoyed the people I worked with, even my boss.  She was fun to be around and was a very competent leader.  The hardest part of the job is the hours.  I typically worked 3 a.m.- 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.-2 p.m. three to four days a week.  Every other week I alternated weekends with a co-worker.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie found among the workers."
good,"Every shift is preparing the best foods for customers to enjoy. Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner. We strived towards making every customer happy but preparing all pizzas for take-out, donuts, cookies, and even subs. We work as a team to get the jobs that needed to be done and we kept it going. As new management is taken into part, nothing changes. We still work hard and at a fast paced environment."
good,The other employees were fair and great workers. Did what were asked of them. I learned about running the cash register. We did not have a store manager. The hardest part of the job was doing most of the work myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with such great people.
good,A typical day at work included excellent customer and customer satisfaction.  I learned to do my job to the best of my ability and not depend on others. Management left a great deal to be desired. Many of my co-workers were young and very lazy. The hardest part of my job was doing my required work as well as the work of others to maintain a nice store. I had respect for the Company.  The  most enjoyable part of my job was happy and satisfied customers.
good,"I loved working with MOST, not all, of the other workers. The management wasn't that bad at all. There could have been better employees hired that actually cared about their job."
good,"I would clock in an immediately start helping customers whether it was in the kitchen or up front at the register. I kept all my areas clean while helping customers or while preparing the customers food order.  I learned how to manage my time while working on multiple tasks at once. Management was fair and was a good mentor. Co-workers for the most part were as fair and helpful as they could be at helping get the job duties done as assigned. One part of the job was complicated, and that was trying to learn management tasks while still keeping my original job duties completed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships I was able to build with my co-workers and even some of the customers."
good,"This is a very interesting place to work. The job is very routine, so it is easy to plan out the whole work day. Management would offer all employees free fountain drinks and free food from the cafe. The customer base was very fun, and we were always encouraged to start conversations with customers. Only two employees would be scheduled at the same time, and they never worked in the same area together. It was always easy to get all of the daily chores done in a timely manner."
good,Great work for students or others that find themselves between jobs. It will keep you busy and there is opportunity to advance.
good,"Supervised eleven stores. Traveled daily across southern Indiana working closely with management and staff to ensure sales goals, company standards, and overall performance is met. I learned employees follow leaders. Management usually started out as a sales associate or assistant manager growing and developing into the role of management. Co-workers always help. The company was a team environment. "
good,"Fun place to work at when you have orders to make"
good,"Get to work and get started, usually during dinner rush."
good,This job is interesting a temp agency where they have various positions dealing with hospitality. I learned to be open minded and have compassion.
good,"Hours could get insane, a good shift depends heavily on the previous shift finishing up their work so that can cause problems. Mostly worked in the kitchen so health and safety issues were stressed immensely. eventually got to the point were expectations were too high for the time allowed to complete tasks."
good,"very busy place and met a lot of people the only thing was the pay, had to make sandwiches besides pizza's  all so made pizza dough besides taking orders and i all so stocked shelf's and cooler's"
good,"I enjoyed my job with Casey's I, also enjoyed being with the public and getting to know my customers on a first name basis. I think that was the best part getting to know my community and being known for the girl who runs the local store.."
good,"When working at Casey's I was ""the pizza girl"". I got along with the customers and the employees like we'd known each other for years. I would come in to work during one of my varying shifts being that I worked part time and start the day by doing what I do best, making food. I would prep up and start cooking right away, and after all that was taking care of I would attend to my cleaning. Sometimes I would also be asked to help out at the register and so i would finish cleaning or stocking whatever I was doing and go help out. The management was very kind and very family like. We knew if we had done something wrong though the management did not allow for fooling around, it was a business after all. The hardest part of the job for me though was trying to communicate in other languages. I know a small amount of Spanish and so i was asked to try to communicate with the Spanish community, that was hard for me though because I've always struggled with any other language when trying to learn it. Also the fear of saying the wrong thing and insulting someone hindered me from speaking fluently. I ended up working a lot of overtime and extra shifts due to people going on vacation, or needing a day off, or sometimes I would end up staying late to help management with registers or stocking the coolers. What I really enjoyed about working at Casey's though was that we were all really good friends there. There never really was any mean gossip or someone not liking another person. It was just a peaceful coexistence, which is very rare to find at some jobs these days."
good,Being a Manager here was very enjoyable. I learned many skills. The employees were phenomenal.
good,"Managing a convenience store is busy job. Finishing your books, deposits, customers, food service. Casey's makes their own donuts, lunches, pizza, and also started pizza delivery. I learned that I was capable of handling many transitions in the store. Including switching to 24 hours, and going to pizza delivery. "
good,"I liked my hours i had (4am-1pm) it make time go by fast.  However didnt like the amount of hours i had to put in at the end of my time working for caseys but, it still was a good experience working for that company."
good,On a daily basis I would clock in start my computer log in and do my reports then I would balance the day before books. i would then put all my paperwork together and then do an inventory on tobacco and log in to the register. I learned a lot about rules regulations scheduling ordering and balancing work and life. my management was very firm and open minded. my co workers were all under my age group and were very cooperative at times Felt like it was a school with to much personal drama being brought to work by others. hardest part of my job was trying to get a repair man on a holiday. Working with my manager was the best part of my job because with her i learned everything to know.
good,"My typical day starts at 4am, where I come in and make the donuts for the day before the stores opens. I am then responsible for making food for the warmers and making sure that there is always food available to our customers. I run the register occasionally for the cashier while they take their break. I end my day at 2pm. I have learned that it takes a lot of teamwork to keep a store running and that without that teamwork, stuff can start to fall apart rather quickly. Both managers I have worked for have been great! They try to keep things fun while keeping things professional. A lot of my co-workers have become my second family. The hardest part of my job is really nothing, except for maybe dealing with employees that expect you to cover their shifts but won't do the same in return. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with the customers and working with people that I consider family."
good,"I would usually get to work early to get a jump start on the day. I learned how to run the cash register and cook things so that it wouldn't take to much of my time during the day. I had plenty of help from my fellow employees, so I learned pretty fast. The hardest thing of my days was running the card machine for the semi truckers. The easiest thing was cooking in the kitchen."
good,"You knew the management break down"
good,"I work 3rd shift, so I do a lot of cleaning. Our management team is very good at what they do. They are very helpful and caring. Most of my co-workers are hard working and amazing to work with. The hardest part of my job is customer satisfaction, though most days that is not an issue. The most enjoyable part of my job, is seeing my customers walk away happy with the services they were provided with in their visit."
good,"Job consists of working either on the store-side or in the kitchen.  The kitchen is responsible for preparing food, completing food orders, and for maintaining kitchen cleanliness.  The store-side is responsible for balancing a cash drawer and safe as well as waiting on customer's in a timely manner, maintaining store cleanliness, and making sure that products are stocked on shelves.  It's a very fast paced environment and an excellent job for people who enjoy working with multiple people in a day."
good,"We've had a great many good people come and go. Manager seems to lie to alot of people to get them to stay as long as he can. But they wise up and quit sooner or later. The company as a whole is great I love the work and my team. The manager however does not treat his people nice. He changes schedules without informing employees and then gets really upset with them when they are late or don't show up; because they did not know of changes. We have lost a great deal of people because of this. The employment ads read: flexable schedules but that all depends on who your store manager is.He avoids safety issues because he's so worried about his budget. He's obsessed with the ""Time"" no-one is scheduled 40 hours but he continues to leave notes daily that we need to clock out 2 minutes or 4 minutes or whatever early. It does NOT make any sense because payroll is always 20 or more hours under budget. We never have enough help during really busy times. Cashiers go an entire shift without a break. There's no one to cover for them. Caseys policy reads that Arkansas is a right to work state therefore do not have to give breaks. The company needs to learn that we are NOT ANIMALS doing their work for them and making their company money; but we are HUMAN! "
good,"my management is great, but it hard to get time off because there arent many employees"
good,A typical can be fast paced but not too bad. Great work environment!
good,"Good work environment, just not enough full time positions available, and not much room for advancement."
good,"the food is wonderful, the workers are polite, the managment is professional"
good,"It was a great company to work for overall.  I just decided that I wanted to look for some more opportunities to advance my career, so I could learn more about the different types of fields to work in."
good,"I like a lot working there, good people very convenient. just lied back chill place my time with them was great just my favorite place to go to work and you will like it tooo"
good,Waiting on customers. Making coffee and helping the customers find whatever they need help finding. Cleaning the floors and making sure everything is stocked.
good,"I worked front line on the cash register, waiting on people wanting things from food to cigarettes and gas.  Selling lottery tickets, stamps and propane gas tanks.   Manager worked with employees scheduling around doctors appointments and other issues."
good,Great opportunity to advance in the company. Great opportunity to improve your customer service skills. Great company to learn food service and making pizza.
good,I've worked with Casey's for a total of 5 years 3 different stores I was assistant manager at 2 of them everything went pretty smoothly good place to work I'm just looking for something better for myself and my family
good,I enjoyed working for this company and my co workers were great and understanding!! We all worked together as a team in everything we did !! Good benefits too! If there's were family emergencies or situations they understood and were concerned for you and would work around the situation.
good,"Cashier, and Prepared Pizza or Donuts, "
good,It was a nice ace to work. Very family oriented. Cared about there employees. Always willing to work with u when it came to needing time off. Loved working for them
good,Would go in at 4pm and start making up pizza orders cutting them then waiting while still working till the person comes in for the order then when closing the kitchen I'd prepare trays of frozen food so the morning shift can use clean up the whole kitchen even the sub making side even when that person doesnt finish there job I'd clean up after making sure the morning shift on that side had everything they need
good,i loved waking up the the morning making donuts and breafest sandwiches. Seeigthesmile on people faces when they came in the that fresh coffee and freash hot donuts.
good,Casey's is continually growing and expanding.  Opportunity for advancement as long as willing to relocate.  The most enjoyable part about the job is working with our customers.
good,"Most gas stations only have a small amount of employees, but Casey's also has a kitchen. If they would always have 3 people staffed at all times, it would be much more manageable for the employee."
good,Good team work and fun Environment good management payed well lots of hours when asked for. The company cares for its employees and has great health benefits and 401k
good,"never a dull moment, its either slow or overwhelmingly busy with food orders, definatly inconcistent hours, you bounce around with working morning and or night shifts"
good,Well not all things are always easy. You just have to follow the rules and make sure you get the job done. There is no slacking when it also comes down to having to mess with money.
good,How to prep and make all diffrent pizza's and and other foods. to have good time management to keep warmers filled and everything running smoothly. And keeping everything clean and organized
good,"In my review it's an overall great place too work but when terminated for conflicting views then put on the non rehirable list but giving others more of a chance that don't deserve it compared too others who do "
good,"Good place to work, decent pay and friendly staff. I enjoyed going to work everyday. The staff was very helpful and trained me well enough so I could train others."
good,It was a fun place to work at for a summer job. I ended up meeting a lot of new people and hear lots of customers stories. I recommend as a temporary job.
good,Early on there were a few issues with old crew and new crew but things came together it is turning into a well oiled machine. Everyone works together.
good,I love being around people. I like to stay busy. There is always something to do clean don’t lean. Clean bathrooms. I did the truck order changed gas prices
good,"It's not a perfect place to work at. But it's better than working at some other places most of the time. The managers are generally good to very good at doing their jobs. It's tough when some co-workers do ""no call & no show"" and make other employees have to stay longer. But that happens at other jobs as well. Depending on the position, the work / life balance can be good."
good,Loved working there its a great start n finish job 2 work over nights at.... I really enjoyed the place people... I learned new things there also.....
good,"I liked working there with my fellow employees, training was good, but I thought it wasn't fair that they wasn't willing to transfer me to a different store due to me having to move on short notice due to a family member was sick and I'll and needed my wife and I help."
good,"It has been a pretty wild ride with Casey's General Store. Ups and Downs. Emotional, but worth it. Great small town style company that really does care about there Customers. If you put together a good staff like our current Store Manager did. It's pretty cool. I have been a Pizza Delivery Driver for 2 years know and really like it overall and make pretty good money surprisingly. I would like to Manage my own store someday."
good,The job is face paced and keeps you on your toes. The work is easy management was awesome and a good place for advancement and starting pay aint to bad
good,The store was a great job bit at times it had its draw backs for example hours would get cut and you may only get twenty hour weeks and another week youay get fourty hour weeks so that fluctuates.
good,"Casey's is a great place to work, overall the staff was super helpful and really positive and helpful when asking questions to things that I need. They had great manager who was very flexible"
good,"I have worked with Casey's part time, 2015 and this is a good honest"
good,I learned how to make pizzas how to make all the other food how to run the register how to take it down and open it up. I learned how to open up the store.
good,I enjoyed my many years of growth with this company. The employees were well rounded and the customers were from all walks of life. It truly made my day to help others even if it was just with a smile
good,I would recommend this business as a first time job or even a career.  The hours are there to work and the pay is decent.  The food is good and as an employee it is half off.
good,Decent place to work if you don't mind feeling the day drag on. Typical day at work is running a register and making coffee along with the given customer service. hardest part of the job is how long the day seems. Easiest part of the job is basically everything.
good,"Must be adapt to constant changes"
good,I had a lot of fun working here. Overall it was a great company to work for! I learned a lot in my short amount of time. If I had to if definitely go work there again.
good,"Very busy in the early morning's until I leave at 10:30 am everyday. Management is wonderful. Don't have any problems while at work.  I go in at 3:00 am and work my 7.5 hours and go home, no problems."
good,This was high energy and fast pace work environment. I kept busy the entire shift.  Didn't have any issues with colleagues.  Schedule was consistent. I would work there again.
good,The people you work with are always really easy to get to know. On weekdays the workplace is not very busy and just relax. Weekends are very busy and the workers get really serious.
good,Usually worked 9 hours shifts in the evening from 3-midnight. Around 5:30-7:30pm were the busiest times because of the rush of traffic from people going home from work. Also tends to be busy during the school sporting seasons.
good,"It is Very convenient with great customer services, and the food is good. It’s good on prices of products and gas,  Caseys prides themselves on being there for the customers and the community."
good,They are good place to work for but when u are a kitchen manager no matter what u had to work if other peoplr didnt my only problem was that everyone called in i worked more then 24 hours at a time it shut me down
good,"I had a wonderful time working for Casey's! I loved seeing the regular customers and the new ones. I very rarely had an issue on the job, and if there was one it was handled well!"
good,They are always understaffed. I have heard management talk bad about employees to other employees. There are a few employees that pick up the slack for the others. I have heard employees self esteem brought up just for it to be torn down the next day.
good,"Bosses are usually pretty accommodating and easy going. Schedule can get crazy and are never set and the work can get difficult, especially while dealing with customers and making pizzas."
good,"This particular store is very good to work for.   The manager is understanding, approachable and will work with the employees.   She has a great personality and cares about her employees.  The only con to this job was the amount of pay.   As an assistant manager, I only made .25 more than the doughnut maker which I felt was very unfair for the responsibilities that were incurred with the job of 1st assistant manager."
good,Overall a good company to work for with flexibility with good training. Staffing was good with giving extra hours if needed. Even if a ride was needed they had no problems assisting.
good,"I enjoyed working here. They worked with my home schedule, it was fast enough time didnt drag on, the work was easy, everyone was easy to get along with."
good,"On the job training for computer use while ringing up customers, locking/unlocking the safe, working in the kitchen, working the lotto machine & scratch off tickets. Very slow paced job as it’s not typically busy your whole 8-hour shift."
good,Good place to get food. The people are friendly they always seem to know you there. Easy access. Bunch of different foods and snacks and drinks. Has things noone else around has.
good,This position works very well with college and allows me to structure my schedule around my classes. I feel the pay is fair. The management is fair. The store is fast paced at times and requires you to be independent and to time manage.
good,I work in the kitchen making pizza - also work in the store on the tills and helping customers -- ordering truck and managing day today things - assist with ordering and unloading truck weekly
good,During my years i spent at caseys general store we went through several managers and i was expected to keep up with the store with no raise of pay to do so i was a assistant manager at 8.60per hour which is terrible for a assistant
good,I would stock shelf. I learn to put thing in the computer in how to manager employee and money. I how to order and keep it stock the store. I enjoy the customer
good,"Many advancement opportunities,   starting pay is good.  Flexible hours.   Great benefits,.  Transfer opportunities. Quality products, known for the great pizza they make."
good,"Typical day at Caseys would be prepping kitchen, and tending t guest when needed. I learned to be quick to the guest. The management was always there for every shift helping the team. The workplace at Casey's was very well respected, it was clean and we tended to have many friendly customers. The hardest part of the job was having multiple orders at once and orders coming through on the phone. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out a guest going above and beyond."
good,I had built very strong friendships and bonds with many of the people I worked with. We we're always willing to let a hand to help each other out when we needed it. We ALWAYS tried to work as a team.
good,"Very fun place to work! Always something to do, management was awesome, very flexible and never a dull moment. Always get to meet new and interesting people coming and going"
good,This job is enjoyable and fast paced.  I love the customers and my managers. The manager works with my schedule and around childcare.  I am well paid.
good,"I worked here twice, my manager was awesome and was like family. My other family members still work for the company and enjoy working, The only thing I didnt like was hours would vary one week you would work one shift and the next it would be a completely different shift."
good,Not a bad company to work for. Fast pace during the day and slower pace during the night. As well as good food and decent pay. Dollar an hour more for over nights
good,"At the store level, Caseys is a great place to work if your looking for flexibility and low stress work(unless your a GM). I would definitely recommend working at Casey's for students or people who have some sort of other obligations in life that take a lot of time. However, corporate management at Casey's appears to have absolutely no regard for the comfort or workplace needs of their store employees/managers. They employ outdated business tactics that are proven to not work and its painfully obvious that they look at their store workers and management as drones or numbers. They open too many stores too close together, then ream store managers for not bringing in enough profit, cut weekly hours, ream store managers again for going over their allotted weekly hours and don't understand why it all keeps going in a circle."
good,"Definitely a good place to work, the manager is nice, honest and straightforward. Your coworkers will help you anytime you need it, even coming from home to work to help out if it’s a busy night. The hours are flexible but the schedule tends to change pretty frequently. The work is hard to learn but easy to do. The toughest part is keeping up with orders. Customers are generally pretty friendly and sometimes chatty which can be a bonus when it’s a slow night or you have most of your work done. The only problem is the pay is pretty low, just $2 over minimum wage, definitely not enough for some of the things you have to deal with. I would stil recommend this place though."
good,"I liked my job at Casey's, I had a nice, caring, and understanding management. Everyone helped each other when things got busy or stressful and you always had someone to talk too."
good,"Good job culture, great people to work with and good hours. I worked a typical Monday through Friday, with the occasional Saturday thrown in there. Time was well spent."
good,Casey's has been the funnest place I've worked at. The managers are pretty flexible with your schedule. You also get half off of the bakery items or items made in the kitchen.
good,Manager that I had when I was there was great. Not a lot of benefits but the customers were good and so were the other employees. Some days were busier than others but it was a small town gas station.
good,good place to work good hours friendly people meeting and training to keep you fresh and up on the changes enjoyed out activities in the community helping out the community
good,"Good company to work for."
good,Casey's general store is and will always be a highly recommend gas station to work at great people to work with and for would highly recommend this job for anyone
good,It was a great place to work and the manager was really understanding about. The co-workers and the customers where always friendly and always made your day.
good,"not the greatest job. typical day includes keeping store cleaned and stocked, running cash register, greeting customers. management is alright. slow relaxed work place, smaller casey's so most of the customer are regulars and very friendly. hardest part of the job is working alone, tends to get a little boring and only so much work you can do in a small store"
good,The quality of this job will greatly depend on the location and the current staff. I was lucky to have a great staff and location. The job is demanding but rewarding.
good,Always fun to go to work. Got along with everyone regardless of age. Never boring. Always different projects to do. Enjoy all the customers and fellow employees.
good,"I enjoyed working there. Friendly staff and patrons,high paced environment. I worked as kitchen staff/stock person here and occasional cashier. Overall it was a good place to work"
good,I enjoy working here just not getting much hours and really enjoy being in the kitchen making pizzas and anwsering the phone but also enjoy the register to make conversation with each customer
good,Loved working for the manager.  Given many opportunities to grow in knowledge of the inner workings of the store and in all areas (not just the cashier).   Great employees and repeat customers made working here a happy experience.
good,Working for Casey's was a good job if you like working in a kitchen or register environment it does keep the bills paid but not by much but livable wage if you're single with no kids
good,"Friendly people, value work-life balance, decent pay. I have been working at Casey's General Stores full-time (Less than a year)"
good,the job is always fast. but always did manage to get the work done on time. decent people to work with the pay isnt bad but not the best. cant complain.
good,I loved working here! I made pizzas so it could get a little stressful at times when we got really busy but the people I worked with didn't mind helping when they could. When we got busy it was really busy and when we was slow we was really slow there was no grey area. When we got slow and we did all the work that we could we would talk and joke around. I loved how they let me cross train for register and do pizzas. It was a great place to work!
good,I can honestly say that working for caseys wasnt a bad experience. I advanced fairly quickly position wise. I made lots of friends. The pay was the downfall.
good,"Enjoyable workplace, fast paced environment shifts move quickly. must be able to multitask on a regular basis. Management was great on the store level as well as regional/district management."
good,Loved working here. Everyone on the team was always so nice and helpful. Manager is always happy to help with any questions you have. Work environment is nice and relaxed when it’s not super busy
good,The hardest part about the job was that it was tedious. I did not mind the work because it kept me busy. Everyone showed up willing to work and help out.
good,A typical day consists of general cleaning and greeting a multitude of people and helping them with their requests. Once a week unloading supply truck and putting away product.
good,"I miss the Midwestern hospitality, management was fair and it was a clean work environment, the only issue is the low minimum wage in this state. It is not enough to survive on"
good,"Relaxed environment with flexible hours, sometimes the work can be fun and the business can range from super busy to dead depending on the time of day"
good,"This is a fun job for anyone with a passion for quick service style food. The lunch rush was crazy at times and challenging to keep up with the warmers, however, there was always a great atmosphere and not a lot of “dreading” going to work."
good,"I arrive early and have the rest of the day to do what I want.  I heat the donuts and then make the ones that we have to maek fresh.  After the donuts are made, I then make pizza and other breakfast foods that are fresh and hot."
good,Loved seeing regulars....it was pretty steady always something to do....good place to work for.....overnights where good slow but was able to get all work done....management was easy to get along with
good,Great place to start a career. 4 day work weeks between Sunday and Friday. The cafeteria food is great and there is also a day care. Great benefits with a 401k and stock options.
good,If you are in search of a start up job Casey's is a great place. Working at casey's is not too challenging but also not too simple. It is fun and easy going. It is a friendly environment and I would love working there again.
good,"When i was a cashier i would check people out. sweep, make coffee, refill cups and lids, stock the cooler. when i was a cook i would clean, make dough, make pizza, sandwiches, etc."
good,"Overall this was a fun job, all employees are nice, there can be a rush as a cashier but nothing that cannot be handled. Sometimes there are rude customers so you have to know how to not take it personal. The one thing that I did not like was taking out the outside garbage when you are the only cashier there, you have to find time throughout the day every shift to very quickly get it done before a customer comes in. Also there were no designated breaks. You would just have to find a time that you can get away but still keep watch for customers. there is down time though so its not too hard. also the regulars are nice once you get to know them."
good,"A typical day at work was opening at 5am.  Making coffee, stocking, cleaning rest rooms.  I learned how to manage money, communication skills, I met so many nice people.  Very nice coworkers."
good,It was a productive place to work very flexible with you’re schedule. Good customer service. Relaxed placed not to uptight . Good management and workers
good,The company didn't care about their employees. Under paid and over worked for the busy that they brought in. Quality of products could be better. It was horrible though.
good,I loved working with my different crew members they were pretty good to work with and working with and meeting all the different customers I worked there three years and enjoyed doing my job the best I could and really appreciated the help I got when my mom passed away the manager helped me as much as  they could it was a good place to work
good,"Very organized day,Learned new recipes.Very fun and positive atmosphere.Loved all my coworkers and the community.The management was always very upbeat and positive."
good,they do their best at customer service. they employee great people that want to do their best to further the company. They only start off at minimum wage but the longer you stay the more they reward you.
good,Most enjoyable part was my employees and customers. The hardest part of my job was lack of respect from District Manager. Loved learning new tasks and abilities from my Area Supervisor.
good,New Management should not be in the position. Employees should not be allowed to view applications for other stores submitted. High turn over rate. Some employees are friendly others not so much.
good,Casey is an amazing place to work with career opportunities if desired. Working there was a great way to get involved with the community as well. They always strived to accommodate every employee and customer.
good,The work was never too hard as long as you did what you were asked to do and you did it to standards by sop you were clean and courteous and kind to customers it's best if you're not a slob and you take pride in the way you look and try to be a tidy person
good,I started as an assistant manager and went quickly to manager. Was transferred 3 times in my time there to solve problems at other stores. Overall experience was good and I consider it a good place to work.
good,you get to meet and greet lots of new and old people. you must be able to work fasted in order to check the customers out and multi task while stocking
good,"i cooked pizza, made sandwiches, salads, bread sticks, chicken wings. i cleaned and sanitized the kitchen and the dishes. i took the trash out and prepped for the night shift."
good,"It's just like any other gas station it has its pros and cons, one was that unless you smoked you didn't get any breaks but it does pay well for the most part and the environment was nice"

good,they helped you out all the time if you needed it. the people were friendly and nice to you. they worked with you on your hours and kids being sick. you helped each other out.
good,Days are slow-paced with the exceptional truck day which is more busy than other days. Management lacks proper leadership skills. The workplace is relaxed and easy to manage.
good,Every day was a good day. as a team everyone done their part. I learned to be the solution to the needs of the people. The best part of the day is when we are busy but organiuzed to handle the load.

good,It was my first job so everything was new to me but they were really patient and very informative. I learned alot from that job. I would say it was a good company to work for.

good,not a bad place to work. love the people that work there. I like cooking and love to sever food.......................................................
good,"One of the best places to buy homemade pizza. I did a lot of the book work and did scheduling and made sure things where ordered, I made sure every shift was also covered"
good,its a good place to work...lots of interaction with co workers and customers...get to do different job duties so doesn't seem like youre doing the same thing every day
good,Learned team work and gained experience in different departments. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working for a company that maintains a repeatable brand.
good,Laid back environment.   Good customer service.  Good company to work for.  Potential to move up in the company.   Friendly customers  potential to work in kitchen or cashier.
good,I enjoyed working for Caseys it was a lot of fun and enjoyed going to work. I believe I would still be employed if I hadn't made a careless mistake of my part. I did however right a wrong but was not allowed to stay. Given the opportunity I would work for this company again.

good,"I enjoyed working here, alot of people come in and out throughout the day. It is always nice meeting new people. Very friendly and flexible management."
good,Good company to get a job. You get paid every two weeks and you can choose from direct deposit or use a Visa pay card. Each two week period has different hours.
good,"The people were nice, was great working with the kids, played alot, cleaned a lot, learned about the kids, was in the kid zone pretty self explanatory."
good,it seems that the harder you work it is never good enough. I put everything into my job. 9 years with this company and I feel like I did when I first started
good,"I worked hard.  I learned how to work well under pressure. The managers were all very understanding with every employee.  The hardest part of my job was coming and people from the previous shift did not complete their tasks, so I had to do it before I started my actual job."
good,"Good work environment, easy to get along with coworkers and customers. I really enjoyed working here just looking for something more with steady consistent hours."
good,"I've enjoyed working here very much. It is your typical server job. Not too difficult, just be willing to multitask. Good management. Overall great job."
good,"A typical day at Casey's would be to prepare both pizza and sandwiches as ordered. I would clean what needed to be cleaned, and help my coworkers as necessary. "
good,long ago i worked here. things have changed a bunch. when i was there it was a small outfit. not they are all over. not to sure how they are now but back in the day they were good.
good,"Typical day started out with me coming in at 4:30 am to make doughnuts, coffee, and tea. I learned the process for the doughnuts and how to run the store. Management was very good."
good,"In working with the public, it makes one feel very satisfied to go home at the end of the day knowing they did their best and the customer is satisfied and happy. One happy customer goes a long way towards building the business and ensures the future success."
good,"cook pizza for customers and for warmer"
good,I really enjoyed my job at Casey's overall. I loved getting to interact with the customers and my fellow employees. The hardest part about the job was dealing with several scheduling issues that I was having with the manager. She would approve time off and then not give it to you or she would change the schedule at the last minute and a few people missed shifts due to this.
good,"Some find this job to be too much as their policies are adhered to very strictly, but the opportunity given for the right candidates can be one of the best that anyone can recieve."
good,"I made the doughnuts every morning for 8years. Responsible for getting warmer filled with breakfast items by a certain time.Took pizza orders, then made for customers. Would also stock the cooler with pop and other drinks."
good,I enjoyed the work environment and the management.  Good people to work for and a good starting hourly wage as well.I enjoyed it very much.
good,"I liked working at casey. People help each other out when u need it. Ita good and friendly place to meet people and help people out. Custmers are your life there. Cause if u didnt have them u would not have a job,"
good,"my typical day would consist of makeing food and cleaning, help your cashier move the line along. keepiong everything stocked the best you can, and as clean as you can"
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers. I assisted customers through the check out line. I really didn't have any hard times.
good,"I enjoyed my short time at Casey's. We were a brand new store with a lot of kinks to work out, but we made it through. The people that work there are great."
good,"Casey's General Store takes pride in their company and employees. The company itself has great core values and standards. It pushed me to provide outstanding customer service and taught me how to work in a fast-paced environment. It helped me be more comfortable working in the public and also gave me a chance to network with others. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people on a daily basis and developing friendships. A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers as they entered the store, numerous transactions, recovery and placing orders over the phone. Also taking out the trash and making sure inside and outside the store was clean and organized. Making sure groceries was stocked as well as checking dates on products was a priority."
good,I was the kitchen manager.I had about 10 people under myself.I enjoyed working there.If i had to work for this company again i would.My co-workers and myself got along all the time.
good,"delivering pizza everyday, meeting new people. learned how to understand people. different type of people in the world. manager is great, understanding and a hard worker. some co-worker have your back, some don't. working on the the busy days were crazy. being there having a job to go to."
good,One of my favorite things at caseys are my coworkers. They are awesome! We always work together as a team and help each other out.
good,"Great manager & employees, fun to work at, graveyard shift is appealing for it's regular customers, however it is especially hard labor extensive to stocking & cleaning."
good,"Learned alot of new things, and waited on customers, nothing really hard about the job most enjoyable part was the customers, management was easy to get along with."
good,"A typical day is waiting on customers, i learned alot of diffrent things while i was there everyone was pretty easy to get along with. Management was good hardest part of the job was learning how to make new items enjoyable part was the customers."
good,"In the short time I have worked at this establishment I've made multiple friends and plenty of work-related mistakes but the management always been very kind and understanding of these mistakes, my fellow workers also have helped me along to help me become a better worker in the workplace so I can improve on these mistakes. The overall experience of working here is a very good one."
good,"I work at Casey's as a stocker and truck unload its awesome cool co workers lots of moving around. They.   Benefits  are good hardest part"
good,A typical night start with weighing out 18oz dough balls making pizza for warmers checking times answering phone taking pizza orders and preparing the min timely manner honestly you never know what a night could bring one .  The fast passed always something to do
good,"My time at Casey's was actually one of my most fond memories, the people I met there were all great individuals and helped show me a lot of life lessons through simple things. My management was great they really worked with my schedule and helped figure out an availability for everyone suitably. I learned a lot about assisting customers and working alongside co-works with such interesting backgrounds. I enjoy the times and memories I had there."
good,"I really enjoy all of our customers, I enjoy the fast and steady pace, we have a great crew to work with. The hardest part of my job would be keeping up with the pizza orders when they all come in at the same time."
good,"Casey's General Store was a fun job to have, if you didn't mind almost decent pay and dealing with moronic customers."
good,"I loved working for them, the customers and most of the staff. The staff was friendly and efficient. They mostly worked as a team"
good,"This was a very enjoyable job, with great management. I loved coming to work everyday and working with my coworkers. I enjoyed speaking with customers and ensuring their happiness with our products in the store."
good,I worked for Casey's  for 4 years before moving away. During my time with Casey’s I had many oppertunities for advancement and training. I loved the focus on the customer and the clear standards and expectations set forth by Casey's. I would strongly recommend Casey’s as a college job or a first job out of high school.
good,"Casey's was great to work for. The team you work with is wonderful. Everyone is nice and helpful and things seem to run smoothly. The thing is, Casey's struggles with keeping management and team members. Thus, schedules and that kind of thing get extremely chaotic when there are 30 people trying to pick up all the slack."
good,"Typical day is making pizza, greeting customers, and working as a cashier. There is really no hard part of the job. Management is exceptional and very flexible with my hours, as I also work another job"
good,"I loved working at Casey's. A typical day included doing bookkeeping, and assisting in areas that needed help. My employees did a wonderful job of helping and keeping the store clean. The hardest part of the job was during the last month that I worked there. My boss had had surgery on her wrist so I ran the store, and it was also the most enjoyable because I was in charge of the whole store."
good,"I keep busy at work and get what needs to be done first and go from there. I have learned a variety of different tasks working there. My manager likes when I train new workers because I teach them the right way to do the job. The hardest part of my job is the customers that are crabby, I try and please them the best I can. I enjoy pleasing people and making there day better. A smile means everything to me."
good,"My day at work will be good on a normal day, some days could be stressful."
good,"I as the second assistant manager there was taught a lot, from not only working in a lot of departments, but how to manage a business. a typical day for me was coming in and helping with books or something with order."
good,"Casey's was a fun work environment due to the employees, AND the customers.  Often, we would have to go to other stores for items we were out of, which was very inconvenient if we were busy. The manager is there Monday through Friday from five in the morning, to around two in the afternoon."
good,I would recommend this job if you want to meet different people everyday. The management is good nd they handle situations in a timely manner.
good,"Wait on customers help them with anything that they may need help on. Count money in safe and document information. Help any other employees when needed in the kitchen. Management always able to work with what ever life may throw your way, always caring about everyone. I loved working with people and seeing that I made there day great."
good,"Casey's is a  enjoyable place to work, we have a sub shop where alot of employees enjoy working in, as being assistant manager i will have to say some days are strenuous but rewarding. I enjoy talking with the customers."
good,"Weather if I was in the kitchen or on the register, it was normally super busy. My co-workers was nice people with a few bad apples."
good,I clean and stock the cooler and work on the register. I have learned how to deal with angry customers and how to calm the situation down.
good,Not a bad place to work. Hours are good pay is good. You get raises when your suppose too. Good health care. The work environment wasn't to bad. Usually good people to work with.
good,Working at Casey's was a good experience and definitely fast paced. The manager was also understanding in situations.
good,"A typical day at work would include 10+ working hours. I have learned a lot about self control and just ignoring certain aspects (mainly drama) from this company. The management seems to always be stressed out, which seems to be from all the excessive work hours for little pay. The hardest part about this job is working 50+ hours a week, always being on the phone when you do get to go home, and never having time to spend with your family. The most enjoyable part about this company was all of the wonderful and loyal customers that you got to interact with and get to know on a daily basis."
good,See lots of customers everyday. Very fast paced. Have a ver successful pizza business.
good,As much as I like working with people there's something to be said to having the whole place to yourself. I made donuts and breakfast items for 3 hours by myself before the store opened. Just listening to music on the radio made those hours fly.
good,"good place to work, fun times, and always something new to learn"
good,"Daily book work, Balancing books, scheduling, ordering, inventory, and managing employees and making the customers happy."
good,"Fair pay and benefits, usually good hours, no complaints about Casey's General Stores"
good,"I enjoyed this position very much. I learned accounts, balancing respectful friendship and leadership relationships with co-workers. I also took on opening and closing store, stocking, cooking, cleaning, inventory, computer skills along with great communication skills."
good,"Caseys in Nashville IL is a great place to work. Decent raises, good benefits, advancement opportunities. "
good,"it was ok, people were nice, customers were great, management was somewhat unrelaiable"
good,Everyone was very productive and kept things going. Everybody was good at listening to anyone of higher position than them. I learned alot about good people skills and having good communitcation.
good,I moved up quickly from being a kitchen person to management. it taught me a lot and I matured a lot along the way
good,I enjoyed meeting new people working in a convenience store environment.  I thought most of the management were pleasant and I gained an overall concept of the retail business as a whole.
good,"Go in count money, do paper work, open the store, check people out. How to talk to people do all the store computer. I like my manager she is very good. They are very hard worker and very good. Is to put up with customer. Working in the office."
good,"A ""typical"" day at work is never the same each day. Depending on how the customers want to spend their days, I can be busy or I can be slow. Almost every day I do the same thing: make pizzas, make sandwiches, salads, do dishes, clean, and stock. I've learned that people may become very irritated if they do not recieve what they want, when they want it. Between the three managers I had while working at Casey's, each one was different. My first manager did not seem to like her job, so she did not really care about the store. My second manager wanted to turn the store around and make it a selling store. My third and current manager is very laid back, and seems to enjoy her job and the employees who work there. She helps out as much as she can with everything. Most co-workers I was not able to get to know very well. Casey's seems to go through employees faster than the gas prices change. But the ones that have been able to stay for the time that I have been there have always told me the things that I have been doing wrong, or the things that I have done well. The hardest part of the job would probably be trying to please everyone at one time. Or getting the dough to turn out just right. The most enjoyable part of my job would be knowing that when someone enjoys the service that I provide to them, they like to come back to the store or order more often."
good,i love working with people learning new things and just have a good day at work.
good,"The co-workers are fun and, helpful to make the job easier.  The co-workers are understanding if something comes up and, you can not work that day.  They can find some one to cover the shift.  The pizza is delicious.  They have the best taco pizza around."
good,In a typical day I would take over for the person on the shift before me and get a short brief about what has been done and what needed to be done. The co-workers were very friendly and fun to work with.
good,"Co-workers and managers are easy to get a long with. The shifts are a little odd, could be switched up a little."
good,The job is quite simple for the most part. It does get a little nerve racking when it's busy but you'll have that anywhere. You can get pretty much any day off you want as long as you request in advance.
good,over all its a fin place to work i like my job. i been working there for two years and im just looking for a new place to learn new experience
good,"A great job for those who are excellent at multitasking. Typical day involves either being in the kitchen preparing food for customers or being up at the register and maintaining the store. Different shifts vary from store to store. Most managers are very understanding that a person has a life outside of their job. A person will learn various new skills. Most difficult part of the job is obtaining advancement. Although the job seems easy once a person has the basics down, it does take a while for an opportunity to move up to come along."
good,I have learned a lot in the past year. While working with casey's. Have put my past work experiences to good use. I get to see old and new customers each day.
good,"I like to work there, but its time for me to find a better job with normal hours."
good,I loved my time working at Casey's.  Great management team.  Friendly Staff.  Plenty of room for advancement if you would like to move up in the company.
good,My time at Casey's was a good experience. My Managers were very good to work with and I rarely had any issues with the company itself. Overall Casey's is a very solid Company in general.
good,people was fun to work with  and a good place to work you learn to do things for your life and work with very good people at a very good place to work
good,"Fun work place, and they have great benefit's for all employee's. Competative wages for the company  management and regular employee's."
good,"I really like working there but my issue is that I only work 4 hours a week, and they keep hitting people. I've asked for more hours but I can't get more apparently as of right now"
good,"Well organized company, well fit job to have. Great people to work with as well as always looking out for the best in people no matter what the circumstances are."
good,The job is a good starter job i went in not knowing alot of things about the workforce this job helped me figure it out. They are also very supportive of your schooling making shifts that could fit aroind my schedule.
good,For the most part it's a great job to have and the people are great to work with. Work week for the most part is set in stone with a few changes once in awhile and higher management is usually a phone call away for any questions. :-)
good,A typical day at work was great. Customers were very friendly and I always looked forward to talking to so many people at work. Friendly staff and management.
good,"i had to quit due to personal health concerns so i can't actually give much details in regards to everything about the job but from what i dealt with during my training it seems fairly simple in regards to expectation, but you  need to be able to work under pressure."
good,It was for the most part a very easy going place to work. The only things that need improving i think is the companies attention on providing the employees with the cleaning and office tools needed for the tasks required of them. Some employees had to bring thing from home in order to correctly complete certain tasks.
good,Great good job well paid good work environment well managed good work speed enjoyed working there a lot everyone was kind to eachother and did what was asked
good,Casey's is a great job I enjoy it because there's a lot to do to keep you busy. Casey's is a good job because they make sure they give you 50% off on all food while you're there working. They give you breaks as needed. And they have a great health plan and dental insurance.
good,"If your looking relaxed slow paced full or part time, working the overnight cashier position at Casey's General store is nice. Just enough traffic comes in to make the night go by decent. I do know the morning and day shifts at Casey's it can get pretty busy quick. But as for a little extra money it's a good place to work. JJoe"
good,"I enjoyed working at Caseys and learning different things like lottery, changing coffee filters, as well as learning the kitchen. Management was also great on the higher up end."
good,I only worked there briefly when i was in highschool and from what i took from it was good. They had a solid staff and would work with you more on your schedule.
good,My management was great to work with and I enjoyed the work I did. Our customers always left satisfied with their customer service they received. They may have walked in not smiling but we had them leave with a smile.
good,Mostly working for this place is mostly about repetition it's a decent job to have that gives a good amount of money per hour but the one here in Watertown on Highway 20 need better training personnel
good,"Enjoyed working for the company."
good,Working at Casey's was my first job and it really helped working me into society and the job was easy but challenging at times and everyone was very cooperative and made working enjoyable
good,Casey's is a wonderful place to work if you love customer service.  The only thing I find wrong is the pay.  You can go work at McDonalds or Walmart and make more than an employee at Casey's.  Benefits are expensive and are all a separate cost.  Due to that they cannot retain employee's.  The staff is great.
good,Great part-time job for me. I am a stable employee who has never had a tardy or absentee problem in all my years of working. I would still be there if we hadn't decided to move to Arizona.
good,Fantastic manager that was very willing to work with her employees. Upper management could definitely learn something from her. They were unwilling to listen to any employee concerns.
good,You will work more hours and get treated better if you work part-time. As soon as they make you full time everything is fixed. General manager was a good worker but other managers liked to slack.
good,"Casey's is a high traffic convenience store that commands employees to be able to think and provide solutions on the go. At the store I worked at, we had tasks that were to be completed throughout our shift, and would be considered challenging work to keep up with the pace. The store I worked at allowed its employees to have fun on the job (within reason) as long as the work was completed and we put the customer first above all else. The management was laid back and flexible and easy to approach with problems or issues. It is a great place to learn or enhance customer service skills."
good,"I have worked at Casey's off and on a couple times. Each time there are new people there and some training to go through. Learning there is easy because everyone helps each other in the learning process. A typical day there, you just keep busy, meet customer needs and everyone goes home happy. Management there is great, they always have their bases covered. Working there allowed me to go through several college courses and still make a paycheck. Amazing people there."
good,short staffed.....long hours on feet   but fun and fast paced  perfect job for young and older     low pay :(  but works around you schedule so you can have family and life
good,Typical retail enviroment with great regular customers and enough varied situations to never get bored. Loved my managers and learned a lot from them.
good,"Hello today I will right a day in the life of me."
good,Casey's can be a productive place to work for. If everyone can do their job right. It can be stressful at times. We all help each other out.  Manager is very good working around your schedule when u need time off.
good,"At Casey's I worked graveyard shift, and so I mostly did store chores and cleaned.  What I learned was preparing food orders and more experience at cash handling than previous jobs."
good,Caseys was a good place to work. It can be a fast paced job. Some of the management was good. The pay could have been better. There is a lot to learn there.
good,the job was pretty good for what i was working for. the management was nice and the overall work environment was nice as well. i was always postive going to work for the day.
good,Everybody was friendly and training was great. the store manager was very helpful and was actually involved in getting things done. it is hard to find that in a leader these days. I absolutely loved working there. I did food prep. Cooked pizza and sub sandwiches. Cleaned the kitchen and much much more. Couldn’t have asked for a better working environment. Caseys was a great place to work. Friendly workers and customers. Give you acknowledgment for a job well done! Room for advancement within the company!
good,Easy to get along with the other coworkers that I work with along with my manager. Positive surroundings throughout my conworkers as well as my customers that come in and out each day
good,"I enjoyed my time at Casey's overall. Although it could get hectic, the job environment was still always positive and the team always pulled through. My manager was/is a wonderful boss who was very caring towards not just the store, but the employees as well."
good,The day starts with getting everything set up in the kitchen and then working on making sure warmers are full and doing orders while completing a list of daily tasks that employees do every day.
good,"I would take orders and fill them. I would also be responsible for cleaning up any dishes and utensils that were used during my shift."
good,"Come in at 3 in the morning, and i made donuts for Casey's. Worked alone most days, but occasionally had an associate that worked as well. Allowed creativity with what was created, and was off the clock by 8 at the latest."
good,It was a very easy going job if you knew what you were doing. I enjoyed working with my friends that got jobs there. The workplace could have used more discipline because some of the workers were terrible to work with and to work after.
good,"Good company to work for, decent salary and benefits, potential for advancement, vacation time, 401 k, great food, clean environment, team work a must."
good,everything was fine besides the manager. he was a jerk and was always hiring new people and then cutting my hours. come to find out hes stealing from the company
good,very friendly place to work. was happy with my coworkers and able to get along with everybody. can be both slow and fast paced depending on the day. !!
good,It was a good place to work with friendly employees and managers the computers were easy to learn and products in the store were easy to find and therefore easy to help customers to find
good,"While on duty I was responsible for opening the store, morning books, and running the till. "
good,"Always staying busy cleaning, stocking, cooking, prepping food Items for the day. Friendly work base with determined employees ready to greet every customer as they walk through the door"
good,"Not a bad place to work, just a lot of drama. Boss is a hard worker, so ore some of the other workers who don't start drama. ........................,."
good,"At Casey's the management and staff all help each other out when needed, hours are very reasonable, work place is welcoming. i would recommend Casey's to anyone"
good,"Great place to work as a team, and with public. Patrons are usually polite and courtious. Managers at stores are very willing to help employees with getting them the training they may need."
good,"Working for Casey's for a short time, the atmosphere is great, the co-workers are always willing to help out. I enjoy being able to work in different positions."
good,"rang up customers"
good,"great place to work for, assuming the management is good. Hours are hard to come by if you aren't a hard worker. The schedule isn't set, which makes planning other personal events a bit tricky."
good,"I loved my job and the customers at caseys,would still ne there today if some unforseen events had not had happened.I loved my customers and co-workers"
good,"-A typical day at work(in Kitchen)- as I get customer walk in orders for subs, make those, as pizza orders came in, make those, in between get stuff/supplies ready for the next day, clean as the shift goes on, stock/refill supplies, and delegated closing duties(wipe counters,sweep,dishes,and mop)"
good,"Management and co-workers were very dependable and reliable in the work place, making it easier for management and assistants to get things done in the work place"
good,Easy job as long as you do your part and keep everything updated.
good,"I learned many things working for Casey's, like how to adapt to stressful situations. I had my store manager walk out of the store and quit in my first two weeks of working there. It left me and one other staff member to deal with the store till we could get another manager to come in. I there after learned how to deal with the rotating management until a stable store manager was placed. I loved the job and the fellow coworkers. It was however hard to maintain a stable work schedule and for a pregnant women that was stressful."
good,"I would come in and clock myself in do a drawer change with the person on the next shift and then I would take the reins from there checking people out and counting money back all evening. towards the end of shift I would have to change all the garbages inside and outside and leave the cash register unattended which I did not like because the people working the kitchen area didn't know how to use the register so if I had a customer come in while I was back behind the dumpster throwing the garbage away they would have to sit and wait for me to get back. management was alright, they did a good job training me but it seemed like the area manager was out to fire all the teenagers who worked in her stores.. she even wrote me up in front of a store full of people and completely humiliated me in front of everyone. I was 16 people... other than that working for caseys was fun I loved my co-workers."
good,I have been able to transfer to different stores and was able to move up in the company very rapidly with some hard work!
good,I work 11 hours a day minimum going in at 5 am.  I start on books matching up all paper work and getting deposit ready takes usually a couple of hours.  I than work the floor and register checking in vendors and interacting with customers and employees.  I love that part of my job.  The hardest part is the job leaves no time for family and that is important to me.  I tend to work between 60 and 70 hours sometimes a week and its too much.
good,"Working for Casey's is a roller coaster. Some days we are busy, some days are slow. I work with food all day, for witch they sent me to IL food sanatation classes. My co workers are like any other co-workers. Some are great, some not. The hardest part about this job is picking up the slack that others have left for you. I enjoy my regular customers who come into the store just to see me."
good,"The store that I work at has an amazing management staff. They work well with the issues and conflicts that are in the work place. The store manager is easy going and nice to talk to, she is also very understanding."
good,"I run the cash register on a general day.  When I am the manager on duty, I take care of editing and finalizing the daily books as well as taking the deposits to the bank.  I designate assignments for fellow workers.  I take care of customer complaints or issues to the extent of the authority that I can.  "
good,I worked in the warehouse picking orders and found that the lack of micro management made that job worth while.  Not to mention the 4 day work week and awesome management staff.
good," A  day on the register-"
good,"A typical day there really was nice our customer was great .I learned the book work how to do the ordering scheduling, payroll and how to resolve customer complaints quite a learning experience was promoted to assistant manager within a couple months.my coworkers and I worked together as a team. The hardest part to me was our turnover rate.My most enjoyable part was my customers as long as they were happy i was happy."
good,a typical day at work is just getting your normal tasks done such as helping customers. keeping things stocked like for the next shift and cleaning. i have learned how to make pizzas at caseys since working there. my manager is a very nice lady to work with. the other employers at caseys have been very nice to work with also. there is not really anything hard about my job now that i have learned how to do everything.
good,"I started off as a cashier. I learned how to use the register very quickly. The managers were very hands - on and helpful. My co - workers were helpful, nice to talk too, and always kept a positive attitude. The hardest part of my job was constantly taking phone calls for carry - out orders for pizza. The most enjoyable part of my job was stocking inventory with my co - workers."
good,Customers are what make the company good or bad. Everyone has times where their day isn't going well. If you keep a positive outlook and try your best to make the customer satified then it will make your job and their life much easier.
good,"I don't have much for complaints. Caseys takes care of there workers."
good,"Each and every day that I worked was great. Even though it was a long day, it flew by because of the people that worked there. They were great people with amazing personalities and they taught me a lot about customer service and would help with anything that I needed."
good,"It was a good place to work for a beginner job. Plenty of hours and fresh new faces everyday. Plenty of task so you could stay busy, and for something to do at all times"
good,I was let go for activating a green dot card over the phone. I called my manager as soon as it happened but there was nothing we could do. I offered to pay it back and they declined. Me and my boss never thought she was ever gonna have to fire me or I was gonna leave. I loved my job there. So now I can never be rehired even though I offered to pay for my mistake and they declined even though people that sell to minors can be rehired in 6 months and that costs them money and possibly other things and I really dont think that is right at all. They should also have a way to void such transactions so it wouldnt be such a big deal and people could fix their mistake like everyone does all the time.
good,I love the people that work there. Just wish people would work better as a team. Sometimes poor  team work to help the other out on stuff. It can be overwhelming at times when you have so much to do and not enough time to do it.
good,"Casey's is a good place to work. I would recommend working there to a friend. They work around your hours as much as they can. I worked during the day and the employees working that shift were great. However, I did have to leave due to not enough hours in a pay period and living in a different town."
good,Feliz muy emotivo emocionante cautivador muy buena
good,Can be fast-pace or just standing around most of the time which allows for a little chit-chat. Rarely take breaks unless you're a smoker. manager was not great but all the employees were fun and hardworking. May have to work on holidays but you get time and a half.
good,I met someone new all the time.  I was able to advance quickly in the job.  I was able to learn every job at the store.  I enjoyed the atmosphere.  My co workers was amazing.
good,never have i dreamed of becoming a leader but everyday i would take hours i would fill call ins and i would master the art of a local loved pizza and more at a great small town genral store i learned everything quick and fast and was moved to full time management where i could run and train the kitchen to be the best we can be a great matured job
good,"Productive work place, I loved working for the company for almost 12 years, had to quit bc of a sudden move out of state and unfortunately the state I live in now doesn't have Casey's general stores in the whole state"
good,"I enjoyed working here, very good place and well paced environment. Management was good at their job. Well paid and compensated. Hours were flexible to your needs."
good,"Fast paced work, Can be confusing at first getting used to the radio system. Work as hard as you want. Pulling inventory for stores. packing into totes. Learning not to overload totes."
good,"it's a good job experience and friendly people ,great management, team work skills are good, everything is organized and well put together I give a+++"
good,Management is very good. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers. I learned many new things such as cash register. The hardest part is busy hours.
good,On an average day the work is easy the customers were great thIe general manager at the time was great upper management wasn't very nice they want you to work all the time and dont care about your personal life they will schedule you for 10 plus days in a row i worked 50 hours a week most of the time especially when they were short handed did alot of the 1st assistants job never got appreciated for it but overall its not a bad place to work
good,Casey's General store makes advancement easy. The pay is great from the start. Dealing with the public is always tough but the Casey's environment makes it easier.
good,This place is a fun place to work for.  I would recommend this company to anyone to work for if you like dealing with people and money. Also there is room to advance.
good,"I worked in the mornings 7am to 3:30pm. I made the cookies for the display and I also had to make sure the warmer was always full and that the food doesn't go over the time limit and I took orders for pizzas and I had to make sure I had them done in 15 to 25 minutes. I cleaned my own dishes and cleaned the floors before the next shift came in. I learned how to stock the fridges with drinks, and how to make the dough for the pizzas and how to make pin wheels and sandwhichs. The manager was really nice and helpful. The workplace is fastgoing most of the time through the night shift. The hardest part is keeping the warmer full when you have a lot of orders to fill."
good,"Work register, handle all exchanges and returns, work dressing rooms, unload truck, and organize, stock, & clean products."
good,"I enjoyed all the co-workers in the kitchen, as well as the students who came through. Was very nice to be able to answer any questions they might have had.  Was exciting on a daily basis to learn new food cooking techniques and preparation skills."
good,"The job itself is nice, the people are great and the managers work with the employees to keep moral in the workplace up. The people I work with are nice and very helpful. It's sort of a no one gets left on their own kind of place. We look out for each other. The hardest part is probably just the dinner rushes. It gets a little hectic but cools down pretty quickly."
good,"I worked there for almost 3 years and loved it. Same faces, nice people, and I loved the people I worked with."
good,"Cleaning, stocking merchandise, working as a cashier, all trained me to be a good manager for this business."
good,"This is a great company to work for once you make it out of the stores. Being one of the cashiers or kitchen cooks is frustrating, but pushing through that into management has it's rewards."
good,Great company to work for. Great pay for a very easy job. Management and crew members work alongside one another and everyone was very helpful on a daily basis.
good,"It is an enjoyable place to work. The management is friendly and encouraging.  Fellow staff members make coming to work enjoy"
good,"Hardest part was working donut shift. 2am-9am. But was also self satisfying knowing I was helping a co-worker. Manager was the best manager I've ever had. Understanding, flexible, kind, and respectful."
good,"Taking calls for pizzas, helping customers in store. Being able to make pizzas. Just the ideal of  being able to help out in the kitchen when not out on a delivery."
good,"Fast paced job with a great group of employees! Friendly, hardworking, fun people who like their jobs and the people they work with. Our manager is dedicated and if any problems do arise the manager gets them fixed as soon as possible."
good,"It was a fast-paced, fun environment to work in. Learned how to interact with hundreds of customers a day. I enjoyed meeting new people and developing social skills"
good,"In my 3 years at Casey's I have learned many things. Everyone handles situations differently but as long as you have people surrounding you who care, you will be fine. Some days the workload would be more stressful than others; for example, with cutbacks on hours it makes it more stressful for managers to create the schedules and staff to get the same amount of work done in less time than provided before."
good,Dealing with customers that would buy products or gas from Casey's. Making sure that the rest rooms where clean. Making sure that the ice was stock in the summer time.
good,"The staff and management at the Casey's I worked at were excellent, could have paid more but everything else was great. However I know someone who worked at another Casey's nearby that had the complete opposite experience."
good,"This job was high paced and you had to deal with annoying customers, but the people and benefits are pretty good. If I didn't have to leave I would still work there gladly."
good,"I loved working at Casey's. Good people to work for. Friendly environment. If there was an issue, the Manager's solved it right away. I left, cause I kept on getting denied for any advancement."
good,"only my second job, loved making pizzas, had a good crew, its a job and your there to work, can be fun! i worked with a good crew and made some friends out of it. manager wasn't always the best, but overall wasn't incompetent."
good,"I love working at Caseys. If I wasnt going back to Tennessee, I would definetly stay in my position. I have a good team and a wonderful store manager."
good,"Working at Casey's general store is a good balance between fast and relaxed pace of work. A typical day is walking in the morning with a line already there waiting for you. Other days it is a ghost town. The management is good, both managers keep each other balance with authority. Every employee is treated the same and is praised when a job is well and safely done right. The best part of the jobs is meeting new people and regulars everyday."
good,"The only thing that makes the work environment a little less attractive is all the drama that went on when I was working.  The job at Casey's itself is great, a fun place to be able to work with the public and preparing the food that we serve.  You can advance pretty easily at Casey's and that is a great thing as well.  The pay for a management position is not the best, as a few employees were still making more than I was and I was an assistant manager, so that could be changed."
good,"I loved this job. No complaints other than bad management. Management, paper work, schedule, customer service, retail, invoice, order,unload trucks, ect"
good,Loved being able to meet new people that came in every day. I enjoyed being able to make pizzas and doing all the prep work along with it. This was probably one of my favorite jobs.
good,I arrive to work 15 minutes early every shift. I get right to work making pizzas and cleaning/prepping the kitchen. I do everything I need to do until it is time to actually clean at 10:30 for close. Finally I wash all the dishes and clean the lobby area at caseys.
good,Most of the employee's and management worked well with each other. I enjoyed my 2 years at that company and Casey's provided stability. It just was just time to move on.
good,"My typical day ran smoothly, making sure warmers were stocked, and orders were complete on time. I learned how to prep and make donuts, pizza, etc. My management was very supportive, encouraging, and always listened if there was ever an issue. The hardest part of this job is simply just dealing with all the orders you get and trying to be very fast paced while cooking. What i enjoyed the most about my job was learning new things and getting better and the things i had learned."
good,"My typical work day included going to multiple stores to review sales, GP margins, payroll, scheduling, etc. My co-workers were great. We all worked together as a team. The hardest part of this job was having multiple issues at one time and prioritizing which issue had the most impact. The most enjoyable part of this job was increasing sales and developing future leaders."
good,"During my day I worked with customers and checked them out after they were done buying gas, drinks, and food."
good,"A typical day would start off slow with few customers which made it easier to get my cleaning list done, as the day progressed we would have more customers which makes the day go by faster and things run smoother. I learned how to deal with the public, handle money, and do things at a fast pace. Management was not always consistent but they always keep you motivated and on task. My co-workers were always a delight. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers that wanted to yell at me for things that i could not control but i had to remain calm and assertive. On the other hand the best part was the good customers and co-workers that reminded me why i loved working with the public."
good,"I count register and make sure things are cleaned and filled for the customers. Paperwork, deposits, scanning vendors, and running a register. I learned many things as far as customer service and accuracy. Most co-workers are young and don't stay long. The hardest part is the scheduling. It is a 24 hour store and all shifts need to be covered and others to cover if one can't make it in."
good,I work with good people. There have been some recent changes in upper level management that have created unrealistic expectations. Labor has continiously been reduced overall with task requirements increased. I consider myself well equipped to complete tasked as specified by my job. In this situation my time management ability is maximally challenged. This has caused the stress levels in our store to be extremely high. The standing schedule I work is perfect for the business of my lifestyle.
good,Your typical day is spent making friends with coworkers while working in a fast paced environment making pizza or running the register. At times it can be very busy and stressful if you cannot handle the fast paced kitchen needs. Management is very understanding and helps out when schedule conflicts arise
good,"The store I worked at was very relaxed in its atmosphere and discipline. The policies were followed, but not strictly controlled. The work was interesting, but not particularly challenging."
good,Liked the schedule. Enjoyed the crew that I worked with. Team effort had by all employees. Customer interaction was friendly atmosphere. Overall great place to work.
good,I liked working in the kichin had to learn how to make pizza and sub sandwiches fast at the same time so it was good to see how others work there and how they did it cause it taught me diff was to do it myself
good,Previously did a review on this company for a previous position. Still a great place to work. Great advancement opportunity. Wonderful management if you get lucky.
good,I spent two years with Casey's and it was the best two years of employment I've had thus far. The work environment was relaxed when it could be. Managers were super involved and understanding.
good,I really enjoyed working at Caseys. I just left my job there due to bullying from coworker and boss. I tried to resolve situation but got ganged up on instead. Good fast paced job and I like the customers.
good,I worked in the kitchen here too. Everyone was awesome the employees where nice. I happened to come back to this job for a few more months after a leave from a diffrent job. I was being trained for regiester some before i left.
good,"Like all the people I work with and my boss is great. Get to meet all kinds of people. It is usually a very busy store, so fast moving pace most of the time. Have daily cleaning duties to do, restock shelves and cooler."
good,"Loved working herer"
good,"I loved my job. Great company to work for and although i didn't always agree with my manager, we had a great crew of employees. The hardest part of the job was having to spend any amount of time stocking the cooler. The most enjoyable part of the job was everything else."
good,"I honestly loved working for Casey's General Stores. They are great with their employees and my store manager was the best anyone could ask for. The environment was always friendly and it was one of the times when I can say I actually looked forward to going to work. I made a lot of friends working there and I miss the job completely. My typical day would be running the register and helping customers while also making sure the store was kept neat and clean. I learned how to interact with customers on a friendly basis and how to operate the reigster and handle money efficently. The hardest part of the job was leaving. Honestly. The job wasn't anything no one could handle it was fairly simple once you got the hang of everything, but it was one of the jobs were either you like it or you don't and sad to say we had a lot of employees that were only there for a month before they left. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and being able to talk to other people."
good,My experience with this company was a pleasant one.
good,"Loved working here, and not a bad time. Work hours went by fast. Worked with customers, and was more communicated with others. I enjoyed it alot because of all the people coming in with big smiles and brightening my days when i wasnt in the greatest mood!"
good,"Perfect! Love my job very much and the managers are great and the company is great. Flexible hours, understanding employees and management! Love my job and plan to stay!"
good,It was such a great job and everyone I worked with was fun. I never had a dull day at Casey’s and I would always take uncovered shifts so I would make a lot of overtime
good,"I worked for this company for 5 years,we had our ups and downs but overall a wonderful company"
good,"Working at Casey's was pretty simple, take care of customers, keep workspace tidy and clean, and do whatever your manager asks of you without complaints."
good,I looked forward to providing excellent customer service. The job was busy but easy work. I was able to learn alot in management. Would have never left but the store manager at the time was very difficult to work for.
good,As a salary member of Management  it was pretty hard to have a family life. Also you had no time off. because there was no one to take you place. The assistant would always call out as well as the employee.
good,"Keeps you busy, always something to do, pay and hours are fair. Management could use some improvement but otherwise are awesome. Half the staff get along and they're the ones that work as a team, plus end up carrying the weight and go the extra steps."
good,The Casey's I worked at was a joke putting it nice. None of them did their jobs I was supposed to be training as 2 nd asst And never  got to because I was always put in the kitchen because they cook had a thing with the bosd
good,Caseys is a fun place to work if you enjoy making food and talking to people. You meet a lot of different types of people working here. you also work with money often.
good,"I learned that sometimes in the workforce you can work very hard and even though you work harder then some you, sometimes still have to know people to get ahead. The co workers were not bad but they kept switching managers and there were always new rules. I think I enjoyed working there because of the people I got to see everyday, the interaction."
good,make pizzas for customers that come in to the store or order of ther phone
good,I loved working for Casey's. Their pizza was wonderful. Very clean. Our store was brand new so it was clean when I left not sure about now. If I ever was in the area where there is a Casey's II would definitely go back to work there.
good,"I had fun working there, I got to meet new people everyday and the only thing I would fix is the management. The managers don't listen to any employees as far as medical issues or if they need time off due to medical. "
good,I just couldn't do over nights very well I enjoyed working there nice people I am a diabetic it was messing with my blood sugars so that's why I couldn't do over nights anymore
good,"Had I not moved to Arizona, I would have loved to stay there.  I loved Casey's. From the Employee's and to Management.  The staff was wonderful. I loved the hours, and I enjoyed my job."
good,"Working at Casey's was always steady business. Always something to do. Loved the people i worked with, always a helping hand when needed! Team work was the key to a successful business and help for yor shift to go smoothly and customers were happy. One thing you always have to remember no matter what customers are always right no matter what!"
good,"Depending on my schedule I was there ALOT!! Sometimes from 5am-10pm. I would do books, including deposits, lottery, cig counts..etc. I would check in vendors, file paperwork, make cleaning lists and just overall supervise while running register. I loved seeing my regular customers everyday! They made my job worth every second. When I couldn't make everybody happy no matter what I did or how many hours I worked really put a down spin on staying at the company"
good,"I learned how to handle stress and pressure while working as a teammate and helping customers.  I loved making pizzas, talking to the customers and building relationships with those around me."
good,I enjoyed my time with Casey's. The biggest challenge was finding and hiring dependable help. The upper regional manager did not provide adequate support to those below her role.
good,They do not hire anyone with a background and they do expect you to be there when you're supposed to and even when you are just needed not a bad place of work I loved working there.
good,"I enjoyed it over all but had young kids to take care of... Single parent made it a challenge and my grandfather was dying...."
good,Work wasn't hard and everyone was super nice. The environment was peaceful most of the time and I had no problem with management. the customers we nice to.
good,Job was fun and easy. Only downside was watching the company waste so much food and throw away so much pizza when the employees could eat it. Management was the absolute worst and played favouritism to girls over guys lady's got whatever they wanted
good,overall great place to work. my only concern was with corporate polocies that came down on us in the store. and the ones who would decide cetain decisions never took the time in the store.
good,"I enjoyed the job and my customers. The employees and managment no good , no team work and boss had favorites she catered to. I would work at other Caseys"
good,Would not work for the same manager that was over this caseys when I was there.   Caseys is a good company to work for. Most people there were very easygoing to get along with
good,Making Pizza is awesome. It gives you some sort of creativeness about making someone's food and making it taste the best it can possibly be. However Casey's doesn't give your props for creativeness or wanting to grow in your position very much
good,"A typical day at Caseys General store is overall easy. The customers are great. I'v learned that communication is key when talking to the customers. Management is great, they are easy to work with. I really do not talk to my co workers because I am there to work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers when they get upset. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing what the customers want and building a friendship with them."
good,"Would help customers, Open store, close store, work in the kitchen."
good,"Keeping up with coffee and customers, I have learned to smile and greet customers , cause the customers will come back when they remember that they had a pleasent experience with you. I enjoy working with some of my customers. Others like to cause trouble for others . They don't like to do their jobs. Working with a few people and the manager and her people like to take alot of cigerate breaks with you being the only cashier with a lot of customers waiting to be waited on. See the customers happy with their purchase/"
good,I learned how to open and close the store.
good,Good place to work if you like people good pay for a gas station.  Good manager good co workers.  Fun and you meet new people every day.  They offer insurance
good,Loved working for Casey's if I could go back for the right amount of pay and find a Casey's close that would rehire me it would be a definate yes. Love the environment the customers the co workers.
good,You could always find something to do so it was never boring. The work was not very mentally strenuous and the most you ever would have to pick up was a 50 pound bag.
good,"Great place to work and great people to work with. For my life style, 2 kids,  single parent. 9$/hr at roughly 30 hrs a week, paid every 2 weeks, doesn't cut it.  I do a lot of driving with dr appointments and taking the kids to the babysitter. I roughly drive 100+ miles a day. And im always broke by the end of the first week after pay day.  There just isn't enough hours for everyone. Especially when we're all part time and some only get 15 hrs a week if they're lucky... great place for someone who has minimal to no bills and no children to care for."
good,"I liked working there got along with everyone, I only left due to a manager scheduling me certain hours and not telling me she would just change it on me with out talking or asking me if it would work for me or not we started butting heads took me a year to get to 40hrs never called in or called in sick.. I worked hard for what little I made but never complained I just came down to Casey's wasn't for me anymore and I needed to move on."
good,"Its a great place to work! Fun atmosphere, the customers are the best! It's all about teamwork and there's a great staff that know what teamwork is. Management is strict but as long as you do your job you're good."
good,Casey's isn't a bad place to work. I enjoyed the first 3 years of it.the benefit's are amazing  and most of the stores work as a team. It would be nice if all supervisors  followed the book.
good,"I completely enjoyed my job at Casey's, I just didn't like the fact there was no management support.  I learned a lot about management working this job."
good,"They are good at training their employees, it was over all a good job experience. You get 50% off pizza, and donuts. 25 cent raise every 3 months."
good,i loved worked at Econolodge the employees there were very nice and helpful but it didn't work out at the time because i was working for Casey's when i got hired
good,"fun work place with supportive management not all about numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this expected of a big company"
good,learned how to run the register. it was a nice place to work for until management changed hands!! coworkers was easy to get along with
good,Casey's is generally a good place to work easy to get along with employees and customers the work space is clean all tools to make the food and cut vegetables are always cleaned to our liking
good,"I like working for caseys, most of the time we have a helping hand everywhere... we strive to make our customers happy. An work hard to keep them smiling an coming back to see us."
good,"Taking care of your financial future. Financial benefits for you and your family may include…"
good,I would work for Casey again but I move back to Texas... the Environment was great... my kids came to get there donuts in the morning... and I would make the best pizza for my customers
good,The people are friendly a fun to work for. They are understanding and help make the work environment a lot better and make the employees feel appreciated
good,Good place to work. Friendly staff and customers. I have received a lot of different experiences from this store and plan to keep learning and growing.
good,Very busy place to work. Loved co-workers and customers. I learned how to make pizza's and sandwiches. My store manager was amazing. I loved working here. Truck days were stressful. I loved the customers I miss working there
good,Great understanding work environment for a fast pace experience for it I can talk about it opened the job for a fast learning and cleaned areas that were not
good,"I worked as a preschool teacher in the child development center, which is located at the Casey's Corporate Headquarters in Ankeny, Iowa.  It was a wonderful place!"
good,"I basically worked by myself. I had one other person working with me but he was doing his own thing while I was. I would come in and work register. I have excellent customer service. Cleaning up the store took up the rest of the time. Then finally, closing paperwork."
good,"Great team leader ,workplace culture the most enjoyable part of the job is preparing orders, i actually liked working at Casey's General store it was an great experience"
good,A typical day at work I would be cooking pizzas or any other food really. Cleaning up after I am done and serving food out to the warmers for the customers.
good,"it was alright place to work. loved my boss super easy to get a long with, ups and downs with every job. you stay busy with little stuff weather its cleaning or cooking or making sandwiches."
good,I work different hours. Love my coworkers some are easy to get along with and some are sometimes hard but fast paced environment sometimes it’s laid back sometimes it hard work
good,Casey's General Store is a very good store to work for good flexible hours good team members in very good managers if I could I would work at Casey's General Store again
good,"Started out s delivery driver, but went back to the kitchen. I'm kind of a grumpy person at first, but they were able to work around that and paired me with enjoyable staff. I enjoyed my time there, but sometimes the customers could be challenging."
good,Casey's is a fun place to work at and fair. The employees  are all awesome to work with. The managers are awesome and fair when issues pop up. It's easy to do and fun.
good,I worked morning shifts had a set schedule loved my everyday customers all the employees were great we were a big family. General manager was great and overall the job was wonderful. I wish I could work there again
good,Great environment to work co workers were friendly and helped each other. Can challenge you when it gets busy and makes you a great worker with customer service skills
good,I absolutely loved the store and the staff at the store that I worked at. The team was hard working but also a lot of fun. There was never a dull moment.
good,It is a great work place and coworkers. It is never a bad day or attitudes at the store. Our manager terri is one of the best people i have ver worked for. There is a dew lazy peoole but i canr expect everyone to work as hard as i do.
good,If the manager didn't want to come in because someone called out sick she would contentiously call you so she didn't have to. Manager didn't hold other employees accountable. She would make everyone else do her job.
good,It was an ok place to work. Very stressful and confusing. Management wasn’t that good either. Pay kind of sucked. I wish it was better. I would’ve stayed
good,"This place was very fun to work for because of my supervisor. Overall, i like the company and all the benefits they offered to their employees at the company."
good,"Every employee is fun and easily to work with, everyone helps out each other when there is a lot of questions. I am in love with my management position, as it has advanced me in my position and knowledge."
good,They over work their staff a ridiculous amount and cut hours all the time yet never want to hire anyone new then complain once they don’t have enough people to work said set hours they schedule and they never work with your available times or requests off.
good,nice work place fun environment great benefits awesome bosses paid time off and vacation time clean and punctual as of workplace standards would recommend
good,It was funny it had it's ups and downs with manage ment but on behalf of the working area I enjoy helping customers and providing great customer service
good,I loved working at Casey's the manager was unprofessional but the overall experience was good. The only thing I did not like is that it was mismanaged by manager.
good,"It overall was a good job and was guaranteed. It was usually pretty laid back unless you got the occasional rush. I personally enjoyed working in the kitchen more than anything, it was easy to stay busy back there and allowed time to fly by faster."
good,"Had a ball working this job. I knew my share of the every day come in and grab a coffee people. I enjoyed learning the store manager role but if i had to chose a bad thing to say, i would say this. They run their own ID checking program. so check em if they look to young."
good,great management made it a great work place. easy to understand job through training and many opportunity to excel in the workplace. many opportunity to learn different positions throughout the store.
good,"Kitchen work is hard. I knew the job was not a career choice, for very long. I was attending college classes, the job was a good choice for the various hours."
good,"hectic"
good,"A typical day consisted of making coffee for customers, cleaning, register and cleaning. I learned to work late hours as it was a 24 hour gas station and stand for long periods."
good,Always took care of me when I needed to be taken care of the most. Manager was okay but lacked some skills needed to run a business. Management was also very understanding and trusting.
good,A typical work day would be making pizza for customers and for the wormer as well as making the food for the wormer and making subs for customers at there request
good,Great place to work when I was there. We had great employees and we had fun in our job. Loved the customers as well. always had the same regulars come in every day
good,IT was fun working in a public place most of the time although stressful at times .the company encourages advancement to those interested. I enjoyed serving the customers but did not like asking for donations when we were required to .
good,"I like this kind of job there is always something to do. It make the days different and short. You have some of the daily customers but they have different attitudes daily so you become friends on a level. You stay busy so the time flies. It is a lot of cleaning, and keeping the store clean but I would not want it any other way from somewhere I would shop or get food from."
good,"This was my first job and it was a great place to work. Everybody liked working there and though it doesn't pay much more than McDonald's it doesn't have the stigma of ""working at McDonald's."""
good,"This job is pretty easy going yet fast paced as well. So much fun and I enjoy the customers. If you are a people person, this is the job for you. I would recommend it"
good,"I enjoyed the gas station type work, tasks were fairly easy closing and opening the store were also pretty easy they also provided me with key holder privages which i liked"
good,a day of work consists of taking orders and making pizzas or sub sandwiches for customers to there preference plus cleaning and running register the hardest part of the job is keeping up when you receive an abundance of orders and the enjoyable part is working with other employees and customers.
good,"My typical day of work consists of managing the kitchen as a food service leader. I worked all different kind of shifts, and each shift had a certain job. I multitasked a lot. I get my job done. sometimes I wouldn't get a day off due to lack of staff. I'm not going to lie, it was very stressful for my lifestyle. It was always fast paced and get things done which I have never had a problem not getting something done. Any free time I got I've spent thinking how to make my kitchen, the Casey's kitchen look better, cleaned, etc."
good,working the kitchen was very fast paced at times and a lot of fun. loved working out front on the register was a great change of pace. last manager I had was very unpleasant but loved my original hiring manager
good,"I wrote schedules, maintained staffing to provide excellent customer service. Managed inventory, maintained profitability for the company. I worked all shifts and learned all equipment"
good,Caseys has a wonderful work environment.The Coworkers are great to work with.Good place to jump start a career.Always diiferent opptines working with the company.
good,loved this job because the manager I had at the time was very flexible with my schedule do to me being enrolled in school. It worked great for me at the time because I  as able to focused on my school work more.
good,"just not the place for me, I used to work there several years ago but found out just wasn't where I wanted to be now. I had more set hours last time I worked there  so my schedule was balanced and I knew what I would work everyday and week to week, Now hours were all scrambled and not sure of what you would work or when you had off and it just didn't work with my familys schedule  we all work at different times and need a more secure schedule"
good,Working here was a good way to get to know people in the neighborhood. Working the  register in a small town gas station was very friendly and great opportunity to get to know the town.
good,Best baked goods in champaign county. I really enjoy the customers and management. Excellent flexibility with scheduling and holiday rotation. Also a excellent chain for relocation.
good,"I worked at Casey's throughout my high school and college days and I really liked it for the most part. You get to work and meet a lot of different people, as well as get a discount on breakfast pizza! Who doesn't love that?!"
good,"My typical day includes making pizzas, ringing up customer's purchases and cleaning the store. I've learned a lot about customer service and food production, and I've made some valuable friendships with my coworkers. I enjoy it very much."
good,I loved working with Caseys as night baker. I had a great management. Flexible scheduling. Fair pay. Overall good management. It was a fun experience and very educational.
good,"Casey's is a wonderful company to work for, in fact, I worked for this company on three different occasions, as an only job and as a second job. You were allotted plenty of time to finish your work, regular breaks and lunch time, where food bought at the store was discounted. There were opportunities for individuals to grow with the company if they chose. "
good,Pretty much left alone in the kitchen to do your own thing. Fast paced. Easily manageable. Stays busy enough that you are always with something to do. Never a dull moment.
good,Casey's is a fun and non stressful job. The hardest part of the job was probably making the pizza's but even though it was hard to catch on to it was still fun. Great starting job.
good,"Being a part of the community during good times and bad times, working with the customers, adding to pleasantness of their day, and using my organizational skills to manage employees and being responsible for keeping order in the store."
good,"Busy and always meeting new people. The time went by fast and I always knew when gas would go on sale, Kind people I worked with and I got to take home leftovers."
good,"Casey's is a nice atmosphere but very fast paced. I was fired for not being fast enough. You don't feel secure from day 1 in any job. You need to be extremely fast and accurate and able to multi task if you want to work here,"
good,Very clean and very nice people to work with. Bosses help to teach you in a reasonable manner but dont stand over your shoulder either. Like working with the public and seeing new faces every day.
good,"Loved working at Casey's..... My coworkers were fun to work with, store manager was a bit difficult to please but otherwise good. The customers were the best part of my shifts, always came in with a smile & willing to chit chat about anything. I enjoyed learning my position as cashier...."
good,It was a great place to work! I wish I could have continued working longer than the year that I was there but I loved every bit of working here! The staff was like my family!
good,kfc was my first job and i did like it. A good job because i was the only cook so alot of hard working. Teamwork was good because it is always good to have that. Well managed very good ran business
good,"I have plenty of kitchen experience and so this job came as second nature to me. I really liked my co-workers, and the work was pretty easy. Shortly after I started working here, my girlfriends home of 10 years was sold and the new owners weren't going to sign a lease with us because they wanted to do a bunch of renovations so we had to re-locate, which we were planning on doing, but wanted to save up more money first and pay off some bills."
good,"Everyday was busy. Some things were daily duties, others were constantly changing. Loved my job. I had a lot of friends there."
good,"First Job in high school, co-workers were nice, standing on feet for 8 hours a day with no seating. Learned to count down till, and control money, and watch for pumps"
good,During my time at Casey's I quickly moved up the corporate ladder. As a fast learner and dependable worker I was able to gain a promotion into management after only 9 months on the job. Casey's is an excellent company to work for that strives to make customer service a priority and trains employees to be the very best at what they do. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the people I met on a daily basis. It's nice when someone comes in and you are able to call them by name and vice versa. I would recommend the company to anyone looking for a great career.
good,management in shelbyville is good except for the kitchen that lady is rude i hated that i never got any hours this is more of a teens job not an adult with bills
good,I loved that I had a very good boss. the workers are all very friendly. even though it could be hectic the workers always maneged to keep a smile on our faces!
good,"My co-workers became some of my best friends in just 1 week. Lots of fun regular customers. Pay isn't too bad. Because my co-workers and I worked so great as a team, the store ran very smooth."
good,Caseys is a wonderful environment to work in. You can learn to be efficient in your work and how to deal with customers face to face.
good,"worked for few years. had a lot of issues with family and my health went to heck. got let go due to that. but it is a good place to work,"
good,"I love working here, great people. Although I worked in a small store the atmosphere is great. Everyone is always positive and the customers enjoy coming into our store."
good,"Casey's is a one stop shop. It has a full kitchen, gas and carwash, and grocery store. I started off in the kitchen and worked my way up to 2nd Assistant Manager.  It was a friendly environment to work in, the people were great."
good,It a high energetic job with great people and the best pizza and customer services every day is different You have a lot responsible and tons of cleaning but you make good friends with boss and coworkers
good,I was learning how to do truck orders for our merchandise. I learned the pizza making and kitchen. but my fave part of caseys was working up front with the customers. having a smile on your face always seem to make the customer smile even when there day wasn't going right.
good,I really enjoyed working at Casey's General Store However the scheduling was kind of difficult to do due to the fact that one associate has to relieve the next and everyone isn't dependable. but their under new management so maybe things has change.overall its not a bad company
good,I would go from cash register and cooking every body was so nice it was a great work expairce it was a goodish job but at the same time I hated it
good,"Busy workplace, knew all positions available to me and worked to my fullest potential. Was part-time but often worked more than full-time hours. Coworkers were fun to be around and got lots of pizzas out the door, while keeping a happy atmosphere."
good,"A typical day at work would include coming in and preparing the store to open, completing paperwork from the night before and getting it sent off, running register, checking in vendors, placing orders as needed, and handling any escalated customer concerns."
good,"Customer service ,data entry, stocking products, helping co workers, and checking on gas. Hardest part of the day is angry customers. And most enjoyable part of the day was customer service."
good,Day to day is always different depending on the people that come in to the store. I learned how to multitask in order to be able to meet demands and keep customer happy and willing to return. The management is willing to work just as hard as the rest of the employees to keep up with the workload of the business. The coworkers are fun and exciting to work with all with their own personalities. The hardest part of the job is getting everything done according to the guidelines with out making mistakes. The most enjoyable part of the job having to deny someone their purchases when they have small children and their card declines.
good,"Use great customer service and take care of any problems that arise."
good,"customer service daily with great co-workers, easy pay to stock selves, hardest part is truck day, great management team"
good,"On a typical day all I did was make pizza orders and keep the warmer stocked up with food for the customers. My co-workers were friends, funny, but at the same time hard-working. I learned how to work a register. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to take a break anytime as long as your job was all caught up."
good,"I started as a cashier and was moved to produce.  I enjoyed helping the produce manager stock shelves and inform customers of our products.  I unloaded the truck, which included heavy lifting and spending a good amount of time in the cooler.  I also took over the manager duties, such as ordering the truck, when the manger was unavailable to do so.  I also worked in several other departments as help was needed."
good,"Working at Casey's, I started at the bottom.  I found that I thrived in this work environment and successfully climbed my way to the position I wanted.  I greatly enjoyed working in a fast paced position and loved the customer interaction.  It was nice to be the person that everyone came to when things went wrong and with questions about the job.  I learned patience and understanding as well as how to be a manger and still be on a level that all of my co-workers could relate to.  The hardest part about this job would be the day I had to leave this job.  I can only hope that I find a job in my future that I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed being a manager at Casey's."
good,"Typically I ran register up until I become management then I did those things on top of running the register."
good,It was okay the coworkers were fun to be around. i ended up leaving due to me moving to St. Louis MO
good,"Applied for this position as a way to make extra money.  Thoroughly enjoy the solitary environment for the first 1/2 of the shift as well as baking.  "
good,the people who I worked with were all easy to get along with and fun to be around.
good,"When I worked at Casey's Gas Station I really enjoyed meeting the customers and being able to assist their needs and welcome them to come back an shop at Casey's. Another thing I really enjoyed was the work enviroment, my coworkers made every work day enjoyable!"
good,"Smooth going days with wonderful people. "
good,I liked working at Casey's the customers loved the food that brought back regular customers that was fun. The managers have a good sense of humor and are great motivators when that is needed.
good,Fun place to work if you have nothing better to do!!! Doesnt offer full time unless your management. Working nights is the best..
good,"You get to work with the public and assist them in anyway possible. "
good,Fun workplace interacting with customers to please there needs. Nice to be a team and all of us(co-workers) work together and help one another out.
good,"Working at Casey's Food Store began my experience with the ""public"". I learned how to develop positive professional relationships with customers and co-workers. Being in high school while employed at Casey's, the supervisor worked around my school schedule to allow my employment, which was very helpful and kind."
good,great job to work for because employees are nice and friendly. An great environment to work in.
good,"completed new tasks quickly and learned them well, love my job meeting new people and easy going work enviroment"
good,"Great place to work. Hardest part of job, being over the road."
good,Friendly enviroment including great managers! But there were always favorites just like any other job
good,"I leanred how to become a store manager.  My duties included payroll, scheduling, cooking, and over running of the store."
good,"It is a very fast paced environment, where we constantly multi-tasking. I have learned so much at this job and how to operate different machines such as lotto/lottery, credit and debit...etc. My co workers, although we are all very different, got along great, we are all still friends today. The hardest part of the job was to keep an eye on the customers at the gas pumps...some would leave without paying. The most enjoyable was meeting new people."
good,"started working then no training for over nights had to learn as I went .had to run register.Clean store with any train on how to do had to learn from mistakes. When talking to manager was told to just ask if had problem but,when tried to ask questions told to handle it .Co workers getting promotions.Was told I was doing a good job but,needed to stay on over nights.Hardes part was getting use to over nights."
good,Exciting place to work . Many friendly faces on a day to day basis. Clean workplace with flexible schedules .
good,"learned how to cook in a kitchen,got along great with everyone.hardest part of job was the customers.i enjoyed the people i worked with"
good,This is what I did everyday when I got to work. I would wait on customers and make pizza.The Management was great to work with. My co-workers were also great to work with.
good,Busy from 5am til I left usually around 3pm always deealing with vendors and great customers. While employed with Casey's I learned team work is what makes the job happen.I was the manager I was not friends with my employees while at work I was their boss and I did not enteract with them much out of the work place either it was not allowed per Casey's. The hardest part of my job being the store manager was finding reliable people that wanted to work and weren't just there for a pay check. My customers were the best part of my job I get along with everyone but keep it professional.
good,You get to interact with people while still doing your everyday duties.
good,I was an office manager for an ebay store ... I manged one or two other employes.
good,"I learned a lot working at casey's such as how to use computerized registers, how to use a food stamps machine, how to count down the safe etc. A typical day for me was doing my shift work and waiting on my many customers. My co-workers were great! They we're all always positive and very helpful. The hardest part of my job was learning how to make pizza's right. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be my customers. A lot of them we're very friendly and a few actually became social with me outside of work."
good,talking to customers on the phone and taking their orders. how to make all different kinds of pizzas. Management is great. My coworkers are fun and nice working with. They are very supportive. Dealing with difficult people. Making pizzas and the customers.
good,"Customers would constantly come in and I was always willing to help them. Management was very nice, I went to college with her. I enjoyed all of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was having to go out in the winter. The most enjoyable was the customers that came in."
good,For all of the work that is required they dont pay you nearly enough. Management doesnt listen to their workers. If you have a family it would be best to find somewhere better that can financially accommodate you.
good,If you can handle the costumers then you got it. Its not a hard job other than standing on your feet for your whole shift. Must be polite and friendly even if you have a mean or mad costumer. Just remember the costumer is always right. I would definitely go back to work here if they are hiring.
good,It was ok. It honestly could've been better. I really miss the Augusta store. They knew how to work together. The Douglass location was not a place I'd want to go. No teamwork or sense of responsibility.
good,"Fast paced work, good training. Only negative is the lack of communication from management. Free drinks and 50 percent off food while on the clock. Overall decent place to work.Love my boss, great , great products, tons of training, willingness to help each other, paid holidays and vacation and sick hours, support my organization Loved working here would definitely go back if i was giving more hours  I would most definitely recommend anyone that would like to work at a casey's store."
good,"A typical day at Casey's would consist of making dough for pizzas, stocking all pizza ingredients, making donuts, applying icing and decorations to donuts.  I also had to make breakfast and lunch sandwich's and other types of food.  I also had to work the sub sandwich bar and make those for customers as needed. I learned a lot about food preparation.  Restocking all food products continuously as well as take orders over phone, in person, or via website was a must as well.  The hardest part about this job was that it was so fast paced. Sometimes it was difficult to keep up.  But that was also my favorite because it kept me busy and my shift went by fast."
good,"They take good care of their employees. They give you a discount while on the clock, plenty of opportunities to move up within the company, and lots of benefits for full time employees."
good,Customers are very understanding and they turn it into a friendly environment to be. Your employees are very helpful and will become your friends more than employees.
good,"overall good experience, close to home  Family atmosphere.   Not much room for advancement.  I enjoyed working with the outside consultants, and co workers"
good,It starts out ok but then you realize the favoritism.  The play favorites.  They give you bad shifts if they don't like you even if your a hard worker.
good,Fast paced environment with Friendly and loyal customers. All job responsibilities are easily carried out during your shift. The upper management leaves alot to be desired in this particular location.
good,"Enjoyed working for Caseys, at the time I was not able to be available for as many hours and shifts I wanted, as I was also taking care of an elderly lady in her home.  Because of that, I was only allowed to work certain days between certain hours.  I have no limitations on how many hours or shifts I am available."
good,I love the people I work with there is some I wish would quit. I love the fast pace makes the day go by faster. Wish we had different food for morning
good,"All corporations are out for their money. Let's drop the act and be honest. The point of a corporation existing is to get money and to keep people coming back. That said, the General Store Manager at Casey's was a delight to be around and she was very friendly and nice. I had a pleasant time working here but the rate of pay was less than desirable, although most corporations will not pay you what your time is worth."
good,"While I enjoy working at Casey's, its not a long term option for me. I need a full time job with more consistent hours. But they are wonderful there, trying to work around people schedules. I started back in college and I am a single mom. As long as you work hard and prove your trying, our manager is great about working with you."
good,"Casey's was a great company to work for, but sadly I had to leave to pursue other opportunities, and my mental health was failing, but the staff and management were very understandable."
good,It can discouraging trying to find employment when your criminal background is stopping you. Casey's General Store will not hold your criminal history against you even if your currently on probation or parole.
good,This was a part time job for me. I enjoyed all the people that I worked with. The managers should have much better training. It seems like every store does things different.
good,it can be very face paced at time then at time its slow. but there is always something to do if you looked around. The customer interaction is always fun.
good,"This job taught me how to deal with cash registers, basic preparations for food and store needs. I also learned how to deal with reporting incidents, and issues with customers to management, and law enforcement."
good,I liked it but we didnt have management . The employees were awesome . The manager we had left for another store so trying to get fill ins it was a mess
good,I enjoyed working at Casey's because the employees were very nice and respectful and the customers were as well. It also taught me many basic work experience skills.
good,"If your looking for a fun, customer friendly , fast paced environment this is the place for you. If you are willing to work hard Thsm this is the place for you."
good,"On a normal day ,it starts out slow then is steady. It is a lot to learn at first but once u get the hang of it it's easy. The hardest part of the job is to deal rude customers, but other than that the job is fun and so are the customers."
good,"Learned how to make sub sandwiches, had to learn different types and the meats and cheeses, dressings to use.  Co-workers were great, friendly.  Try to get all the work done that they told you to do.  Hardly got a one time ten minute break. Hours I worked were great."
good,"typical day at work was decent when you catch everybody on a good day, other wise the mood was set from the manager and mostly negative. hardest part of the job was the emotional environment, most enjoyable part of the day was to see multiple customers throughout the day and to begin making their day or even ending a good night. the lack of communication around the job was defying."
good,Its just a fun place to work. The store i worked at took pride in how well put together the store is and how friendly we were.
good,"I loved my job, i went to work every day. I also enjoyed my employees. became very close with my working partners. loved the fast pace enviorment when it was rush hour. had a respectable boss until their was a misunderstanding on my application."
good,I loved working at caseys. It was a fast paced environment which allowed us to accomplish tasks. Working as a team was one of my favorite parts. This allowed the store to reflect a team effort instead of just the hard work of one individual
good,The most enjoyment was conversating with all the customers about what was going on. They all new me by name it felt like a family.
good,"I loved working there, great place, great staff, great management. Great environment, the store is clean, food is made on time. Always fresh. Customer service is phenomenal. Everyone is always so nice and helpful."
good,Boss should be more nicer to stuff and should help more. We could use more help on the weekends teamwork is falling apart hours are being cut.things have changed where stuff don't care an customers stopped coming in.on different times or just changed location of the store where they shop
good,Good coworkers. Flexible hours. Easy work. Decent pay for working at a gas station. Good work environment. Small town business and people. Everyone is easy to get along with.
good,"Crew is the best. Manager and assistant were so helpful and i will miss greatly. I enjoyed "
good,I love meeting new people and enjoy working in gas station because you meet many different people. The work environment it is a great place and so is management.
good,I had fun but got blackballed in the end the management was great until the switched up people i ran the store all by myself for 7 months and was promised a position just to find out they werent going to give it to me
good,"Tasks include; if it needs done- do it! Customer servive and small restaurant.  Managing cash registers, inventory, orders, cooking & kitchen duties, cleaning, customer satisfaction & complaints and unloading truck delivery."
good,"Great job working with customers in a face paced environment!  Stocked shelves, unloaded trucks, assisted customers, operated cash register and performed food preparation."
good,"Love working there had to relocate would go back if there was one close enough. Great people, attitudes, great food. The manager are excellent. Wish the pay was higher for everything i do there."
good,This is one of those jobs I liked at first. But then I was the only one working all the hours when someone called in. But when I called off I had to find my own replacement. That was my manager's fault. Not the company. She no longer works for them. But I will say I loved working for the company itself.
good,Loved the crew  everyone was like family it wasn’t too hard easy going job great hours and great pay managers are great and the location is also great
good,Casey's is a relaxed job. Employees are very friendly and work together well to complete tasks for the shift and to help keep the store clean. Caseys also provides many products on sell for a convenient store
good,"It was a very good job to work at until we got a new boss she changed everything. She always thought she was right about everything we would be out of something and she would sit in the office and hide so all the cashiers would have to take the blame for being out of something. When you would try to help her she would argue saying she was right with what she was doing. I tried my best to stick it out as long as could at the job because I really did grow to love the customers and my co workers they were all great people I do miss them, but the stress from that place was not worth it anymore."
good,This is a busy convenience store. Time management and excellent customer service is a must. You also need to be a TEAM PLAYER in order for smooth and effective work place.
good,Great place to work if you like interacting with customer face to face. Very busy and truck days demanding but rewarding and trying.  Good people to work with.
good,"Fast paced retail environment in a small town location, varied hours including weekends. Enjoyed working with a diverse population in a small community."
good,I learned at work you need to make sure you have all the food and coffee ready when all the works came in for the morning rush. and always had back up plans. I would get there at 5:30am -2:30pm and would make sure coffee was made and stuff was stocked and ready for the morning crew and the lunch was ready for the lunch crew. I loved it there
good,Great work environment.  Well managed and attention to associates personal life for work/home life balance.  Quick financial decisions are mandatory and great customer service is essential.
good,What I liked most about working there was that they pretty much do everything by the book. I started out as donut maker and soon advanced to cashier and then assistant manager. It was a fast paced job.Enjoyed working with the public. It was hard to get off nights and weekends.
good,"loved it when worked as a group but people will sabotage you to get ahead in life. Loved my managers, they communicated and promptly. When team worked together shift ran smoothly."
good,"Good place to work. Nice people, and great setup. Great store manager and great employees. I loved the graveyard shift. Got to help people with products and serve them with great customer service."
good,I loved working here. i think if i had to choose out of all the work history that this was the best job  that i had. My management was wonderful. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the orders but its fast paced.
good,I enjoyed my time working a Casey's. i enjoyed the variety of food we had. i enjoyed the Casey's staff and management as well. i wold recommend Casey's to a friend.
good,"I loved working at this Caseys General store. We had a great team at the time, and even though some days were more stressful than others we all seemed to manage to pull together to make a stressful work day a fun one."
good,It was a one person owner.  5 to 6 employees only.  Great day and hours. Nice workers. Educated myself on a lot of stuff I never knew how to do. Good environment
good,"Decent enough place to work for, though they hire in a lot of inexperienced kids. The job itself is very simple and the customers were generally decent people. Overall it is not the worst place to work for."
good,I loved working at Casey's because I have lived in the town since I was a little girl. I knew most of the customers from being active in the community for many years. I have children that are in the school district and so that helped with knowing a lot of the parents and in the summer time knowing the kids as they came into the store with out parents. A typical day at work would consist of laughs along with keeping up with the routine of jobs. I loved my co workers I got along with everyone that I worked with. Management was easy to work with  they listened to complaints and concerns and were awesome problem solvers.
good,"Really enjoyed the people I worked with.would have loved to move up in this company but do to the need to move to FL made it to ware i could not. "
good,"Good food from pizza to tenderloins.  Convince at your fingertips. The workers are friendly, coffee made every hour. Food made every hour. Gas n drinks ( hot or cold). Pizzas made to order however you want it."
good,"My typical day when working the 2-11pm shift was always smooth going. My duties were as follows. Customer service,running a cash register,cleaning,stocking of product,the closing down of the store. On a day like the weekends I would go in to the store around 3:30am start baking all the donuts,cookies ect. At about 5am I would start the daily books for the store,count the safe,add up checks,enter daily planners for the corp. office. At 6am I would open the store finishing up the daily books while taking care of customer,do a cigarett count, beer stock count, go over store inventory,go to the bank and make deposits. In this job I learned that I can do just about anything as long as I put my mind to it. My co-workers were great to work with and be around every one pitched in their fair share to make sure the store ran smoothly. The most enjoyable thing about this job was the customers that you would see daily and get to know."
good,"Some of the workers there were'nt to great but the job was good. I liked working there, i just could'nt being at high risk during my pregnacy, but if i had the chance to get the job back again I would take it."
good,"My skills just weren't  being used.  Nice place and great people to work with, just that I wanted to keep moving on in skills."
good,"I have learned not to become person with employees, way to much gossip in the workplace. Went through 3 managers while i was employed. This became a bit harder as new members moved up the chain and some who really had the experience didn't get a second look."
good,I loved the customers and co-workers everyone was understanding and very inviting to new employees. The hard part was you are on your feet for long periods at a time and sometimes never got a break.
good,"Pleasant co-workers, hilarious customers, small town location. Hardest part is when carry out orders come back to back for 2 hours and you still have to make warmer food every hour plus all of the carry out orders within a certain amount of time, can be challenging but fun at the same time. Management is willing to help you out if you need help."
good,I enjoyed seeing my regular customers on a daily basis they were all sad to see me leave. It was always a pleasure making people smile and seeing my co-workers. The store was always kept in great maintenance for our area Manager Merle.
good,"I would open the store. I would make the pizzas and donuts. I would clean my work station, stock the cooler and ice machine."
good,Scheduled employee's work. Managed and trained all employees on a daily basis.
good,I had a great time at Caseys an spent so many years there - was my first real job an taught me so much - however uppoer management would steal an management was doing things they weren't supposed to do plus not enough training
good,"I took orders over phone, prepared pizza and other food items. I also made pizza dough, stocked cooler, and cleaned dishes and work area. I would relieve cashier for break when needed."
good,I miss this job cause it has such a live culture that surrounds the store
good,"Steady schedule, basic customer servce skills needed. Management lacks the duty needed to improve the company and overall company values and core "
good,"I have loved working with Caseys the last year and a half, I actually get excited to go to work and be around so many fun people that have become more like family."
good,This place is a great place to work. Variety of positions available. Fast paced and on demand. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff and customers. Great family!
good,It was a joy to work at Casey's. I must I had one of the best managers that I have ever experienced. She was hard-working and pushed us to be as success as possible.
good,"My job really consisted of staying busy, either with my customers or maintenance. Most of the time my shift flew by I think mainly because I didn't have an issue finding somwas the first time I kept up with an inventory list, I did have an issue e kind of task to keep myself occupied even after completing my maintenance check list. This remembering what to document during training but I caught on pretty quick. I really appreciated the fact that if I did have any problems my manager was an excellent with giving straight to the point directions. My biggest issue was definitely just getting motivated during early morning shifts but after I got the hang of a regular schedule and routine everything worked out great. I can't say I had any specific duties I really enjoyed the most, really I adored my job completely."
good,"Starting off here, there was a lot to take in working in the kitchen but by the end of my second month on the job, I had pretty much everything down packed. Wonderful staff and appreciative customers keep the work day moving."
good,It’s a very nice environment to work in.  You are guaranteed to have a great day and not leave in a bad mood.  The management is amazing and very helpful.
good,"Normal day customer complaints, employee complaints. Daily management duties, overseeing production numbers, ensuring quality control. Inventory control."
good,Working at Casey's General Store was a great experience. I loved my customers; especially the regulars. It was hard work for me most days as my job duties were much more than just being a cashier.
good,Great place to work with tons of overall experience and stuff to learn as you go. Some days are fast and hard work while some days are a little more relaxed
good,This company is very reliable with many opportunities for advancement. I do think managers do not get paid fairly. They do a lot of work for low pay. It is a company I would reccomend working for because they do take in everyone's ideas and give opportunities for advancement.
good,"Management was unfair most of the time. I was never late and never called off, worked enough hours for my lifestyle but if any busier it probably would not have been a good fit. Overall it was a good job and I enjoyed the company and the people I worked with."
good,The customers are normally great that come in to Casyes. Respectful and have a smile on their face. The other employees are great people to work with. The hours can get long.
good,I dont have any comment on or about working at Casey's General store at this time due to not working there long enough and not spending alot of time there
good,"Overall the job was prettt easy and the people i worked with were cool, most of the time it was even kind of fun to be at work. Paid 10 an hour to make pizza and clean things up. I thought it was s good part time job."
good,I enjoyed working at Casey's General store. My hours was awesome and i only worked 4 days a week and still had my 40 hrs.i loved the customers and most people i worked with .one of the asst.managers was very difficult and not understanding but the other manager was super great. I would work there in a heartbeat if they would hire me back
good,"I love working for Casey's. I enjoy the multiple areas I can work in and that is fast paced. I do however, wish that there was more disciplinary actions given to those who don't follow rules."
good,"Pizza maker is very fun, I loved feeling like i had control of the kitchen. Doughnut making was fun and they really taught me how to make good to the best of my ability."
good,"I work a minimum of nine hours a day, but on average its closer to 10 hours a day. It's fast paced and you are always meeting new people. The hardest part of the job is reading people, to weed out the bad applicants and always being on call."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with flexible hours and friendly faces, and of course making their famous pizza from scratch is an interesting experience."
good,This is a great place to work for those entering college. Depending on who you get for a manager they can work with you on your schedule a lot. Very comfortable.
good,Fun and fast paced.  Management is nice enough. Fair scheduling and all that. Always something to do. Some variety with the job. Different shifts including overnight.
good,"Good job for working college students."
good,"I work nights so its pretty quiet, slow paced. I stock, clean, take cigarette inventory and count out drawers for the following shifts. I enjoy working with the public and meeting new people so its an awesome place to work. I wouldn't be leaving if it weren't for me relocating at the end of the month to South Beloit, I have put in numerous transfers. Just waiting to hear something back. I also gave my awesome manager over 4 weeks notice I was leaving so she could find a replacement."
good,Casey's is perfect because it has a little bit of something for anyone. It was the perfect balance of quick-paced and laid back so I never felt pressured to get too much done in too short of a time. The management cares about their employees and was very flexible in scheduling.
good,"This job involves greeting and caring for customers whether by register or kitchen. This job can teach you great math skills, time management, and social skills. Managers vary from store to store, but for the most part a easy to work with. Keeping both customers and coworkers happy as well as time management can be challenging. The most enjoyable part is the laid back atmosphere and serving people with a smile"
good,I just wish they gave higher raises. For example. I have been working for the company for 4 years and still make less than 11 dollars an hour. The starting wage is 10.
good,Everyday was something new. I loved the people I worked with and the customers that came in whether it be regulars or newcomers the atmosphere was always nice. I also liked the diversity in work it provided and management was always helpful.
good,"I love working for caseys, I just have to find a job that has better pay for my family. The store I am in the manager is amazing. She is by far the best boss I have ever had. She always working so hard to do the best she can. I wantvto say caseys is lucky to have her."
good,"Fun environment, great pay, the shifts are nice and short, employee discount, managers are willing to help you out if needed, good benefits, all around a good place to work!"
good,"I had no difficulties quickly moving from part tine sub maker to Assistant Store Manager. With the exception of moving to a different town. However, training was rushed. And the hours expected were outrageous. I did not work under 70 hours any week after I was promoted. The supervisor was confrontational and never once encouraging. My Store Manager was amazing and tried his best to give me the training needed, but company policy did not budget that in and he was under staffed to begin with. I liked working for Caseys most days. However when I took the promotion nothing was mentioned about being required to close the store most night and open every other weekend. As a single mother this was not oractical and I never seen my children."
good,Pay rate is a little low for sustaining an individual. The work is what you would expect from the daily operations of a gas station. In general my coworkers and management were friendly and helpful.
good,I enjoyed my job at Casey's. I would either run the cash register or work in the back making pizzas or doughnuts. I learned that you do have to watch your back because there are some people who are out to get others in trouble unfortunately. I enjoyed working with my manager and other co-workers. I never got wrote up or called in without prior ok in the three years I worked there. The hardest part of the job was working night shift and attending school full time. I had to give it up for the last semester of school because of 7 classes and 20 hours interning each week didn't leave much time with two boys at home. I enjoyed my co-workers so I would say that getting to see them and the customers each day was the enjoyable part.
good,Very busy work shifts. But overall a very good company to start with as a first time job. Learn many skills while on the job.
good,"Customers at the store and employees were great. The manager told me that she didn't like me, and she significantly cut my hours...and that's why I left. The hardest part of the job was learning how to take apart machinery and put it back together. The most enjoyable part was dealing with the customers."
good,"Casey's corporate office isn't the typical corporate force that just pays lip-service to being ""family-oriented"" when it comes to their employees. They legitimately care about you and your well-being, and so long as you communicate with your manager, they'll work with you to make sure your schedule allows for the time you need to support and care for your family in more ways than just bringing home a paycheck."
good,I generally loved working there  my coworkers  and managers were awesome  pay was acceptable  and it was a short walk from my apartment every single day
good,"Love my job! Friendly, fun place to be.. Coworkers are great - they like to have fun, but ensure the job tasks are also completed. Definite room for advancement."
good,It is a good place to learn new skills and have fun doing it in a people friendly atmosphere.  Flexable hrs nice people fast past enviroment. Good pay and benefits avalible.
good,"Get annual reviews.  Pay raises aren't good at all.  Not a bad place to work for a second income.  They want you to be diverse and help each department as needed.  You are not recognized for that.  They call you in frequently on your days off.  You would have to be there many, many years before you could even get a dollar an hour raise. Sick and vacation time available for full time employees.  Insurance is pricey"
good,"Casey's is a well run company, management works well with everyone to make sure that all aspects of the stores run well.  Most of my day was spent on the register ringing customers up.  I did not get a lot of time away from the register to do more managerial things which is stressful but was able to accomplish them just not in the timeframe I set for myself."
good,"Start your day with book work, move to customer service, move to kitchen work.  Never a slow moment.  Each day keeps you busy and is rewarding.  I hire the best team and they make each day awesome."
good,I got this job while I was still a senior is high school. I kept it until I left to serve in the Marine Corps so that I had money to cover the few bills I had before I left.
good,The other team members and managers were great to work with. The only thing I would have changed is maybe a little more pay and a few more people It was a lot of fun working there I just found a job that paid more and had better hours.
good,"Very fast pace and demanding position to include: cooking, cashier, light maintenance, bathroom attendant. Multi task position for everyone. Customers was very delightful to meet everyday."
good,enjoyed working in the one in Columbus .  the manager there is very understanding and worked with you if you had family problems. I also worked with one in Salina Kansas and the manager there to was helpful with family issues and both was grateful to their employees.
good,"Overall good job, fun employees, pay was decent, management was very flexible, great pizza, treated employees great with breaks could take one whenever it wasn't busy"
good,It was a good job for the time being. I worked in the kitchen. We would always be short people. We were not paid enough for the responsibilies we had. The manager did not do her part at all.
good,I love caseys. The environment is great. The people are easy to work with. The customers are very friendly. And over all I miss working there. I would definitely recommend Casey's for employment.
good,"Would work here again, loved making pizzas and the atmosphere.. Was just a job to make a little extra pocket change. Very relaxed, fun. Loved interacting with the customers."
good,Working for this company made me proud and confident in what I did.  I was able to keep moving up with company and took every opportunity handed to train in new things.  Wish I could be back with the family.
good,Miss working with supervisor and employees.  Customers were awesome.  Fun fast paced environment.  Vendors very helpful and understanding during peak hours.  Food was amazing.
good,I kept getting write ups for stuff that I wouldn't do. I had proof that it wasn't my handwriting and still got wrote up. The store manager was kinda rude but she was nice to.
good,"If you are a college student looking for a part time or temporary position, Casey's General Store is a great place to work. Two weeks of paid training; you do not need experience."
good,I enjoyed my time with Casey's General Store. It was an experience ill take with me throughout my life. I enjoyed working my way to management along with the team I had to upkeep company policies.
good,I would show up about 5:45am and count my drawer and clock in. then iwould get the coffee started for the customers. Then at 6am i would unlock doors.. smile and great the customes with a bright smile. the hardest part i say would of been around lunch rush hour i would get swamped with customers and i was the only cashieropen i still kept a smile on my face through it all.
good,"Casey's is a great company to work for.  They sell very good products at competitive prices.  They are fair to their employees, and give them many chances before terminating them for wrong doing.  The hardest part of the job is not finding good help.  If you have kids or a family, you are never home.  I was paid salary, so working 60+ hours a week was very exhausting with no reward.  They started a nice incentive plan for the employees.  They did offer discounted food and free fountain drinks. I really enjoyed most of the customer interaction and I do miss them now that I am gone."
good,Caseys is a great place to work if you like being around the public. They make sure you are trained correctly and will help when there are areas needing improvement
good,"Working at Caseys has been a fun and educational. I have learned many things in my three years of working here, it is a place where i feel comfortable being myself and doing what i am good at."
good,This company was awesome to work for the only thing I was disappointed in was the benefits and pay it pays a little lower then most jobs in the same retail class. The benefits were not as good as expected. I made more for a company 10 years earlier called Holiday station stores being a assistant manager then here. Definitely under payed especially how long some of the people had worked there.
good,"They really work with you to accommodate the needs of your at home life, friendly people, good place to get job experience, they are not afraid to train you"
good,It's a great place to work and I enjoyed it! Friendly people and staff and great management really help you feel you belong! I would recommend this job for anyone who is starting out of high school or looking for something part time to add as a second job.
good,A very fun place to work. Very sociable co-workers and amazing customers. Stressful on the busiest nights but other than that pretty laid back and all around a good place to work
good,"It was okay to work with but the manager of the store was the best manager that i ever worked for. The manager was very friendly, a person can tell that she cared about her employees."
good,The culture was amazing along with the environment. Enjoyed every aspect except for one manager. The hours could have been more steady. Usually happy and friendly.
good,The part I loved about working at Caseys was the regular customers! My co workers were another plus always so warm and smiling. It was a positive work environment.
good,"I had nothing but great experiences working for this company and the wonderful people in galva,IL. I had a great boss, who understood I had a family and when I needed to be home with my sick children, they offered fast shift replacement and didn't make me feel horrible for having to miss work, and even offered a chance to make up lost hours! Couldn't have worked for a better company! Foods great, customer service is down to earth!"
good,Excellent management. Short staffed. Great work environment. Very fast paced with large volume. Need more comprehensive training for new employees. Overall great job
good,I loved working at Casey's because of the customers and my co-workers. Mamagement was fine as long as you did your job correctly and effiently. Depending on what shift was worked there would be many differently personalities coming through the door.
good,I started at Casey's when my son was in kindergarten. It gave me a little extra money and benefits with part time hours. The flexibility to go on field trips and be a active parent in school activity's.
good,"I really enjoyed my job overall. The hours were early morning so it allowed for a full day of other things. The customers were my favorite part, they really enjoyed the atmosphere."
good,"The hours were flexible, which was lovely. The workplace itself was demanding of an organised mind and a capacity to handle crunch time in the kitchen. The manager was a very understanding individual and a great provider of an equal workplace."
good,Great place to work. Very friendly and tries to work around your family life. I had a relative that had cancer when I worked there. The manager made sure I was off anytime I needed to.
good,There were days that I would work for the kitchen and take orders for pizzas.  Pizza and hot sandwiches had to be made for the wheel for walk in customers.  The days that I was not in the kitchen I had to work the register.  I would take care of customer needs.  Balancing the register and do all the closing things that needed to be done before going home.
good,"Casey had great food, great management, and fun co workers, the customers was awesome to. Never a dual moment there. Always coming out with new food and products for different holidays. great benefits."
good,Working for Casey's taught me a lot of things. It can either be your best job or your worst. The people at the store I worked at were very rude and disrespectful and they don't compensate their workers enough for what they do or what they have to deal with but this job is definitely a job that is a starter job.
good,"work as a team to take care of the customers and the store. fast paced, simple and easy work, fun environment. very customer oriented. occasional volunteer opportunities. career advancement opportunities."
good,"Departments do not do a great job with comunitating with other departments, which can make your job hard when you have not been informed of new changes until you get a call from an unset store employee. "
good,"A typical day starts when I put on my Casey's smock. I clock in and check in with the manager or assistant manager to find out where they need me to start out. Often times they will put me right onto a register to start ringing up people's purchases. But, other times, they will send me into the kitchen to make pizzas or help stock and clean the prep areas or ovens. "
good,"I learned how to build strong relationships with others', by opening up to customers and allowing them to do the same with you. It's important to have this strong bond, helps understand clearly what one another is looking for or needing at that given time.."
good,"Hard work gets rewared, great managers, difficult night shift customers however. Easy and fun workplace. They worked aound your schooling or any events that were coming up. Understanding managers when it comes to your children and any special events."
good,"Nice place to work, follow the rules, show up for work and do your job and everything else falls into place,  Everyone is easy to get along with, management is nice, they even joke aroung"
good,"Typical day was stocking shelves cleaning, running the cash machine, some days i'd work in the kitchen and make pizza and other food they sold. The people i worked with made it fun, even the management made the work day fun so it didn't go by slowly."
good,"The best part of my job was the customers . After a while i got to know most of them by name , and if not id recognize thier smile !! the hardest part was truck day unloading , stock/inventory .We always worked together as a team and got it done . Management was always there working right along side of us . I learned that teamwork and desire goes a long way in the work place."
good,This was a second job for me. My coworkers were great and so were the customers. I did not have many hours due to my other job but loved the atmosphere.
good,Liked my job alot. My boss was very kind when I had a difficult pregnancy. Learned alot about books and management.
good,Fun place to work. There is always something new to learn. There is always something going on and a person never has to worry about finding something to do. The best thing about this company is that they have managed to stay small town. The customers are friends and neighbors.
good,Possibly the best boss and everyone got along well and productively.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy.  Benefits were good.  A good work environment.  The hardest part was trying to get the store stocked back up and customers rang out, when by myself.  I loved the customers and the interaction that I had with them."
good,"Getting ready for breakfast and lunches, a lot of cooking, and baking, management was fun to work for, co-workers easy to talk to, the hardest part of the job was unloading trucks, everything else was easy"
good,"I would work all different shifts, when ever I was needed. But my manager Andrea was a young manager but she knew what she was doing. I loved the fact that I learned how to make pizza's and donuts. But I do have to admit that making donuts was the hardest part of my job to learn. My co-workers and I had alot of fun and we made a long lasting friendships."
good,I loved the job although the hours were long and if someone didnt show up i had to be there to fill in no matter what.
good,"loved the general store . i enjoy working graveyard shifts i am a night person , did not like hours cut"
good,"learned many skills"
good,"Good place to work, I learned so much there and the coworkers are great.The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people everyday."
good,loved seeing all the customers and having regulars come in. my co-workers were amazing and loved keeping busy.
good,I am trained in all aspects of store operation from opening to closing in both the store and kitchen. I enjoy the communication and exposure to our customers and know most of them on site. Management of our store is very effective and easy to work with. the hardest part of my job is the varying work schedule from mornings to nights during the course of the week. I really enjoy the customers and workers and the overall atmosphere of the store.
good,I enjoyed getting there early and being alone to bake the breakfast pizzas and get the donuts ready. It was my me time I called it and I was just pleased to be able to de stress myself.
good,very busy work place. always something todo. its hard to keep up with warms and taking order over phone for pizzas. otherwise is some what fun job making pizzas.
good,Some employees are lazy which makes others have to do more to keep store clean. Need to focus on good employees to hire and not just a body. Team work is key!
good,I loved this job! I knew how to do everything there except the management stuff. I loved the staff I worked with and the general manager was simply amazing. The staff werent just co workers they like family and they still are.
good,"Casey’s is a kind of fast paced work environment. So, Usually there is someone alongside to to help. They offer discounts and such for employee’s. Your Managers never ask anything more than expected. The job also offers promotions and good hours. The only bad part of the job to me is coming into a shift and the kitchen is a mess from the shift before. However that isn’t the company’s fault"
good,I worked third shift which allowed me to be crossed trained. Management was helpful with working with me on streamlining procedures to make the kitchen more efficient. There was no opportunity at the store I was employed at to move up any time soon and the benefits weren't the best but not the worst. the pay was a few dollars above minimum wage.
good,Amazing job with great people and enjoyed making and serving food also the management is a little bit of a mess because of the staff but what business doesn’t have problems
good,Workplace was fun with daily regular customers. Easy tasks to complete throughout the day. The training is tentative to make sure you know how to complete your job.
good,I enjoy my job here i just dont get paid enough for what i do. But over all the work and experancie you have with your co workers and customers is rewarding
good,"I loved working at Casey's General Store, all the staff were wonderful and the supervisors and managers were experienced at there positions. I definitely would refer a friend or relative to apply for the company."
good,It was a great company to work for. There wasnt enough staff to cover shifts. I had more hours than expected. Sometimes it was more than I could handle. But overall a great company.
good,It was fast paced and hardworking. We were nonstop and I liked that it kept me busy. The customers and employees were kind. They offered benefits and room to grow.
good,Good people to work with management is awesome do your work and you wont have any issues. Havent bought into employee benefits yet due to financial problems
good,I would love to here again. It's a good job. I just don't like to feel like I'm working as hard as I can and getting the job done but it's not enough. The manager was so mean to me sometimes I cried. I've seen her be mean to other employees too. Calling them names and throwing stuff at them.
good,I enjoyed my job loved it there the customer were great the job was easy bit steady co-worker were nice we had slow nights but usually we were pretty busy.  I would recommend the job to others
good,Caseys could get stressful because of all the pizzas orders but is also fun at the same time. Ive learned a lot about time management and paying attention to detail.
good,I feel like I wasn't informed more about my befits and insurance. I feel like we were a little underpaided as mangers. My store was always understaffed not due to the management but due to the people we were getting. They were unprofessional and took advantage of my mangers kindness and always called in or tried switching days when it was the next day so we had to scramble to find someone. Since we always seemed understaffed I took the role to take all the hours I could get when people called in or when they needed me because it got to crazy and they store started talking behind. I enjoyed it alot.
good,"Fast pace with lots of food prep. Time gos fast because theres never time your not cooking, cleaning, helping customers. Everyone is always in good spirts and always work as team"
good,"Loved working there, would do it again in a heart beat. Management was amazing! Even the District Manager was excellent at his job. Clean store and understanding management"
good,"I loved how I had regulars and knew each other by name.You would always have something to be doing. Weather it was cleaning, helping customers or filling the coolers. Hardest part of my time at Casey would have been being the only cashier open and having lines out the door."
good,"I love working there, the manager is great and does her job well, the coworker make work fun and keep things running smoothly, my job requirements are challenging everyday but reachable"
good,"They had trouble keeping a manager,  so other employees did not act ethically, and I could not be a part of that."
good,"I was only planning on staying for a clue months and ended up staying for four years! Mostly because that management was so amazing. It's was pretty laid back"
good,I really enjoyed my job at caseys my boss shannon hall was amazing! I enjoyed my customers most of all! They helped me grow as a person an I got to get to know so many that became friends! I'd love to work for Casey's again!
good,I absolutely loved working for this company and I am hoping to maybe work there again at least part time.   The higher ups were so down to earth and personable and easy to work along side.
good,"Be ready to work. Fast paced, Los of hours, opportunity for advancement.  I enjoyed working at Carey's. I met some new friends and paid some bills. Had to move on."
good,A nice place to work. Shifts go by fast. Management is pretty good. There is plenty of room for advancement for those willing to work for it. Fair compensation.
good,"Casey's is a good place to work in my opinion.  There would often times be gossip floating around, but just keep your nose clear of it. There needs to be more emphasis on attendance."
good,"Making pizza was so fun, made days go by so fast. Being a cashier was fun because you got to meet and communicate with so many different types of people, and after a while of working there, people recognized you, it was real homey. the regulars were awesome."
good,"good place to work, good culture, good people management is good, communication is decemt, organized, able to flex your hours when you can, easy, not hard work."
good,"The staff was generally laid back, but we were always doing something. When we weren't swamped with orders we were preparing general display items, making sure all the prep work was done for incoming orders, or cleaning up our stations to keep the place sanitary. I'd often do a mixture of taking phone orders, making pizza or moving finished product, trying to balance the three. It was never too overwhelming and our management even helped out at times when we were overrun with orders. We all supported each other and were able to ask for help when we needed it. The worst it ever got was when our delivery woman's car flipped and we were all really worried most of the day, luckily she was fine and her car was fine so there weren't any lasting repercussions. I always enjoyed working here and always tried to get 1% better every day."
good,If there was a different manager I would be staying. Doesn't help with anything stays in office all day on phone and never has anything nice to say to anyone. No one from cooperate listens to their employees
good,A typical day at work was a pretty easy passed day making food. Wasn't to stressful but could be at times. Management was good. She was flexible with people with them wanting days off. She understands if you needed a day off every now and then.
good,good place to work just need to pay more.  the management was awesome but the GM was a decent guy..  Customers were actually very nice and they accommodated me and my service dog
good,"I loved Casey's. There were new people who came in every day. It was always busy, with something to always do. The staff was close and easy to get along with."
good,"I have worked here for over a year now, and they are very flexible with the hours scheduled. As I am in college I only work weekends when I go home. Overall this is a very positive experience."
good,"Made,baked, deep fat fried donuts, made and baked pizza, made warm sandwiches, sub sandwiches, salads, cleaned, prepared or set up for next day's business."
good,It was fun working at Casey's nice co workers clean store positive attitudes from customers and workers sometimes it could be rough with customers when they have events and stop in large groups.
good,Casey's is a fun and exciting place to work with good pay and benifts. It is a big and growing company that strives for good customer service. The food is good also
good,"Casey’s was an excellent place to work, it was fast paced, but simple. The managers were straightforward. My only issue, is the staff with minimal training, would treat me like I knew nothing, and they would always get in my way and take over for me when I was in the process of performing my job. Note, I’ve had weeks of training prior to their days of training."
good,Extremely enjoyable fast paced job dealing with  lots of people daily.  Teamwork is essential and each shift is required to do certain tasks.  Great place to work.  Salary increased on regular basis
good,I enjoyed this job because I am very social and I was able to see alot of new faces and learn how to greet people in a customer service manner. I also enjoyed working with the cash register and learning how to work with money.
good,"I enjoyed working here for Casey's, it was a fast paced working environment and we would get very busy at times. When beginning here at Casey's I believe that I was trained well for the position and the fast paced environment.  My manager here was very kind and helpful whenever I had any questions or concerns. It was a decent paying position for my area and not very far from my home for me to drive to work. The most enjoyable part to the job was working with my co-workers and serving the customers, as they were usually quite friendly and appreciative for the services received."
good,Everyone gets along great and is very team oriented. Management is helpful and its like a family i would recommend this job to anyone. The hours are flexible and paid vacation is a plus.
good,Casey's was fun job and i would love to mayb one day return. my days consisted of walking into my kitchen and going to look to see how much dough we had so i knew if i would have to make some when i came in or not. then i would get to work on taking phone call orders making pizzas and all other items. my most enjoyable part of my job was hearing a woman tell me she would look into the store before she came in to see if i was working and that would determine if she wanted to order pizza or not. she said i made the best pizza.
good,"I enjoyed working at Casey's.  I learned many of my work skills from this place of employment.  The other employees where fun to work with and played their role in the team. The managment was exceptional at most times.  I did have some issues with the managment towards the end but overall they are great, they just got flustered and took out their frustrations in a way I found unproffesional. At the store I worked at I loved everyone there including my manger and assistant managers. I would suggest this place for employment. Wages and benefits are more than fair and many opportunites are offered."
good,"This company is a great place. It's a one stop kinda place, they have pizza, subs, burgers, chicken tender and more. You can fill your gas tank and than fill your stomach."

good,I started this job while I was 17. Starting my senior year with only wanting to get a paycheck so I could use it for personal purchases. I grew to find out I loved my work and the people I saw everyday. I had taken pride in what I did and was excited for each day going into work. I feel like I can always find the positive side of things when working.
good,"a typical day at work was fun, as you had your favorite customers."
good,"on register you get to help customers get their product and then also talk with the regulars that sit at the tables to talk with one another. in the kitchen you clean, sanitize, and prepare food. its quick pace so you must be able to keep up"
good,"My coworkers and manager were very supportive and always willing to assist and help each other. Sometimes the job could be stressful, but with the team oriented mindset in that work place, it made even the worst experiences into better ones! They were a great bunch of ladies to work with and I wish I could have stayed longer."
good,Caseys is a great place to work. The pay could be better but not too bad for a gas station/pizza. I live in Argos so it makes it nice to be able to meet more of the people from here. I have fun every day i work.
good,I enjoyed my work experience and environment at Casey's! The fellow staff and management were all a great team of people. I would go back to this establishment if needed.
good,"Working at Casey's general store taught me a lot about customer service and money management."
good,Knowing your regular customers and saying hello to them every day was the best part about this job. Delivering pizza and cooking was also fun. This was a great job to have in a fun environment with a great team.
good,good part time high school job for anyone in need of some extra money coming in to their home. Not a place to spend more then 2 years here as the pay is low
good,I loved working at Casey's General store I had three friends who were also my managers they supported me my entire pregnancy with my first child and were more than willing to go above and beyond to help on bad days.
good,The managers were grea. Fast pace job always kept you busy. It was always clean and organized. Easy to move up if you did your job. Friendly employees.
good,I loved it. I would definately go back if I could.. I had great Co workers and an awesome manager. Everyone was easy to get along with. There was no drama.
good,"Well managed, but understaffed as any small town gas station. Would recommend this to a friend. It isn't a difficult job, just brace yourself for the rushes."
good,Everyone there was really nice. Great company to work for and wages were really great too.  Work with your schedule as well. All the employees get along
good,At Casey's i was mainly a pizza maker. I mostly worked in the kitchen but worked register every now and then. Everyone was friendly and i enjoyed working there.
good,"The kitchen work at times became tiresome, but the other employees were always willing to help.  I enjoyed the customers. The manager was also very helpful."
good,"i enjoyed woking for this company i advanced in only a few months, i had a family medical issue so i had to leave. i would still be with them if the position was still available"
good,Good company to work for overall. Would like to see benefits improve. Advancement seems to be based on who you know.  I enjoy what I do. Company is moving forward and growing at an impressive pace the hours for this from my job are good the work is rewarding I feel like I've accomplished something most every day
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my work at Casey's!  Our store was located in a small Kansas town, so we had a very familiar, and friendly, customer base.  Plus, most of my co-workers were from that same town, and knew their customers well.  Fortunately, that same small-town feel was extended to us who were from other nearby towns.  I still miss working there!"
good,"Casey's General Store is a great place to work! The work is not hard but time consuming at certain times, you don't have a lot of family time away from the store, the pay for employees isn't that great but as manager, the pay is great. I have learned so much as far as inventory, keeping all numbers correct, and ensuring all tickets and documents are put in the computer correctly. It is nice to have Supervisors that work with you as far as getting a set schedule for employees so they can still have family time as well. I thought of my employees as family members because we were all there together from set up of store, through all the training, and grand opening. If I had the opportunity to go back I would go back in a second!!!"
good,"Working at Casey's was my favorite job, the general manager is great, while I worked their my manager and assistant manager were amazing as well. They actually care about you and want to make the work environment better for you! The customers were all happy go lucky and loved to see you especially the regulars."
good,Casey's General Store is the one of the best places to work. I had so much fun there. You learn just about everything. The manager is great to talk to just about everything.
good,I enjoy working at Casey's.  It is a very relaxed company to work for.  I enjoy all of the employees that are working there as well.
good,"It was a great place to learn different things, the management was great and the other employees I worked with had great expectations. The hardest part of the job was getting up real early and dealing with certain customers that would come in and the most enjoyable part of the job was the regular customers that would come in and the other employees that worked there."
good,"wonderful experience in an upbeat energetic atmosphere .My job mainly included dividing the dining room in sections and assigning waiters and waitresses to their sections, creating the servers schedule and organizing daily pep talks and promotion reviews. co workers were great to work with, very diverse but all eager to work. hardest part of my job was maintain my composure as well as keeping servers clam yet efficient under extreme pressure when the restaurant is fully booked  ."
good,I got an amazing amount of hours to be a part time employee. However the people I worked with were very childish and it felt like a high school with the amount of employee gossip that floated through. I also didn't like that when my manager had corrections for us instead of having a meeting she would post rather RUDE notes for us to read.
good,"Overall Caseys is a great place to work,cleanliness and quality are held at a high standard even behind the scenes. The customers seem to be pleased for the most part. I learned to be a better people person there and how to stay organized among chaos.My district supervisor and manager were both good people to work for.I only ever had a problem with one co-worker,oherwise everyone got along pretty well.For me the hardest part  was getting everything out on time in the middle of a rush when there occasionally wasn't a float for the kitchen.The best part would've been both the social setting and when the customers would call in to give theyre compliments to the cook."
good,I loved this job except that everyone is hired in part time an I could not survive on that
good,being able to learn new things and cooking was fun to do. Making customers happy and satisfied with the orders. Keep customers coming back.
good,"if you are a good fast worker you will be bored to death, its a medium pace job with some big spirts once in a while."
good,"Go on the register and greet customers."
good,A typical day at work was always busy! The co-workers and the managers were always friendly and help out as much as they could!
good,its a good job hrs r good pay is not fair left cuz ppl that started after me made more than me
good,"cook, clean, cashier, It is a good place to work just have issues with the pay. i have a family to support and it is difficult to make that happen on what i bring hone"
good,"I enjoy my job at Casey's General Store. I learned people skills and how to deal with unhappy customers. The typical day consists of helping customers with transactions and general help. It also consists of stocking and cleaning. The best part of the job would be my co-workers. They make the job enjoyable even when it can be stressful. The hardest part is dealing with disgruntle customers, but this is part of any job. The management is very dependable and fair. I enjoy my job."
good,running a cash register meeting new customers and having experience with the food service with preparing their pizzas and subs. overall great place to work for if you are a student just out of school looking to get experience
good,I love working with all my co-workers and enjoy every day at the job
good,"I was the assistant manager, and then acting manager as they were looking to fill the position. I made friends with the regulars, and they came in just to see me sometimes. There was always something for me to do and stay busy and time seemed to fly while I was there. To me it wasn't as much work as a time to see the regulars and have friendly conversation. I did have a lot of responsibilitis, but I liked it."
good,"A Typical day was that every time i go in get all of the prep work done first before anything else. I get the dough machine ready when i need it, get the dough roller ready when i get a pizza order. I learned that everyone loves pizza on saturday and monday nights because people don't really like cooking on those days. The management was okay, the power that came with the job went to some peoples heads. My co-workers was okay, It all depended on who i was working with or what mood they were in that day. The hardest part of this job was when you get like 20 orders in row and trying to get them all out and ready to go when the customers show up to pick it up. The most enjoyable part of this job was that there was always someone in a good mood to make a bad turn in to a great day."
good,Great friendly atmosphere to work in and enjoy meeting new people
good,Most the people in the area are very kind and respectful and made my job ten times easier. Their pizzas are to die for and the kitchen does a good job with handling the orders as well.
good,"It's a good company. They could stand to raise the pay a little more. The hours are good, an you can talk to corporate about anything. Management is usually understanding when it comes to family emergencies and the work schedule is up for grabs."
good,"Customer service is a must so I spend  my time making customers my first priority. Over night cashier/stocking."
good,"I overall thought working at Casey's was great. the staff was diverse and the team overall communicated effectively most times. And besides that, I had friends within the staff I still have today!"
good,I loved working there.Would love to go back there to work. Amazing management and employee workers. Could see myself working there again with everyone.

good,"My job at Caseys is fun, friendly, fast paced, competitive, and fulfilling. I take pride in my work at caseys, and they provide incentives for great work."

good,Working at Casey's can be stressful but it's like a big family and we all work together to help one another. This place has a wide variety of. Benifits you can start to get them after 2 months of working with caseys.
good,"It's nice to meet new people through out the day. The food is good to eat. It's busy,  I love working in the kitchen area. I get along well with other."
good,Its a nice place just not to work most days just need more help and responsible people food is great just the environment and the attitudes of workers
good,"I just wish they offered more hours. The shifts are flexible, the people were great. But the rate of pay, hours per week vs bills and life, just didn't add up."
good,"I was able to come to work and have a clean section to work in, the management did have some problems but that was taken care of very quickly and the store manager was very hardworking."
good,"Speaking of the specific Casey's I worked at in Hermitage MO. My managers were and are understanding of complications that arise with their employees. They are patient and kind to new employees, and are always there to assist when a shift gets overwhelmed. Both the store manager and assistant store manager are generally cheerful people and lead the way for an overall happy work environment."
good,I enjoyed working at Casey's. I do wish they had more opportunities to advance and more full time positions. Great management people and easy to work for.
good,Great place to work! I enjoyed the hours I worked. We got discounts on food and beverages. I could have advanced in the job but decided to work at Stuteville.
good,you do a lot of cleaning. i learned how to work with others. the worse part was cleaning the bathrooms and they are not organized well its hard to find things also buffing at night is the worse during winter
good,"Typical work days are fast and fun."
good,It’s a fun place to work everyone there is really nice and easy to work with. I was super nervous to start there but everyone welcomed me in no problem.
good,They help you out if your struggling to fully understand everything they advance you to different parts of the store once you show you have the area that they originally put you on under control

good,I loved the customers an the duties i had to complete wasnt very hard.what made working at caseys in roseville difficult is the manager had a regular employee make all the decisions an thats why i took the job offer at marigold
good,It's fun but also serious when need be. Love the customers and the people who work there. Managers are awesome! Need some work on privacy but we had a meeting.
good,"Caseys was very fun to work at, but sometimes it got boring because my first couple days there no one really told me what to do. So I basically just stood around till I got off. I worked 8-4"

good,"I love working for Casey's for the proud, professional, positive, and polite atmosphere we work so hard to create.  Our company offers excellent training experiences for each person at every level within the company."
good,It was a store so every day was different.  It was always interesting to see what people would buy during a storm.  You had certain responsibilities.  You had to be on your feet all day. But if you are a people person it is the job for you.
good,"We are trained to always welcome the next person to walk through the door, taught to work efficiently and effectively. Always be polite, positive, professional and proud to be a member of the Casey’s team."
good,This job is really not bad if you enjoy working with the public. You see a lot of regulars and the work is the same each day so you build up a routine that teaches you multi-tasking and great organization skills.

good,I love working there but my store manager is horrible very rude and yells at us in front of customers she doesn’t know wat she is doing. Very inconsistant doesn’t care bout anything but her self she is rude to customers. She is very hard to work for. She’s a manipulater pathological liar and corporate won’t listen to anyone about how bad she is.
good,"At first the manager (who's in charge now) was understandable about my limits... but after a while she started to harp on me for not being able to move faster, despite keeping up with the demands."
good,"Good workplace just not so good  management, Managers in the food area would always call in and always ask for me to cover there shift. It got ridiculous "

good,The job is absolutely amazing. The customers are kind. The boss is understanding. They work with your schedule very well. I was sad to leave. The most difficult part of the job is keeping up during the lunch rush.

Instructions were clear and training was given when needed. I enjoyed working with my manager and other co-workers. The customers at the job made it quite enjoyable.

good,"A typical day of work at Casey's was not only productive, but it was also a fun place to work. The environment is clean, organized and ran very smooth. The management there treat their employees equal and with respect. There wasn't a problem if you wanted to work overtime and if you needed a certain day off, it wasn't a problem as long as there was enough time to find someone else to cover the shift. They offer benefits even to the part time employees which is extremely difficult to find. I would absolutely recommend Casey's to someone as an amazing working environment."
good,"I started the day by prepping the donuts to be baked, and put in the donut case. I learned how to make pizzas. The management was fantastic, I would work there again.

good,"If you like fast paced work, Casey's is a good place. It also gives you the opportunity to work up front with customers and that is the best part of the job."
good,My manager is great and he makes sure to work with us on when we can and cannot work. The hardest part of the job is making sure that customers are happy even when you cannot do what they want.
good,My boss and I got along very well. I just had to quit due to an ex boyfriend harassing me while I was at work. I'd definitely go back in a heart beat.
good,"We have a great family work enviroment at out particular store. We are a very great team and consider eachother family."

There were always little jobs that needed to be done on top of your daily routine. Overall, working there was learning experience."
good,"Working as a cashier, you meet a lot of the customers, interact with them, help them as needed.  Everybody was like a big family working in the building.  You got along with everyone, knew what everyone else was doing, helped one another and just kept up a great working relationship."
good,I love a fast paced workplace so this was the job for me. I liked always having something to do and always staying busy. Always makes for a fast day. The people are fun and easy to work with.
good,"I loved working at Casey's. The only reason I am not there any longer is relocation. My typical day at work would be bouncing back and forth between the register and the kitchen, and assisting the managers with any extra duties assigned. I loved working with customers and having responsibilities."
good,"i loved working here because i love working with diverse customer pool, loved the fast paced atmosphere. hardest part of the job is when customers only spoke spanish."
good,This was such a fun job. I would have stayed there but I moved out of state.
good,"Right when you walk in, you have to be ready and on your toes for your shift. Always having a smile on your face always helps with working with  the people. Fast count of your beginning till and then on to helping customers. Working at this covenant store you have multiple responsibilities and multiple areas of the store that you work in. Cash handling, outside customer care, stocking products, making sure the store is looking the best.

good,mainly did paperwork and ordered inventory. really enjoyed the people i worked with
good,"A typical day at my job was filled great challenges. I got the opportunity, not only lead a great group of people but was able to be a mentor to the folks that wanted to get promoted. I learned that most people will follow you if you are sincere about their future. Making sure we always had good people on the bench so to speak that were ready to take on a promotion. As far as upper management, I don't think I could have worked with a greater group of people. I really don't think any part of my job was hard. The most enjoyable part of my job was mentoring folks on my team."
good,"Clean, put orders in, make food, rotate products, solve complaints, counting deposits and drawers."
good,a typical day at work is dealing with customers and making there day easier and making them smile. I learned how things happen at gas stations and what other employees have to go through. management is ok but it needs some work. my co-workers need some improvement. the hardest part of the job is working a full 9 hour shift and not be able to sit down the whole time. the most enjoyable part is making sure everything is done before my shift is over.
good,In a typical day at work I am interacting with the public and taking care of customers.  Management is excellent.  I can't say enough about them.  My co-workers are fantastic and everyone works together as a team.  The hardest part of the job is handling difficult customers.

good,"Every aspect of Casey's was good for me but I was in a management position. For the work load the pay was sufficient in the years I worked for Jim Holland a franchise owner. "
good,I worked here part time to help with expenses. I enjoyed talking with all the people who came thru the store. I kept very busy and I enjoy staying busy. My co-workers were all very nice and I enjoyed working with them. I worked in the kitchen part at times making pizza and on the week-ends would go in and make the donuts. There was really nothing hard about the job. I enjoyed it as a part time position.
good,"Ran Register, assisted customers, counted money so that register balances correctly. Enjoyed everyone I worked with. En joyed assisting customer because of the small town we live in got to see people I had not seen in years Because everyone in town goes to Casey's."
good,You have to go above and beyond in this job - your customers are what drives you.  Management is top notch.  
good,the staff and manager are all helpful considerate and nice and they have decent training
good,I loved working for this company just had to many issues with the management. Management was lacking leadership and I was left having to do all of the store manager's responsibilities.
good,"A typical day at Casey's is a fast paced day; being a gas station/convenience store we had customers all day long with usually only an hour between rushes. In the kitchen I learned how to prepare subs and pizzas as well as other fast food items. Out in the store front I learned how to run an automated cash register, turn the gas pumps on and off, and count the money in the safe. Management was very friendly and easy to work with, my co-workers were fun and very helpful to explain something if I didn't understand. The hardest part of the job was counting the safe and closing the registers, the most enjoyable part of the job was working in the kitchen making pizzas."
good,"I loved working here,I did have good friends and a caring a manager who cared about her job and others as well. I would go back again knowing that the oppurtunity for a higher posisiton than I left being in would be available.."
good,"If you work hard,  you will be successful. This is not a job for someone who does not want to work hard. If your looking for  easy money, go somewhere else."

good,"I enjoyed working for Caseys both times that I worked for them. I learned lots of things in the kitchen, and I kept up with the pace of the assignment. I carried out complete inventory on my own for the kitchen orders. I loved the hours I was given and I never had to worry about if my schedule was changing or would conflict with other appointments I had previously scheduled."
good,"Casey's is a nice place to work.  Teamwork is a must and others help each other to keep the store clean and tasks complete.  Cutomer service is a priority with customers always come first, Kitchen staff follows all local health codes and are clean and efficent"
good,"Enjoy the work environment, the people that I work with, the customer interaction. Never a dull moment, and always something to do. Can be fast paced and excessively busy to a slow down to get caught up on stocking product/inventory and cleaning kitchen"
good,worked from 3 pm to 10 pm the management was easy to talk to if you had a question its a fast paced environment my co workers was very friendly and going.
good,Fast paced busy convenient store close to home. Make donuts and lunch prep for next days work. Take orders as well as keep warmers stocked and clean dishes and kitchen.
good,I learned to be fast and put others needs first . the hardest part of the job was making sure when you start a pump during rush to collect the cars information just in case they drove off.
good,Working for Casey's changed my life. I grew as the company grew. I loved being on a team as well as individual work flow. I love the people and the work ethic.
good,"I have the best management I’ve had out of a job so far and everyone I work with has great work ethic and are great to work around. "
good,The atmosphere of working there is pretty good. Some of the workers slack off/leave others to do their work sometimes. Manager is a very nice individual. I have some pretty good co-workers that I’ve become friends with. Overall a decent part time job.
good,Its a friendly place to work.  I came here last August and love it from day one. I worked on the sub side. They are pretty laid back on any problems life shall bring you. I would recommend it's a good starter job.
good,"I worked at 2 stores, the first one had an older manager that i didn't click with but that was okay with me because I was just there for a pay check. I met a lot of people by working here. Eventually I got tired of dealing with the games being played and transferred stores. The second store was great. I had a manager that worked the floor with us and hated being in the office, unlike the previous, and it made all of us feel more appreciated in that way. When working here it is all about the management because it can make or break the employment for a person"
good,"I started caseys in 2017 when i was 18, it was my first job. Being there almost 2 years i moved from part time-fulltime-kitchen manager- assistant manager. Very friendly place to work at."
good,It was usually a pretty laid back place to work. We would have our list of job duties that would need to get done and we would work on them throughout our shift. Most of the time it wasn't too hard to complete the job.
good,"Its a pretty busy store, but the people are friendly and things keep moving at a steady pace. I would definitely work there again under the right circumstances."
good,You receive raises yearly. If you have a problem you can discuss it with management and then they will deal with it. They have affordable health insurance. Any overtime you work it is paid to you and it is appreciated
good,Casey's treats their employees better than most gas station jobs. The pay is ok ($10.50/hour). Management at the store was very understanding and easy to get along with. You don't get very many hours per week.
good,"Was a good place to work. Every place has things they dont like, but, over all everyone got along and the majority did their fair share of work and would help each other out."
good,"I enjoyed so much working here, when I had the falling out with my coworker, personal issues, I quit because I didnt want to put extra  on my manager."
good,Its a great store but hard to advance career wise in there but need they to pay more because of all the duties they require you to do. Its a friendly enviroment and does have great packages as far ad insurance. I have worked there for 2 years and now making 9.75 hourly i think in my position it should be 10.00 or more.
good,"Casey's General Store in Abilene, KS is a very productive and fun workplace. I enjoyed working there and loved the people I worked with on a daily never a dull moment."
good,"fun faced paced kitchen crew, busy on fridays, and saturdays. Great pay. Great co workers & the customers are great also. Its a fun and easy going work place."
good,"Everyone is really friendly and is willing to help out with anything you need and answer any questions you got, i always love going to work cause i know ill have a great and successful day at work."
good,"Very good place to learn lots of things,great people,good place to have fun and meet lots of new people,team work is always the best for success and Casey's is the place for that"
good,I like working at Caseys. I enjoy the customers I enjoy my position a lot just not enough day hours and work almost every weekend a typical day is running the register stocking cleaning interacting with customers fast and courtesy pace what I have learned is listen to your customers the hardest part of my job is to see a customer unhappy I do whatever it takes to make them happy so they will continue to come back  the most enjoyable part of my job is to see people happy and smiling if you don't see that then they prolly wont come back and to offer any specials customers don't now the specials if you don't tell them for example 2 slices of pizza comes with a free 32 oz fountain soda most customers don't look at signs or if they are a regular customer and always get a specific item and you don't see it when they are at the counter offer it and chances are that's what they came for  I enjoy everything about my job!!!!
good,"I wait on customers, face the store, customer service."
good,I don’t mind the job better is always the way to go. The management is terrible though. People are selfish when making choices though. It’s not a career for me but it is a job till something comes along.
good,Everyone had a pretty positive attitude for the most part. Some days were a little more stressful if it was really busy. But as long as you kept working it wasn't too difficult to accomplish your tasks.
good,This was one of my favorite jobs working in a kitchen cooking pizzas and such. This was also my first experience in a kitchen other than my own at home.
good,"Depending on what shift you were on the day is different. Lunch shift is crazy during farming season and summer while kids are out of school. dinner shift is crazy on the weekends and Wednesday... no one wants to cook in the middle of the week it seems like. The only hard thing was keeping everything stocked for the next shift after having a crazy shift yourself. We all manage together even if we don't have the title. Our team was that, a team. We all helped one another if needed."
good,"Casey's was a great company to work for. With lots of benefits. Always room to advance and go farther with that as a career. Lots of challenges, but also lots of benefits."
good,I enjoyed working here. Fairly relaxed environment but very busy at times. Benefits were good and pay was fair. Hours varied but I enjoyed that. Prefer not doing the same thing all the time.
good,Good place to work. Plenty of opportunity for advancement in the company. Flexible hours and good management. Overall a good working atmosphere for all ages.
good,Loved working for this company.  The management and supervisors are great and really work with the employees.  Great opportunity to learn and develop new skills.  Great focus on customer service and training employees to provide a great customer experience.
good,"I loved working for Casey's, I had an amazing manager and co workers. My boss would work around anything we had going on so we could have a balance for work and personal."
good,I loved working here just couldn't take the mangers anymore and i told them about the employees stealing things and nothing was done. We had a lot of good/bad days.
good,"I love working for the company, the offer health benefits for the employee and their family's, Its a fast paste job, always keeping you on your toes. And always have a clean task to do to keep the company looking wonderful at all times for our customers."
good,"Many times when you work for a gas station it feels like your contently cleaning up after unsanitary people. With Casey's however, its clean neat and over all a clam and nice place to work."
good,A typical day at work would involve coming in and making sure that we would have everything we needed for the shift. Staling out any product if it needed to be. Making sure that when we closed that we prepped for the people who would come in in the morning. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people whom I worked with.
good,"A typical day at the particular Casey's that I work it is usually pretty easy going. My coworkers have excellent worth ethics, and we all work well together to get the job done, whatever it may be. From my 2+ years of working with this company, I have learned many things such as becoming more confident in myself, teamwork is key and to never be scared to ask questions! I started as a crew member and have worked my way up to the Food Service Leader position, and it has helped me build my confidence not only at my job, but outside as well. I have a great management team that is always willing to lend a helping hand and answer any questions I may have. I thoroughly enjoy my job with this company, so there really is no hard part to it. The most enjoyable parts of my job are definitely my coworkers and the loyal, friendly customers!"
good,I think caseys is great loves working with the managers they are very understanding n perfect place to settle in to if u want a life they are the best
good,"I absolutely loved working at Caseys and still till this day I will talk up working at Caseys! I loved it, loved the people, the work, the company, the pay everything was above par for me at that company!"
good,"Great job,  good company to work for.  On top of daily  routine,  great customer.  Was a good  company to make a career. Team players in daily routine."
good,"I work both breakfast and lunch rushes 4 days a week. My boss is amazing at working with needing time off and working around everyone's schedules. We operate cash registers, clean, stock, etc. I love working with the public and helping customers. I enjoy that I am in a small store where we have the same customers daily (usually). The downside for me is that there is nowhere to get off my feet other than outside. Since I have a hurt knee, this is bothersome for me. Truck day is the most fun for me because I enjoy seeing how much stuff we have sold since truck day the week before and the fresh, new items that we haven't had previously!"
good,"Great company as well as management. Multiple roles in company. Worked in kitchen as well as ran cash register. Friendly staff, excellent customer service. Enjoyed working in the kitchen preparing pizza's and other food. Making the donuts was one of my favorite jobs"
good,You get to know the regular customers very well and the routine of the work place is very easy to catch on to. I would have to say that the hardest part of the job would be 2nd shift at an overnight store trying to get all your ending shift duties done and getting swamped when you're by yourself!!
good,"at the time i worked there we only got minimum wage, since then it has increased. the manager was great to work under. if i could make more working there and have weekends off i would go back in a heartbeat."
good,I would honestly say that there isn't a bad thing about this job. If you needed help there was always someone there to help you. The people are nice and so are the customers.
good,Everyone was friendly and cooperative. Training was very good and was trained with respect. Loved being able to talk to people and help them. Enjoyed this job very much
good,"Loved working at Casey's General Store. Very Military appreciative. Hard work recognized. I worked in management for about 1 full year. The hardiest part was, at a 24 hour location, working as a manager, there is not a lot of free time with your family. Best part about working there was the customers. Small town pride and regular customers made my days there go by very pleasant."
good,This is a great place to work. Aery family friendly and very understanding when it comes to family emergencies. My dad went to the hospital after having a major heart attack and they let me go in the middle of a busy time with no questions asked other than when i got back they asked if he was ok.
good,There is always room to advance and if you want to they are happy to help. You can work many hours and even work at several stores if you would like. Management was understanding and seemed caring.
good,"able to maintain a good member of company with experience with money handling, greeting, house keeping on dailym orders that may be a time management "
good,excellent place for employment..can move up the ladder ..excellent benefits ..great chain of command ..fast passed..learning experience in many different fields..
good,"I had a great store manager, She helped me understand the job at a fast pace. The manager also went out of her way to give me Christmas present when she didn't have to I was low on cash so I had a gift to open Christmas day."
good,"depending on the day i either start by making the donuts and helping get the store open or i come in and make lunch or work the sub station and run the register. if it is a closing shift that i am working than i either close down the sub station or i close down the pizza are. I have learned a lot about food in this job, my co workers are great to work with and keep things interesting and my manager is great to work with as well as for.the hardest part of this job is Friday and Saturday keeping up with all the pizza orders and delivery orders. the most enjoyable part of this job is all the different people that i get to meet and really getting to know the regulars that come in."
good,I liked working here cause i had a great boss. she worked with my schedule no matter the situation. my coworkers were great to.
good,"liked working here, just needed to finish school. Management was great, got plenty of hours and fellow employees were good to work with."
good,"I get along with everyone I work with, including management.  I reset ovens from breakfast time/temps for lunch food.  I make sure food is available for customers. Pizza and sandwiches are made when ordered.  The kitchen is kept clean and stocked."
good,Prepare food as it was ordered. Loved the customers as well as co-workers. Friendly environment. Would get extremely busy but loved the fast paced worked. I learned a lot.
good,caseys was a good work place. the people where like a family.
good,Caseys is a very good place to work. The managers are great and they give you chance to move up and prove yourself.I have learned how with employee's better and customers.
good,I would come to work and count my safe and wait on customers all day. I learned how to make pizza and doughnuts and count cigarettes wax floors buff floors clean fuel pumps. While working for Caseys I worked with some of the best Coworkers I have ever worked for. The Hardest part of the job was cleaning out the grease trap. The best part of the Job was meeting all the different customers and learn what they get. To know the regulars when they walk threw the door.
good,"A good job and simple to do. Not a lasting career, though. Pay is low but benefits are awesome. Hardest part is dealing with customerss since we baby them if anything goes wrong. Aside from that I love it."
good,Pick orders to be filled for the stores. Good people to work with and the company treats you well.
good,The customers always find a way to brighten your day regardless of how good or bad of a day it is. The customers also realise that accidents and mess ups happen and they are very understanding
good,My job there has been amazing probably one of the best jobs ive ever had im gonna miss everyone when i move the work was very easy the pay wasnt bad i got plenty of hours the manager was always great to everyone the benefits are amazing!
good,"The hardest part of my job is feeling like I'm not good enough due to the manager always yelling st everyone and getting my hours cut. If I were to get a different job, it definitely would be somewhere with better pay and management"
good,It was the best I loved cooking and going between the cash register and the kitchen it was a fun experience and a great job experience and I would like to get a job there again
good,You can always work your way to management and it not take that long. They have excellent workers and flexible hours.  You get to work with the public.
good,"I love my job and most of my coworkers are wonderful.  If I had days I needed to have off for doctor appointments, and I let my manager know ahead of time, I had no issues getting that particular day off."
good,Casey's is a great company. They keep us up to date on stuff. There are all kinds of test to take to keep us up to date in the kitchen. It's also nice when the shift before u has things prepared for u.
good,Overall Casey's is a great company to work for. I started off as part-time in October 2018. Within two weeks I was full-time. And within three months I was assistant store manager. I'm currently still at Casey's and have the opportunity to become store manager within the next year. Room for advancement is plentiful in this company. They have great benefits and also have great programs in place to help  their employees.
good,Great place to work only thing I would change is the involvement with the HR process on handling problematic employees and HRs relationship with managers.
good,I really loved working there. It was a great job to work at. Easy work field and environment. Excellent coworkers. Overall great job opportunity. And good pay.
good,"There’s always an opportunity to learn more, and all you have to do to advance in the company is work hard and follow policy. Of course customer service and communication skills are a must, but overall if you just follow your job requirements it is an easy job and can be a lot of fun."
good,I am very pleased working for Casey's. It's a good company full of great people. I wouldn't trade my Casey's family for the world. They are awesome. The manager is cool as well.

good,I loved working at Casey's. I could have used more hours. I love the work environment. The manager i had was a previous manager of mine at Shoneys and she is fun and professional. She made my job experience at Casey's a learning experience.
good,"Casey's genuinely cares for their employees. They expect a lot from their employees and managers, but, they pay good too. There is a raise every year."
good,I worked for Casey's for approximately 6 years.  The environment there was very enticing.  I learned to deal with the public demands on a daily basis.
good,"I worked third shift and depending on what I scheduled for that night is what I would be doing. For the kitchen I would do the following:"
good,I loved working here! Everyone was always so friendly and willing to help. I learned a lot about customer service here. I also learned a lot about food service.
good,"When I first interviewed, I was offered an assistant management position.  I turned it down because I am the primary caregiver for my son and would not able to perform the duties necessary.  So I was given a part-time position in the kitchen which I greatly enjoyed.  It gave me great flexibility for my other jobs as well as being available to care for my son."
good,"I've been at Casey's for 2 years, I've enjoyed working here but I think it's time for me to move on. Overall this is a great temporary job, but it doesn't feel like a career."
good,"Everyday was different. I made great friends, & learned great things from Casey's. I learned how to work in hectic situations with the help of my co-workers."
good,Predictable days on average. Most times are slow enough to start cleaning around the shop. Working with a float that will help with the two person jobs and aid the other side of the shop when needed.
good,It was a good and fun work place started out at ten dollars an hour. Management were nice and easy to talk to. Free drinks and half off food was great! It was in a small town so you saw a lot of regular customers and friendly faces. Great store to work at!
good,"Night shift was mostly sliw paced. When it came to customers. The work required to do nightly cleaning and stocking was easy but kept me busy and made tge night seem to go by fast. I was able to keep a pisitive attitude through out my shift, which alliwed customers to return regularly. Management was very caring of my overall well being and all the empmoyess were easy to work with. I would highly recommend anyone seeking employment to give Casey's General Stores a try. I see Casey' s General Stores being a lasting company."
good,"It was a hard place to keep up. No help."
good,"A typical day begins with shifts exchanging job updates such as what is done and what will be needed done for your shift. Next prep-work and taking and filling customer sub or pizza orders over the counter; phone; Speed-Line computer or answering general questions. Next we make subs for end-caps and keep fresh slices of pizza must be kept in the warmer hourly for customer convenience. Wrapping cookies; boxing doughnuts; cleaning; paperwork is completed at the end of shifts."

Variety at it's best!"
good,I've been working with Casey's for little over three years and absolutely love my job. I'm a first assistant manager and love everything about it. I can't wait to get my own store.

The hardest part of the job was dealing with pizza orders at our busy time, but the customers are great and easy going."

I would help with truck when we had shippments in the store. I would but the treats away on the shelving. it was a very easy-going atmosphere which I absolutely hated leaving.
good,"I get to work i clock in wash my hands, make a list of prep work and things that need to be done. I first do my prep make sure i have enough under to make it through a rush and the day. I then make sure all the food in warmers are up to the hour and whatever is not i waste, remake, and take inventory of such. I make sure all the dishes are done and put away while maintaining an eye on counter and call in orders. I pre-make a couple of pizza just to make sure if i do get busy I can just throw them in the oven. I continue wit my list until finished or until I get busy. Before I leave at the end of my shift I make sure everything is up to the hour, clean and food is prepped for the next person. The hardest thing about my job is sometimes I would have to pick up the slack of a co worker while my sub and pizza line was piling up, or warmer food was expiring by the hour.The most enjoyable part about my job is our regular customers and getting to see the joy in their faces just because of the service, hospitality, and the food at my store."
good,"productive atmosphere, enjoy the co-workers and customers; can be very busy at times and sometimes very slow.  Management is congenial and works with my other part time job schedules."
good,Management was great to work with as they worked with my personal life. Was able to learn new items and procedures with different food items. Hardest part of job was lifting heavy items with no complaints from employees for asking help for assistance.

The things I have learned would be how to use pizza ovens, cash registers, unload semis and stock shelves The management was decent there were days but we all have bad days.  My co workers were mostly female and I was the only male so I was over worked sometimes but I love a good sweat.. I think the hardest part of the job was trying to close the kitchen and still getting orders. The most enjoyable part was being able to eat pizza all day...."
good,"Typical day consisted of checking out customers, maintaining a clean store, making sure items were stocked and organized, making pizzas and other food items per customer orders and for the warms and display. Iearned how to work at a fast pace during busy times, good communication and listening skills. Management was great. My boss was amazing. She was there for us and was understanding. My co workers were for the most part great people and fun to work with, except the occaisional no call no show. Hardest part was getting all side work done in a certain period of time especially on busy days. Most enjoyable part was the customers and regulars."
good,the people were nice and there was always work that had to be done which is ideal in my book. i loved staying busy until my shift was over. no matter what the time seemed to fly by
good,Never a boring day on the job. Being social and being productive went hand-in-hand and a coworker was always available if help was needed. Boss was very fair and gave opportunities for advancement fairly and in a timely manner. Every day was enjoyable and I thoroughly enjoyed my job and time spent at Casey's General Store. The hardest part of the job was generally when coworkers would call off and trying to get ahold of other coworkers to cover their shifts and the hectic days when truck would come bring in new supply weekly.
good,I enjoy working with the public and bringing my skills to the team here to help make it run smooth.  Has it challenges during peak times.
good,discounted food and good job while in college. you do not earn a whole lot of money but it is fun interacting with people.
good,"Pizza pro was a very ehusiastic business and provided needs to the Scott City people. We sometime delivered pizza in rain, and we never closed on time."
good,"I work as 2nd assistance manager. Helping others is a great part of my job. I work as a cashier, also in the kitchen making food. We stock shelves, fill and stock coolers, order supplies, unload truck, and provide overall customer service. Without our customers we would not be employed. My most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know my customers. I love my job but financially need something with better pay and healthcare benefits."
good,The company was professional and very up beat.  The job was fast paced but the employees would come together as a team to get through the night and make the next day easier for the nest.  My co-workers were very relaxed but hard working individuals.  the hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the customers.  The most enjoyable part was all of the customers.  Each person is different and has a different story to tell.
good,"Casey's was a great place to work, with wonderful managers, worked with my schedule and helped me as much as they could hours wise. I would definately work here again."

good,Casey's by far has been one of the best places I ever worked. I showed up every day and was left to continue what I was doing and not micromanaged at all. The people there are a good group of guys and as long as you are productive and do your job you have the privilege of taking a small break or getting coffee. Management is down to Earth and are so friendly and family orinted. People remember your name and you're not treated as just a number.

good,Good place to work. The staff is friendly and flexible. Everyone works together as a team. There's no greater feeling than serving the community. The only thing that didn't work out for me was the hours of the overnight shift.
good,Loved this company the only reason i left is because i moved out of range from my location and was unable to travel that far to get back and forth from work
good,"Casey's taught me new skills that will be beneficial to have as I move forward into different jobs. I was always excited to go to work, management was great."
good,"I really enjoyed working Here. I met a lot of cool new people and learned a lot about the industry. It was fulfilling work, hectic at times, but overall, I enjoyed it."
good,"Casey is the job you want to get up and go to, for it to be a convenient store!. Dealing with people can be pretty hard if your not a sociable person."
good,Trying to keep up with orders especially when there is event's going on in town and making sure they are done on time when the customers request. Sometimes there are orders that overlap orders.
good,I like working for Casey’s they pay fair competitive wages. Care for their customers and employees. They are building new store all the time. They are community oriented

good,The boss is understanding and the place is clean the workers are friendly and we provide good customer service I just believe we need less breaks and more collaboration.
good,"I always felt at home while walking into the store. I learned many things of how to clean, how to cook their food, how to manage the registers and even how to stock. Workplace culture was relaxing at times, but there were times where it became stressful but satisfying in the end. People got along and heavily based themselves on teamwork. There were really no hard parts of the job besides dealing with rush hour, but I enjoyed going there to work and know I had people to back me up. I enjoyed walking in and knowing they were waiting for me and are always happy to see me."
good,"I was a kitchen worker/cashier for Casey's general store. I would cool,clean,prep items that needed to be prepped,stock freight and unload trucks. I loved it!"

good,"I started as a shift member And quickly advanced to assistant manager position, better pay, the boss is very good to all of us and offers alot of hrs and advancments .they offer college courses and more. Good pay and pay raises often."
good,Great place to work. Couldnt work the over nights because of my family. But chances to move up in the company and very competitive wages and chances to get overtime
good,"Fun, fast paced, great customers, good for someone wanting to cook or run a cash register and is okay with cleaning. I worked here for 2 years and I only left because I was moving."
good,"I loved working at Casey's. However it was at times stressful. My coworkers would not always do as they were suppose to, so I picked up the slack. Which I did tell my manager about and we then had a meeting"
good,Beat place ever worked for wish I could go back and be a manager but lost my licenses and can't be a manager with no licenses they work with you for a flexiable schedule
good,I was sad to leave Casey's. They were very good at explaining company policy and company procedures. They were good about listening if you needed a certaiin day off. It broke my heart to leave this company.
good,Great place to work and great place to advance in. A typical work day at Casey's is fun yet productive. Management is amazing there. The hardest part of he job was changing pops for the fountain.
good,"The pay is pretty good for working at a convenience store/service station. The work is not hard at all. Many benefits are offered to both full time and part time employees, paid for out of pocket (better than nothing if you need them). The mood of the shift pretty much depends on the co-workers surrounding you."
good,I ran a cash register. between customers I cleaned the drink area or dust mopped the floor. I tried to stay busy even when their was a slow time between customers
good,It was an experience that I had never had got to meet aloud n different  people n the co'worket  was excellent  n friendly  n learn alot dealing with trucks credit card

good,"You don't realize all that goes into a job of working at a gas station. It is hard work to work there. However, the co-workers are amazing, reliable and easy to talk to."
good,I loved working for Casey's. The environment is great. The hours are wonderful! Corporate is really what makes the job stressful and makes people want to quit.
good,"I worked there for about 3 years.  I totally enjoyed the job.  Our manager was excellent at her job.  They had great insurance benefits, vacation days.  Advancements to move up are there for the workers."
good,Casey's was the best job I ever had. Loved the work and the coworkers. Casey's cares about their employees. Would love to work their again. I started as subcook and went to kitchen manager than to asst. Manager. I'd still be there but I moved for personal reasons. If Casey's ever comes to Wyoming I'll be working there again.
good,"This position has you constantly doing something, you are working every moment you are there. Very family-like atmosphere among coworkers, making it one of the best food industry positions I have ever held. Casey's is by far one of the best convenience store/kitchenette businesses to ever work for."
good,"It's a great place for your first job. They let you have free soda the whole time you are working. 50% off all warm food while your working. Its easy work as long as you can work with money, and you have to have great costumer service."
good,Great place to work. Enjoyed my customers. Work was easy. The only thing I didnt like was the racism. Fast pace job. Interview was fast and over in no time. Hired me and I started working the next day.

good,"Great place to work always two people on shift. Good benefits, good training program for management, this company gives back to the community. Great place to work. I would highly recommend this job to anyone looking for a new occupation."
good,I do as much as I can as fast as I can the best that I can. I go above and beyond with any and every job. I make sure all my general dutys are done sometimes help others with theirs and try to be as helpful as possible. I start off coming inn getting clean water for when we wipe things down. I then stock the beer cave an cooler. Then I try to sweep and mop then follow that up with cleaning the bathrooms and taking out trash. We always have a lot of customers so it is a challenge because we get so busy. The hardest part is because I'm always moving and rushing to get things done I often am faced with nothing else to do. Then I decide to do a little extra. Whatever I can really. I end my busy day off with the dumping and cleaning the coffee and tea pots and then I sweep and mop the store and wait for my replacement to get here. I know it doesn't sound like much but there is a lot of running and rushing around. My job is easy. I love it. My co workers are even better.
good,It's a good Co.pany that promotes from within rather than brining in someone you would have to train. You can move up fast as the turnover there is huge.
good,I enjoyed working there and miss it very much so sad I had to move to another state. I enjoyed the other employees were awesome working with as well as the customers. The management was amazing !!! It's not easy finding a good job with great management.
good,Love the store would recommend working here . They are a fast an friendly place to work for. They are flexible for family's an it's more of a family than a work place
good,"fast paced, friendly enviroment to work in, availability to move up, good customer relationships building, hardest part of the job for me would have been the hours i was working with a family"
good,I’ve learned to overcome my shyness from when I was in school and also learned to speak up and not be soft spoken. The management team was pretty easy going and always tried to work around people’s other schedule if they had another job. The most enjoyable I would have to say is visiting with the customers and meeting new people that I worked with and the job wasn’t even really that hard of work.
good,"I loved working here. Each store is a little different because they are individually managed. The work is not that hard, just have to stay busy.  Fine soemthing to do when there is down tine."
good,The mangers were amazing. The other staff was very easy going to easy to worl with. My boss was very hands on eith my training  and made sure i understood everything before he threw me into it on my own.
good,I loved everything about working at Caseys. The staff and customers were so diverse and it made everything so much more interesting. I never figured I would love a job at a gas station as much as I loved this one!
good,"Love my boss,  great schedule, great products, tons of training, willingness to help each other,  paid holidays and vacation and sick hours, support my organization"
good,Loved working here would definitely go back if it wasnt for the fact that i relocated and had to quit my job. I would most definitely recommend anyone that would like to work at a caseys store.
good,Casey's was fun. My coworkers and I got along great. I liked all the regular customers. Casey's was a great place to work. My favorite place I have worked at so far.
good,great place to work as long as your not lazy work hard and stay busy and its not a bad place. Great team effort and relability is a must. Customers can be onery but nothing to bad.
good,It was a very decent place to work just left to go to a restaurant job because they had offered me a day shift. I had been stuck on nights for so long it seemed like a good idea
good,"I learned a lot in the role of being a cashier for Casey’s general store, I learned how to be a role model and help one another out with a task , load"
good,And you're not I absolutely love my job at Casey's General Stores I am still currently employed with Casey's with much room for training and advancement I look forward to moving up within the company.
good,"I really enjoy working for Casey's I have met a lot of people! I try to make it a fun environment as well as taking your job seriously. I feel if you treat your employee's with respect they work harder and care more for the company. Each employee I hire I train them to be leaders and let them know they are more than a cashier or cook, The hardest part for me is the firing of an employee because I feel I failed them as a leader but I have come to understand that it was not my choices that caused their termination. I genuinely care for my employee's as well as my customers."
good,Love the manager and the coworkers. Very clean and not very busy. Enjoyed the donuts and food. My son loves the pizza a lot. My baby loves slushies and soda.
good,"They are very friendly and hard working. What more could u ask for. Our store is very clean and our boss is reliable, hard-working and always make sure everybody has their job done."
good,"Obeying the requirements of the job based on state tobacco policy, and food health service regulations.  I love the place it a job always makes me feel like I am needed."
good,This is the job for you if you like to be relaxed and just chill you work by yourself and with one other person. making pizzas was easy it sometimes gave you a go but that made it exciting.
good,I loved the staff and the management I worked with. I would recommend it! If you love working with really nice people as well as being able to be greeted by nice customers this is the place for you!
good,"The best job, the best company, the best people and the best opportunity to move up. If you work hard they will notice! They believe in you! I'm grateful for having the opportunity. I hope to have it again in the future if they can make their way to the west coast."
good,I worked for Casey's for almost 10 years. My boss was amazing and made sure I got the time off I needed. It was very stressful  place to work. Dealing with the truck drivers and upset customers but I dealt with it and I enjoyed working there even though it was strressful
good,"I like working  at Casey's,  customers are always friendly,  makes the time go by quick, food is delicious. And inexpensive. No breaks, due to being constantly busy."
good,Management was good at what they did and made the work environment fun yet holds each employee accountable for their own actions. Not a bad work experience and enjoyed coming to work.
good,The Princeton KY location is a great place to work!! Management is great. They will work with you on what hours you can work. Great atmosphere. Coworkers are great.
good,It was great had great managers always had work wish I could have stayed I recommend them for anyone trying to work and willing to pull their hours and weight
good,"I would still be working there had I been doing the job I was hired for.  Great people, great benefits, easy people to learn from. I would go back if I could."
good,loved the employees loved my job. Loved the people that came in I had regulars I loved baking the pizza I loved frying the food doing the dishes.  Taking orders when it got backed up it got exciting.
good,There was nothing that I didn't like about this job. The other employees that work there are all easy to get along with. Very organized and clean workplace.
good,"they take good care of their employees. they give you a discount, plenty of opportunities to move up within the company, and lots of benefits for both full and part time employees/"
good,"I worked for Caseys General Store for years, I love all the jobs I did and the thing you learn. I enjoyed meeting people who traveled, and would stop for coffee, or a donut, The pizza is the best!"
good,They always made sure you were liking your boys at the store and if something was like ripped or anything they would take care of it they always had a smile on there face and there managerment was the best
good,Prepped salad bar items served drinks cleaned booths waited onguests.  Closed and opened. Ran the register etc.   New. Owners now not real friendly. Guests were great came in as regulars
good,"I got a lot done while working at Casey, it was easy to get it down. I would say Caseys was a very great store and I would definitely recommend someone else to work there for sure."
good,Employees and managers are great. They help you with everything if you need it. Training is very great hours are great pay is decent. Fast paced work.
good,"Meet and greet customers politely"
good,Extremely nice place to you get treated like your welcome there good food nice managers work with hours as being a mother.easy to catch on to no hard work stress free.
good,"I worked here in high school and it was the best job ever. I loved working at Casey's. My bosses were always nice, my co workers were always nice and helpful!"
good,I love working here the people are way make it awesome. Muy manager is caring and supportive. The only change I would mention not really a change more of an addition that could be made to increase employee performance and attitude would be installing speakers and a radio to play through the day rather than working In total silence giving the feeling of the shift dragging on.
good,"Counting money for deposit making sure all shift counts match balance out the day before opening , making sure store is cleaned and stocked , coffee and donuts are ready before store opens . Learned how to set and reset planograms , do ordering for store , day to day operations of the store. Management was super great like a family oriented environment .  Hardest part of the job keeping the cooler stocked and organized. was the customers you got to know and see every day ."
good,My co-workers and management are family to me. Almost everyone got along extremely well. Only quit because new district manager and corporate involvement. Everyone's hours have been cut so full time isn't more than 35hrs/week. I also needed a raise to pay a new bill I have and the size of the raise i needed was too big for corporate to accept for the management position I was trying for.
good,had a great experience working for Casey's just messed up a little bit on some paperwork and stuff but overall it was a great company to work for. And I love the employees
good,"The workplace was enjoyable and the coworkers made it worth your while. It could be competitive at times, but nothing that was unmanageable. I would recommend this job to anybody."
good,I love the way u interfaith people and meet there needs. Got good workers and hours do a lot of different things. Keep clean store and stocked for the next day
good,I would work at another Casey's if I could. It was a great environment and the staff was amazing. I loved the people I worked with no matter the shift I had. I always volunteered to pick up extra shifts because I loved it so much.
good,I enjoyed working at Casey's being assistant manager had to pull a lot of the stuff that the manager did not want to do Ram cashier donut shop ordered unloaded did a lot of the stuff I enjoyed working with people I enjoy working and talking to people
good,Caseys was a great place to work.  The downfall was when the kitchen help did not show up and I had to fill in for them plus watch the customers coming in and out.
good,Good job good place too be .. job brings a lot and friendly people I would recommend this job to anyone who wants to start off right and get a nice decent job
good,Everyone is friendly and they joke around. We all help each other out. It is a good place to meet new people. It is hard to keep the pizza warm full because people keep coming in.
good,great company to work for. they care about the employees and make sure that they have a friendly and safe enviroment to work in. customer service is the main priority

good,"Casey’s was a very great job , loved working with the customers and also the other employees. It was a very great experience. You meet new people and do new things for the first time."
good,The people there are always on task and never had any issues with anyone or anything. Just a relaxing place to work overall with no distractions or anyone being rude or uptight.
good,Love being able to converse with customers. Managers are fair but stern. Willing to listen if you have at home problems and help out when they can. They get it. Life happens. Very good training. I have had other jobs that you are just thrown into and just have to wing it. Not at caseys. She allowed a good amount of days with a trainer.
good,There was no problem. The work  was easy and the workers was nice and friendly. If I choice I would go back to work there. The customers are nice and easy to help.

good,I think it can be a great working place because i enjoyed the different positions i had to work. I loved being around customers and having regular people.
good,i worked here multiple times between jobs and was welcomed back everytime with open arms and help from peers. everyone is like a family here to help those in need
good,"Loved working at Casey's. Advanced quickly and learned to manage a team here. The management was always great and I enjoyed my customers everyday. Offers vacation time, insurance, and good raises!"
good,"Each store is ran by a manager, unfortunately they don't get all the reins they need to run the store because of the district manager. If you have a district manager who wants to put added stress on management, it can cause serious problems that leaks down to employees. I wish they would adopt a paperless system. It is very repetitive to audit daily and print off papers no one uses. They introduced ADP and should really take full advantage of it to update employees on specials and new rules. Give your kitchen help, more help."
good,Loved working there they work with ur hours that U can work u get the days off u request off overall great company to work for pay was great so is the mangment
good,I worked there and really enjoyed everyone i worked with and enjoyed being there. my boss was really cool too. I had fun with customers they was nice too.
good,"Productive Fun Place to work, you can  work as many hours as u want they r very flexible with scheduling or setting a set schedule was always busy during my entire shift"
good,Casey's General store is the best place to work. They provide quality customer service and the best product. Advancement opportunity if desired. Fair management and flexible schedules are a plus at Casey's.
good,The people I worked with were very good people. I loved this job because I had the opportunity to meet new people everyday and learn new things and there was room for growth with company.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is right before I got off work I got to watch the sun rise from the window every morning. It was one of the most beautiful things ever.
good,I enjoyed coworkers and management they were great to work with they took the time to train gave me experience  and knowledge of register  I learned how to make pizzas and subs also learned unloading truck and where to put items on shelves.
good,"I loved working here. The location allowed for a fast-paced environment and my coworkers were amazing. I was rarely stressed from work but came home tired from a hard days work. My three managers were absolutely amazing. Just do your job and they won't have any issues. The regular customers and co-workers were what made work enjoyable. There were days where I looked forward to coming to work, and that was almost every day. The hardest part of the job, there was not anything too terribly difficult. AMAZING PLACE TO WORK!!!!! Review: 10/10"
good,"Great place to work, plus great people. Loving employee helpful in every way possible. Work experience there was great and I would work there again easy"

good,"I checked out customers and made sure they had everything they needed, i cleaned the store, i organized the store, i stocked the store and i took out the trashes. I learned proper people skills and how to deal with certain situations, i learned how to properly stock and organize things and i learned how to properly handle money."
good,"A typical day at work depended on the season. It was a lot busier durng the summer due to being closer to the lake. My positions switched depending on what I was scheduled for that day. I learned a lot from this place. A lot of it was because my manager at the time was more than willing to teach me. I learned audits, bookkeeping, inventory order/count/and stocking. I learned how to run a cash register and log information into the computer. The hardest part of the job was when the district manager was coming. This is because she did not get a long with most of us and had a snobby attitude. The most enjoyable part was working with everyone and being able to learn as much as I wanted to. It was a great first job for me and it set me up for some of my future jobs."
good,"Stand by their employees, with career advancements that out perform other companies. I had the oppertunity to hire and train my own team of twenty, with three managers underneath me. Successfully felt that the company was there full force in any asoect their employees needed."
good,"Friendly staff, and known for their amazing pizza.  They offer everything you could need with a quick stop in a convenient stopping area.  Clean and large selection of products."
good,Great please to work. Management and team members are easy to get along with and are very understanding. Loved working here and would go back anytime.
good,I would go back to Casey's in my hometown but they are only hiring for Friday & Saturday delivery drivers. I don't want to put the wear & tear on my own vehicle.
good,"When I worked at Casey's, I learned that it was a great place to work. From the Pay to the Benefits and to the People you worked with, there was always a reason to keep coming back to work everyday"

good,I have worked for Casey's twice now. They really work to give you the hours you want and have great benefits It is not a stressful or overwhelming. It will always be my go back to.
good,"depending on what area you are hired for you can either have a relaxed boring shift or a fast paced, always moving shift. Most of the people working at caseys has a great, fun, outgoing personalities. Others are kinda stick in the muds. Managers are fun to be around and are pretty easy going as long as things are getting done and the store has a clean appearance and the customers are being taken care of first."
good,"i had an awesome time working here the manager was an awesome person to work for, the employees were good people all around i had an amazing experience"
good,Casey’s was a wonderful job but I had a baby and stuff came up and I just couldn’t go back I am still very close to everyone I worked with because everyone will treat you like family!!
good,caseys is a good company to work for. I got all my stuff done and got out of there on time. I usually worked 3-11:30 and nothing over that. My boss was really understanding.
good,this was my best job ever. i enjoyed every second. my regulars and i became very close and very good friends. the vendors were super nice too and i miss everyone who i worked with
good,"Working at Casey's helped me have excellent customer service skills,  There are many chances to grow at caseys to become upper managment or even area mangment."
good,"I work the donut shift (3:30-9 or 10) I love the work itself, but the hours are brutal on a relationship or family life. The job itself is a fun thing, though."
good,casey's wasn't bad at all but it wasn't a permanent place either like McDonalds or something else it was just a regular regular job that one like myself did when i was 18 years old
good,In a days work you will serve and assist customers Depending on what area you work in. In the kitchen you will help them by making their food or helping them pick out which food they would like. Up Front You will help them with their gas and other non food related needs. Its a nice and calm environment that anyone with common sense can work in. There is also tons of room to grow and advance up the corporate chain.

good,"Management is great, they teach you everything you need to know, heavy lifting is sometimes required, as long as you do your job its a excellent place to work."
good,Very flexible with your schedule. It is a fun place to work and you will get a lot of face to face interactions with all of the customers. You will most likey gain some lie long friends out of your co-workers.
good,"I would still be working at Casey's today if personal matters didn't come up at home. "
good,"A VERY multi-tasking job.And a job that your pace has to continuously be fast at.There is no time between task to lean,talk to others etc.You always have to be working in order to make sure everything is done properly and that your task are completed by the time your shift ends,because you are only allowed 5 minutes after your scheduled shift ends to stay and work over.But I love the doing 3-4 different task at a time and keeping busy during a work day.Because I can't stand boredom if something is completed and there is no task afterwards."
good,"A growing business which includes opportunity for advancements with friendly guidance from staff along the way. Hands on training that helps a lot when working situations become a little more dynamic. The pay is fair. If I had any advice I'd provide for new employees it would be that good customer service is definitely key, as well as teamwork, and good time management skills, or skills with a register."
good,"I make pizza's  and help stock when needed and clean. i learned how to make pizza's and how to make dough. the store manager i great  she answers all the question i have when i have them. workplace culture is relaxed when it needs to be and serious when it needs to be. I say the hardest part of my job is making the pizza's it doesn't sound hard but on night like Fridays and Saturdays it rough, due to orders just coming in all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, friendly and kinda they are always."
good,"awesome manager"
good,Well this is a fairly good place for some one that is still in school that is looking for a part time job . Learn a lot of skills on how to greet people when entering

good,"Everyone was very friendly, co workers were awesome. Great place to work. This would make a good part time job for a student or adult looking to make extra money"
good,"I loved this job, they were flexible with my hours and understanding when I needed time off or things suddenly coming up. Even when the weather was less than ideal and I couldn't make the 20min drive they were sweet and understanding."
good,love it wouldn't have left if I didn't want to he stay at home mother friendly  Co workers easy work  regular customers friendly I would recommend working for Casey's general store
good,Typically every time I would come to work I'd always be greeted by my coworkers. It was almost a necessity to greet everyone that entered the store because we always want someone to feel good entering the establishment. The workplace was always clean for each  upcoming shift as it's common courtesy to clean up after yourself but I digress. The hardest parts of the job are keeping up with demand if you're the only one able to work at the moment. Though the more enjoyable parts are when you rarely have time to stop because you're too focused on doing what you get paid to do.
good,I love my cashier job when I worked at Casey's General Store I was also cross-trained in the kitchen so also made a piece of salads hot wings breadsticks sub sandwiches are there multiple things working at a convenience store and it always kept me busy one of the things that I love the most I love to keep busy I believe I have real good customer service when it comes to speaking with people in control myself in a professional manner at all times
good,Outstanding company too work for. Co-workers were easy too get along with and they were always very helpful in assisting in the job requirements at hand.
good,The customers and co-workers are great. I learned a lot about how to handle situations calmly and respectfully. The hardest part about the job was to keep up with stocking because you had to watch the front register at the same time.

good,its a great place with great people. I coud not have had work at a better place because working at caseys you are able to move up if the bosses saw improvement.

good,My manager was awesome! we had a great time at the store when we did go to work. It didn't even feel like work when you went in for your position. I would work there in a heart beat.

good,It was a very easy day most days except for when the summer time hit. Everyday was usually the same routine wise except for the calls that came in through out the day that were different orders.
good,This is a great place to work.  The management team was promoted from with in so the management team is just as willing to work aside the emmployees and the need arises.
good,Caseys was fun and interesting place to work. It exposed me to a lot of different customer types and allowed me to meet a lot of the population of milford
good,The manager at Casey's didn't expect you to do anything that she wouldn't do she worked right along beside you on a daily basis she didn't treat employees different because they were different she treated the same she didn't hire you because you were different she hired you because she thought you could do the job she understood problems even though she was young she was relaxed kind and very energetic she kept a clean store she wasn't doing it herself she was having others do it she knew how to be a manager she knew how to treat people equally she knew if she wanted respect she had to give it where most people are bosses think that since their boss they should get it no matter what

good,Great store manager but lacked help in store. The assistant managers refused to work and so did hourly employees. Get burned out quickly. Constantly called in on days off to work. Employees would pull no call no shows and still have jobs. The staff worked when they wanted and not when scheduled.
good,"easy laid back job, training for the first three or so months then you go to your shift and train another month until you are on your own and then you can ask questions when you need to."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day would be through the whole day. Because you get to interact with so many different people and see how their day is going.

good,It was A Nice Place to work Just called the Manager to see if they were Hiring she said that she just hired someone so she told me to stay intouch with her
good,"esponsible for cashiering, collecting cash payments from customers and making change, or charging purchases to customers' credit cards and providing customers with receipts. They clean, collect, and dispose outside trash."
good,"Supervisor was great, worked with you if you didn't know how to do something or if you needed help better understanding what your job and all your responsibilities. The training was up to par and everyone was friendly. Clean areas, friendly service, and great work place all around."
good,I worked only part time because it was close to where I lived. I had children in school so it worked out greatly for a part time position. I got to meet a lot of different types of people. It was truly a wonderful job and I actually loved the entire aspect of the company and my duties.
good,Its a pretty good place to work as long as you can deal with the drama that goes on. The store manager is good at her job with the office work but not good with conflict so it creates at lot of drama and nothing ever gets done about it. But the assistant managers are amazing at their job and taking care of their employees
good,A great place to work. I also work with great people. The bosses are very flexible and try and help you in any way that they can. If you are looking to advance in a company this is the place to do so.
good,"Duties while employed with Caseys included buffing and waxing floors, sanitizing work area, inspecting food storage units for health hazards, customer service, and cash handling."
good,I love how this work plaace takes you in and makes you a top priority while training explaining and maintaining your skills and the opportunities that caseys can provide for you.

good,I loved working here. It was a good environment and they were good people. They worked well with my other jobs and I would more than recommend this to anyone looking for a good job with great benefits. They also work well with people with children.
good,I enjoyed my work at Casey's. I was a Second Assistant Manager while I worked there. I learned quite a bit on how to build a relationship with not only our customers but our vendors. The Management was great I learned many valuable tips from both the Manager and Assistant Manager. When I left that job I came away with a better understanding that the Customers are key to our success as a customer relation business. There was no hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was dealing with the customers and seeing their smiling faces on a daily basis.
good,Great people to work with and customers to serve. Very friendly and productive environment. Many opportunities to advance and impress employers and customers.
good,Casey's is a fun to place to be for customers and employees. It is a company that cares about the lives and well being of both employees and customers and continues to show that through the products and activities they take part in.
good,"Good place to work, flexible schedule. The company does a good job at training personel. My only complaint would be that the 'seasoned' workers seem to have thier own little cliques and don't care so much for new workers"
good,"A typical day at work is walking into the smell of fresh pizza, coffee and donuts. Labor is not intense, cashiering is actaully a laid back position. Working in the kitchen is productive."
good,"It is a very fast paced job, however its quick to get the hang of. I enjoy meeting new people, so i liked that it was busy and i got to meet new people every day. The casey's store is very fair people and seem to always hire very kind workers."
good,"I would open the  store, count money and put it in the proper place. I would check the product and write down what is needed and put things in the proper place, stock shelves, make sure store is clean.I would help customers with whatever is needed. I would make sure that the grounds outside the building were clean and that the area near the gas pumps had enough washer fluid and paper towels. I would make sure that I and my employees paid attention to the pumps to limit gas drive offs because at that time there were no cameras."
good,"Cashier"
good,"Casey, Mt. Pleasant Iowa has an awesome group of employee that all work to make the work environment a fun place. "
good,"Great place to work . People are friendly, wages are fairly descent. Friendly staff and excellent food, pizza is swell. Gas is a good time to time. I k b ff"
good,I enjoy the atmosphere at Caseys. Customers and staff are wonderful. They work with your scheduling so it works for you. They are team oriented and work as a team.
good,Needs more people to run managing skills . Theres a lot drama that doesn't need to be done. But another wise its a good work environment and great benefits and extra. A lot of different work time schedual like you can work from the morning or night or over night and sometime you don't get what you want.
good,"Great customer service "
good,Its an alright job but not my thing. I was a cashier. I cleaned the store. Bathrooms. Outside trash. I also took people money when they bought something. I also answered the outside pump. So when before they pump the gas I have to click in to let them to know to pay inside. I also made sure the shelves was stocked!
good,people were fun to work with everyone worked as a team made some life long friends working here. benefits are great not an actual breaks but still a great place to work
good,Fun and safe. always feel welcome. get to meet new people. Cleaning task are easy and productive. Clean store. Managers are respectful. Team effort all around.
good,The usual  kitchen staff day is you make all the pizzas and menu items while someone else will get the sandwiches made. On other days you might run a cash register. Management was fun and friendly and also made sure we were on task. The hardest part of the job was probably cleaning the ice cooler out. The best part of the job is 30% off all food.
good,"Working at Casey's General Store you are faced with many challenges everyday. If a machine broke down or was not functioning properly, you were required to remember your training. This meant taking apart the machine to clean it or if nothing else worked you notified your manger so they could call a repair man.

good,"I've worked at two different Casey's general stores and they both operated very differently. The one in Silver Lake operates almost at what I think should be considered prime operations, but the one I worked for off California in Topeka made me feel very nervous especially considering everything I'd been going through at the time. Having lost my place to live, and having to skate everywhere. It wasn't the type of work environment I've been used to. Though for the most part, and after moving back to Silver lake I realized some people just kind of freak me out and make me realize things about them that I almost feel like I never should have. Though overall I believe Casey's to be a very good company with great benefits that made me feel very comfortable while I worked there, but the people that I was working with did make me feel very uncomfortable. At least the ones in Topeka."

good,Well i'm excited to learn new things and im very fast at catching on to the jobs I am learning and im a very hard worker. My boss was very professional the work environment was not the greatest. The hardest part of the job is when an employee didn't do his or her job and I had to clean up after them and do what they did not. The most important part of the job was getting to meet new people and going home at the end of the day knowing that I did my whole job.

good,"I would stock the cooler first, then rotate donuts and start the cleaning. Every Wednesday I would put away the truck.
