bad,"YOU fetch your material"
bad,"My manager was racist. Even though they held a Masters' they didnt know anything. They never worked well with certain people, other people they would walk out with, then clock them back in. Anything else they didn't care about. Used to be a good company. ?"
bad,"De  cultuur is dat de klant er niet toe doet, alles draait om de sales manager en zijn bonus, de monteur is maar bijzaak,  ze komen niet hun wettelijke verplichting na"
bad,I don't recommend no one to this place.i assumed this job was for me I felt so comfortable till the floor supervisor took that away from me never did nothing wrong but just come to work.i wanted to climb that ladder but they knock me down.
bad,Bad place to work. Won't advance to supervisor if you are African American. Will fire you without hearing your side of the story. If someone complains
bad,You do not want to work here this place is a absolute joke the management is horrible people are fired at left and right people that have been here 3 months to 30 years does not matter they will walk you out with no issues you can only be late three times and you're fired you could not say certain words or wear certain clothes there are all kinds of rules here trust me his place is crazy I've been here almost four years and I'm looking to get out it is not fair what they pay you and all the work you do you will work 12 hours a day for months straight without any days off its dirty also
bad,The heart and spirit of a community ripped out by the corporate raiders who's major claim to fame was inventing bubble wrap.  Other than that a lot of laughs.  Worked with some of the most horrible co-workers in the world.  A real pleasure to come to work each day and be hung out to dry.
bad,"The only thing I enjoyed about this company is some of the people I worked with. "
bad,"Incompetent Management"
bad,"Worked in IT department as FTE. The Management is clueless as to what the priorities are. Frequent re-orgs (4 in last 3 years) with layoffs, otherwise also there is too much Attrition in the team. Micro management in the name of Agile with really hard to meet deadlines. Zero worklife balance and rampant crunch culture. Management likes to take lot of H1 visa guys and make them work  day in day out an expect others to do same.No growth opportunities, lots of Nepotism and politics."
bad,"The planners at this company are terrible. "
bad,Run. Don't work there it's not a good place. Youll start at 14 to 16$ a hour but work swing shifts and overtime alot. They don't care about there people. Just making them money.
bad,"Typically you will arrive to work to find the previous shift doing everything they can to avoid work, leaving you ill prepared to start your shift. If you are night shift (first 3+ years of full-time) then management will not be there when you get to work. There is a huge gap between floor workers and management. Management likes to tell you how to run a machine they do not know how to run, eventually they cut our manning from 3 people to 2 yet expected more changeovers at a faster rate. All about the numbers. There are no supervisors since they use the ""team"" setup. This leaves coworkers with no one to settle disputes or rule on disagreements on how to do something. Co-workers were hit or miss, some great some terrible. Nothing could be done about lazy worthless co-workers since there is no accountability. Hardest part of job was 12hr shifts for me, some like it though. Most enjoyable part was the pay was decent."
bad,Bad place to work. No security with your job and a hostile environment.
bad,Company has struggled greatly to define who and what they are in the past 6-7 years. Company culture doesn’t award bold thinking and achievement. Field management is lacking in vision and support for direct reports.
bad,Horrible manager will never listen to you would rather start middle school drama then fix anything your treated unfairly and Human Resources is a joke
bad,"I'm still employed here (3 year employee) and I (and many others) cannot wait to get out of this place. Don't be fooled by some of the good reviews here. You might even get a good job offer from this company but you will regret working here within only months when you see the culture and poor management.  "
bad,this place ask a lot of it's people. it pays good.it is a fast paced environment. there is a lot of management with in that place that is not needed. the company is top heavy and they have moved a lot of business to mexico.
bad,"Company benefits are great , management is very shady , work is very horrible and fast paced and also very hot inside , the employees there are mostly related"
bad,A typical day at work would be very stressful and full of challenges . The management was very poor and undisciplined. A lot of the departments were very unorganized and not able to meet product time lines. At of safety incidents not properly reported. A lot of mangers are not good teacher or listeners and lack leadership. Many meeting were department problems and issues were discussed were never meet with solutions and would often cause more problems because of that. After awhile it becomes hard to work their with the poor environment and no were to turn for help or guidance within management or human resource department
bad,"In my opinion, this is not a plant that I would recommend to anyone who is seeking fairness, honesty or any other positive characteristics in an employer.   The equipment and environment are antiquated and unsafe.  Rather then address these issues head-on, the plant manager continues to mandate more cumbersome and obstructive PPE to be worn by the employees who are already working in unsafe conditions.  This poses as a direct opposite to the industry norm or standard for such a situation.  The rule is: first make the necessary repairs and upgrades to the equipment and environment; then apply PPE as the final resort."
bad,"I was terminated for having one accident in 21 years of heavy maintenance. I fought management every chance I got. They sent product made in Monterrey Mexico to the plant in Texas and put Texas labels on the Mexico products, Where's the World Class Management and high ethics Sealed Air brags about? I don't see it. I'm glad to be away from them. I just feel for the good people that I worked with. Most are still there and they deserve better."
bad,"muito corrido as vezes não dava tempo nem de ir no banheiro nem beber aguá"
bad,Atmosphere of this company does not foster independent thinking or process ownership. Management tends to rule with an iron fist. Environment is quite hostile.
bad,When I first started in 2016 I had great bosses but by the end of 2017 all that changed and we had a horrible boss that cussed us all the time and never appreciated anything anyone did. Also had issues troubleshooting because management would call our cell phones and not allow us to do our jobs. They pay great but the bs isn’t worth the money.
bad,"They lost a lot of their Experience Personnel. An replaced with Inexperience Personnel, in management roles in company. Overtime was terrible as well. If you reported anything you will be reprimanded. To scare you to stay quite.I hope they address this problem in future."
bad,Very busy place always overtime. Good people to work with and lunch time is pay. Safety always number 1 people will work with propane and butane gas. Growing opportunities are not for every body.
bad,"Employees are expected to do many jobs in order to get work done — with little thanks and no recognition.   "
bad,"Management plays favorites, has unrealistic expectations, no proper training program, no pay raises, low base pay. 2 years = 12 cents. I've always been a hard worker, too."
bad,"In the year that I worked there, I went through 7 different supervisors on different levels. They don't know how to do their jobs, or what to do when there is an issue. The Engineers there are idiots and couldn't find their way out of a paper bag. You can't keep good helpers because they don't pay them enough to do all they are required to do. Operator pay is good, benefits are horrible, drama is everywhere. I would not recommend anyone go work there unless you have no family and actually have the skill set to be an operator. Even then, you can only deal with so much bs."
bad,"This is not an organization, it is a re-organization.  In the last 4 years the company has changed its name 3 times and gone through more re-organizations than can be counted (The Diversey part in SE Wisconsin)."
bad,"Yes, that is a quote from the CEO. Blatant discrimination of experienced workers. They want experienced workers in a 20 something year old. "
bad,Would be great if one man didn't control the entire company.  It's his way or the highway. Every manager is too busy kissing his butt to make good decisions for employees.
bad,"Worked there for 18yrs...new management came in and started cutting benefits, staffing, and increased workload. Employees were forced to work OT...sometimes 10days on,  1 off, and repeated the cycle(12hr shifts)."
bad,"I got into many confrontations with fellow employees. Some felt I worked too hard, some felt the need of profanity as a means to get more out of fellow employees."
bad,"If you're the type of person who would like to work at a job with little or no training, Sealed Air in Hanover PA is the place for you! If you like being screamed at by the operator and lead person, Sealed Air is the place for you. If you like going to work everyday and not knowing what sort of crummy job you'll be forced to do, Sealed Air is the place for you. If you like being lied to and bullied by management, Sealed Air is the place for you. If you like working in unsafe conditions on a regular basis where you might lose a limb or two and be held accountable for your accident, Sealed Air is the place for you! If you like sharing the break room with the resident mice, Sealed Air is the place for you! Other than that, I have no complaints!"
bad,This company does not care about it's employees you are nothing but a number. There insurance is not worth having you work 60 to 72 hours a week. They change the hours you work every 5 to seven years. The good ol Boy system is running rampeed through this company it's all about who you know and who you blow if you want to grow with this company. Stay as far away as you can from Sealedair.
bad,Avoid this place at all costs horrible working conditions compensation is not enough for the amount of BS you deal with.                                Place is a snake pit
bad,"The raises are very small, management is very poorly run, it is impossible to advance in the company. Excessive amounts of mandatory overtime."
bad,"Can learn because you have to do others project work in order to get work done.  Culture is one of the worst I have experienced.  Does not value work life balance.   "
bad,"Long hours and mandatory overtime required."
bad,This company is not a good company to work for. there is too much favoritism there and total lack of incentives. Had to leave as I am older an was no longer able to do the jobs they put me on.
bad,Shift leaders are more educated when it comes to dealing with a variety group of people. They understand not every employee learns at the same pace and are willing to work with you to accomplish your training at a safe and steady pace. Management I would say not so much. They lack the education in ethics and team leadership.
bad,"In der Führung arbeitet man viel zu viel. Bis tief in die nacht und auch an den Wochenenden. Zu einem nicht gerade hohen Gehalt. Weiterbildungen werden nicht unterstützt. Das Management ist alt und eingefahren. Alles ""spezialisten"" von 1920."
bad,"Too many lazy people, too many 7 day weeks, especially during the holidays. No chance for advancement if you're good at where you're at. Site manager plays favorites to those that suck up to him instead of holding them accountable for quality mess ups, extended breaks and lies about why they didn't make production."
bad,"Policies not followed, Proper wear of beard nets and hair nets not followed. Workers Chewing tobacco in production area, also chewing gum and eating candy."
bad,"There are many ,many things can be said about how bad it is there. The biggest thing is that there was no advancement there, stuck in the same position for years"
bad,"Sealed Air relocated its global headquarters to Charlotte NC in 2015 and was rapidly growing its workforce. After selling off the Diversey business in 2017, it started a round of mass layoffs and the current environment, at least in the IT department,  is one of great insecurity and wondering ""who's next""."
bad,"Not a great place to work! A LOT of hours! Strange schedule. Have to work at least every other weekend. Everything is your fault, no matter which way you go."
bad,Worked here for 23 years. Not what it used to be. People are numbers and nothing else. Manag. has no clue. Not a good place for older people to work. I would look elsewhere.
bad,"Working 24/7 to meet the expectations is top priority over work/life balance.  Great employees, but corporate expectations are not very realistic at plant level without resources and support being provided."
bad,Poor communication with manager. No training to excel. Manager complains about the payroll system constantly to the payroll vendor.
bad,"Sealed Air is a large global manufacturing company."
bad,"Sealed Air ruined what once was the very best place to work. No respect for line workers. Little at all for any CRYOVAC employees regardless of their position. They borrowed money from CRYOVAC to buy the company and then ""gutted"" it and filled it with part time help. Compare their market share today to what is was when they ""purchased"" company.  ."
bad,Heureusement que l'on peut travailler le weekend....
bad,"Lacked clarity in all conversations about future. always under-staffed, unreasonable shift times. low pay, even for employees with tenure. constant machine failures."
bad,"If you like having 1 day off a week, working 12 hr nights, then boy is this job for you!"
bad,"Other   than   a   hi   stress   work   environment,   there   was   no teamwork   and   everyone   was   out   for   themselves.  Management  had  know  interests  in  the  concerns  of  the  workers."
bad,"Sealed Air was an easy place to work for, but the job seemed like a dead end with no opportunity for advancement.  Raises were only considered on certain years regardless of how much extra work was placed on you."
bad,"un travail en 3X8 déjà fatiguant que la direction veut faire beaucoup plus avec moins de personnel !"
bad,Es donde se manipula plasticos usas traspale . Y no me acuerdo
bad,When I started working here this was a great place to work. As time went on and the company got bought out by Sealed Air and they changed management it has went downhill. The moral of the company is awful. They change so many things day to day.  They have to much of a buddy buddy system.
bad,"I spent 25 years at Sealed Air. That time went by fast. They were a 1 billion dollar company when I started. They are now in the fortune 250 group and own Instapak, Cryovac and Diversy. Each company is very successful."
bad,"A empresa como um todo é ótima, mas o local onde exerci minhas atividades é estressante, os profissionais não são de bom caráter."
bad,"equipe sympa mais hierarchie complexe, "
bad,"Une société qui Avant avait une âme "
bad,"Other than the pay being great, the job and atmosphere is horrible.  Mandatory overtime is outrageous (72 hour weeks)."
bad,Work environment was very stressful and lack of skilled management created a toxic attitude in the work place. There were lots of great people on staff who worked hard and were easy to get a long with.
bad,"This company shows no loyalty or concern for long term employees and looks to replace long term employees at the first chance given to save on benefits, vacations and pay!"
bad,"good place for a person with no ambition."
bad,"Good pay, great benefits including profit sharing. Worked with many good people. The culture changed over the ten years I was there. There is now too much overtime and not enough people to take care of all that needs to be done."
bad,"Terrible place to work, managers always micro managing. No space to do your job, and NOTHING is ever correct. You work like a dog for peanuts and I've seen them fire someone for simply trying to do there job more efficiently."
bad,"quite possibly the most unhappy group of people I have ever worked with. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. really bad facility, union shop, just not good."
bad,"Upper management has no discipline when it comes to project management. They take the “ready, shoot, aim” approach. Budgets are determined by senior leadership prior to scopes. They expect projects to have contingencies of <1%. The front line management recognizes the lunacy of this approach but appear powerless to effect change. The end result is undue stress on the people trying to execute the work."
bad,"Company has undergone a major culture shift since the most recent CEO came on board. A new global headquarters was constructed in Charlotte relocating many jobs. Building has an open office concept. As senior level talent leaves the company they are not replaced with senior or mid-level talent. The overwhelming majority of Engineers are new graduates. The company does not have a good mix of talent levels. Constant changes and reorganizations have made the company feel unstable, long term viability of the company does not feel strong. The rank and file employees who built the company have low morale."
bad,"Really hard job, 12 hours shift, poor money. I would never ever do it again."
bad,Es una Empresa con mucho futuro y con el proposito de mejora continua.. Siempre estuve al tanto de los metodos para hacer mas eficiente y mas facil mi trabajo tanto pára mi en lo personal como para desarrollar a las personas a mi cargo. Obtuve mi certificacion APICS y logre formar un equipo altamente eficiente y multi-tareas
bad,"Great job with great benefits, but the place is ran by morons with sticks up their rears. If you can do your job well and put up with the idiocracy it is the place for you."
bad,"Repair and maintenance of production machines. "
bad,I learned a lot more about presses than what I knew previously. Fellow co-workers at Sealed Air took the time to teach me since teh presses were different than where I previously came from. The management is not the greatest. The hardest part of the job was getting the trainer to teach me how to make plate material. There seemed to be a excuse everytime I asked to be trained for nearly 18 months and i did go through the chain of command. It wasn't until we got a new plant manager that I was finally trained elsewhere that  should have been trained two years ago.
bad,"I am on the phone a lot and travel extensively in the US meeting customers, prospects and Sealed Air people at meetings, conferences, and at HQ."
bad,Loved the job. Very challenging and fast paced with great benefits. Once current management took over it stopped being enjoyable at all. No collaboration or listening to its employees.
bad,My typical day would be to start up machines. Make bubble take it off and then insert them into boxes and ship them off. then repeat
good,"I enjoyed my actual job tremendously, unfortunately due to changes in company structure, it did not work out."
good,"Controllo budget , controllo presenze operai turnisti , predisposizione invio tecnici , predisposizione eventuali assemblee contatti con banche e enti previdenziali ."
good,Money is good. Home life suffers. Management has no clue. They are starting to treat people like three year olds with all of the ridiculous safety light bars.
good,"It provided me a living and an experience I will never forget. The company did try to do the right thing. Unfortunately people are a different story, it was a clique environment. You had to really know people in order for things to happen in your career."
good,Weak Project Management Team. This should be sufficient information.
good,worked there as a contractor. supposed to be 3 year contract to perm. job was eliminated after a year and a half.
good,"Una empresa con grandes posibilidades de ser pionera en innovación de producto, sin embargo en cultura laboral sin machistas y misoginos ...intentan crear cultura de equidad de género pero el entorno cultural de la zona geográfica puede más que la cultura organizacional ...muy pocas oportunidades de crecimiento . Ambiente frustrante  y limitante, donde predomina el compadrazgo, favoritismo ."
good,Always ReInventing themselves.  Hard to keep up with.  Management is not always easy to deal with and often secretive of upcoming plans.  Workloads not balanced between staff.
good,"Decent pay but insurance isn't anything to write home about. Lack of communication between management and hourly employees. No positive reinforcement from management, forced overtime every week."
good,"Regardless of how much you have contributed to the company over many years, they will cut you if they think they can save a buck.  No loyalty to the older employees whatsoever.  Always trying to replace them with younger, cheaper labor."
good,"If you're employed or contracted into a main office, then chances are your work life will not be too bad. though management is chaotic you do have a lot of freedom and ability to do things your own way."
good,They are splitting the company and the work is done by  contractors. This made it hard with the coming and going of the personnel that were with the company
good,Pretty decent place depending what department you are in. Some departments have very laid back and relaxed rules but some (mine) are very strict and push to get every drop out of you. It has burned me out.
good,"Société à la réputation solide il y a une vingtaine d'années lors de mon embauche, tout a changé ces dernières années, transformé, par un management incompétent, avare de profit au détriment des salariés. N'oublions pas que la plupart du personnel travaille en 3x8, et qu'à force de toujours rajouter des tâches de travail et de nouvelles règles (qui changent toutes les semaines), par un management qui ne connait ni le fonctionnement de notre travail ni la fatigue des horaires décalés, la plupart du ""personnel"" se décourage et vient à reculon, sans plus aucune motivation... Même les intérimaires fuient au bout de quelques jours de travail devant cette pression hiérarchique..."
good,"I loved my position with SAC until our jobs were shipped overseas to save a few dollars for the company. It didn't matter that we worked our tails off for the company, coming in on holidays or working on our vacations. Our jobs were sent overseas. Thanks for keeping the American dream alive for the people that helped take you there."
good,"good to work here we can learn people management as well as work life balance,you have to hard work in the field and you need to manage the customers at late night."
good,"I was hired as a temporary employment and with no option for advancing, laid off after the closing of the Rochester New York plant. I liked the job and coworkers, but the morale was low."
good,"Cette entreprise (Epernon) n'a pas et ne veut pas admettre que l'age d'or est terminée. Ainsi les décisions ne sont pas coordonnées, les ordres contradictoires."
good,"Left in limbo regarding all communications for company choices"
good,work days are laid back and they tend to cater to lazy. You'll learn a lot if you put the effort in but we are finding it hard to find good workers with the younger generation as they have know idea how to do anything for them selves.
good,i have learned machine operative experience and its also a good company to work for if you aint agency
good,I like what I did at this job. The manger doesn’t give his employees the proper time frame for training. Your constantly moving from job to job. If you don’t have the job down packed in two days your fired.
good,Going through significant transformation effort. Challenging to stay under the conditions where next level management aren't sure of their roles and responsibilities
good,Training was sometimes offered. The people are awesome. Management has room for more sensitivity. Factory environment. Work is easy most times but there is a lot of it.
good,"Hot, fast paced. low pay and 12 hr 7-7 shifts. swing work days. no paid lunches and ungrateful staff. impossible to advance unless you have worked there several years and even that may not get you up the ladder."
good,"fast paced and stressful engagements, management team is excellent at creating new processes, but incredibly lacking in executing them. building is poorly ventilated. has a hard time sustaining necessary workforce"
good,"I worked on an assembly line wrapping packaging with chemical foam in it for shipping out merchandise. i worked 2nd shift. the co-workers were friendly but was a language barrier since most of them"
good,Worked primarily out of in email inbox and phone. Tons of emails a day and you are expected to complete to task and confirm immediately to sales or customers or the would become impatient. The struggle was just keeping up with the volume of the work load.
good,its a good place to work and the work load is very light. There does not seem to be any upward motility in the company and the pay is capped once your there thats it.
good,"Generally, an okay place for company employees, not so much for temporary employees. Little or no advancement during my employment. No holidays paid. No benefits for temporary employees either."
good,Their is a lot of drama between employees. Management is very hard and inconsiderate. Do not work for them through a temp agency or you will stay a temp for years not making what you should based off your position because you're a temp.
good,When I began at Sealed Air Corporation I was very pleased. Over the past few years morale has declined and the culture is not what it once was.
good,"Because I was a contract employee, my value was not high, especially toward the end of my work experience there.  The people I worked with daily were great.  In previous years I was highly valued, because I was the first person that many people had contact with when calling - new customers, new employees, vendors, etc."
good,"Great CEO who is driving a lot of change and making it a very competitive work place"
good,"Arrive to our assigned station to help finish orders in a timely matter, Working as a team is imperative in this line of work. Management works alongside the team on a daily basis to make sure product is up to standards. The fact that this job is fast paced and work is always available makes I enjoyable."
good,This company has a great Fabrication shop with well trained equipped personal running the floor. Part of my requirements was to Expedite material that was not produced in time for the production floor to complete the assembly and the shop floor always came through with flying colors. The Assembly group was also extremely versatile and intuited on what they needed to get the job done in a timely manner.
good,"12 hours day -Good"
good,"Travail en 3x8 "
good,"This company has so many big ideas, but hasn’t been able to follow through. If you love a changing environment you will enjoy this company. However, the last couple of years has been a roller coaster of excitement and let down."
good,Used to be a decent place to work at. Now due to so many changes in Management and the work environment it seems not  to be stable anymore. I've been there a long time and it seems there is no room for advancement for some and more for others.  Nepotism is practiced in some areas of the company which is great for some and bad for others
good,"Changing from a team environment to a more unorganized system."
good,I worked here for a decent amount of time and feel i learned a lot about production and manufacturing. I was working with a temp service and decided to pursue a better career.
good,"Senior leadership has no idea what goes on in the organization and they never get input or use it from the working groups.  The culture is very different in NC than it was in SC, there is much less collaboration now and most managers do not know what their employees are doing."
good,"Sealed Air has agreed to sell the Diversey Care Division to Bain Capital Private Equity, which is expected to close the sale in the second half of 2017."
good,"Changing from a team environment to a more unorganized system."
good,This company had a lot of transfer of it's employees. Some of the departments where isolated so company structure was is question. It was sometimes had to know how to go to with everyday company issues.
good,"Company is relocating to Charoltte, NC. I think it is a great move for the company; however, I am unable to move to a different location."
good,Great working environment. Friendly co-workers and atmosphere. Position ended due to the recovery of the individual I was hired to fill in for.
good,"Promising and expecting a lot, yet getting a contract there is, considered by themselves, huge achievement. They barely care about their people and follow only the rules that are benefiting to themselves, because you can always be replaced."
good,Too little direction and support from leadership when approaching change.  Company is not focused on long term objectives that improve the bottom line and improve customer service.
good,Use to be a good place to work but over the years it has gone down.  The work atmosphere has changed with  management.  Good judgment  seems to be gone out the door.
good,"Grosse société de plasturgie qui propose toute une panoplie de métiers. "
good,"company uses contractors instead of hiring full time employees. attitude is contractors are disposable. some contractors have been with the company for many years, always hoping to get hired."
good,"Depending on the area you work in--a lot of old timers who have gone through a lot of transition. Resistant to change, not enough recognition that management is a skillset, not the prize awarded to whoever has the most seniority. No career coaching or development, or feedback. Unable to respond to employee feedback regarding lack of meaningful work or conclusive direction. Stalled career."
good,"Very chaotic environment as the business has been for sale consistently for past decade, and is always under reorganization.   With poorly developed LT and ST strategic goals, that constantly change with every new management team, employee morale is VERY low, and people are constantly leaving the organization.    Hard to get anything done due to so many vacancies within the organization."
good,Long hours and challenging work but a good environment that encourages employees to grow and take charge of their career. Salary and benefits are very good.
good,Management is going through a transition period with a divestiture of Diversey.  Many people have relocated for the company within the past two years.
good,"Took safety very serious, and clean place to work, the managers and supervisors are very nice and helpful. Good place to work yourself up a higher positions"
good,"Small plant that is part of a global company, overall a good place to work, great co-workers that make a good enviroment. It can be difficult to advance within the company due to it's a small plant and most of the employee there haven there for a long period of time."
good,"I was happy with my job until it relocated to Charlotte, taking my job with it.  The 6 years I was there was not too bad, pay was ok.  Did not like how you had to help train new employees but not compensated for it and covering for teammates was difficult to do."
good,"Bonjour, "
good,I found Sealed Air a challenging and rewarding place to work.  Communications within the organization where somewhat broken but I do believe this tends to be a struggle with larger companies. This company moved to North Carolina with little to no notice for over 300 employees leaving a somewhat unsettled morale within the workplace.
good,"Sealed Air's new motto ""Re-imagining a world of less being greater than more"" equates to cutting jobs here in America and giving them to Mexico. Once a great company to work for.....not as good now."
good,Being with the company for so many years and have been able to grow and learn different areas with in.  The management that I have had the pleasure of working with have been very supportive to help in developing my skills.
good,Good pay but extreme temperatures summer and winter. Work with good people.
good,Wouldn't recommend for people not wanting to work 12 hrs a day. Very nice and clean place to work. Very friendly and trustworthy people. Kind of reclusive job though
good,"Correct dans l’ensemble, équipe sympathique, cantine à disposition"
good,"I was a supervisor for 7 years after moving up from a floor position.  This was a great opportunity to grow with the company, but the hours it required was too much.  I worked 60+ hours a weeks a lot of weekends, this took too much time away for my family a wife and two boy's  10yrs and on 4yrs. During one stretch i worked four months with one day off."
good,"Es una empresa semi-estable, la cual su fuerte es fabricar food packaging, los servicios y departamentos secundarios, solo ayudan a mantener los rates productivos."
good,Stay to yourself don’t feed into the gossip it’s as about quality and safety stay focused on the job don’t make friends and you’ll be ok paid breaks gym reimbursement
good,"Sealed Air is an average company to work for. Open office concept, highly chaotic environment.  Constantly changing and cost cutting; not in growth mode."
good,a ok place to work. had good benefits but managed badly. they did offer a lot of cross training which allowed u to continuously move around if not up.
good,The hours are long but its easy work if everything runs good and you have a full staff. Needs better training as well as human resources department. Overall not a bad job just needs fine tuned.
good,Very disorganized management. Must be on time and park your vehicle backwards. There is very little training and hardly any preventative maintenance done
good,"Nice company, they work hard to achieve all goals and have high standards."
good,Was laid off because of poor management and lack clear direction or communication to success in position. Company lack a lot of diversity and advancement opportunities to be global company. Lost a lot of good tenure workforce because of change to a more millennial focus to the work environment and of ability to have management at all levels and supervisors ability to translated true change behavior and priority to team environment.
good,"A typical day for me includes data entry and testing material. I have really learned a lot about making Excel spreadsheets. Management doesn't seem to understand the struggles of the employees. People get trained well and end up taking their skills somewhere else for more pay. The workplace culture is like any other manufacturing place. The hardest part of my job is getting the right information to make decisions, as information seems to come to me in pieces. The most enjoyable part of the job is the laid-back atmosphere."
good,"A typical day at Sealed Air was very busy fast paced, I learned people skills need in today job market having to manage so many different cultures. The work place culture there needs improvement to many unacceptable things going on which was the only thing that made my job as Supervisor difficult."
good,Sealed air is a busy work environment. You must be able to handle a  Fast paced environment. Must be able to multi task and work independently.  You must work holidays
good,management has their favorites and only likes suck ups  you can not be promoted very far. The people you work with are usually friendly but most managers are terrible
good,"This company is pretty good and has a lot going for it in the years to come. The location I am at has a lot of interesting dynamics as it has been bought out by Sealed Air in the past few years. I like working here, but the processes for get work accomplished can be confusing and the direction the local management team wants to go is not always evident."
good,"self managed, manager is overworked, forced to be safety and maintenance manager and too busy to schedule work for maintenance. The employees are mostly very nice. The benefits are pretty good. Get your pre-hire agreement in writing. Mine was changed after I was hired b/c I did not have it in writing."
good,Debido al mal tiempo en Venezuela cerro sus puertas empresa buena de alli tengo lo que tengo hoy dia y no me quejo de haber servido casi 20 años
good,"-Process invoices daily"
good,"Gave me the opportunity to learn many different skills."
good,"I will say this, on a day to day basis this job is great. Dealing with customers and co-workers is a blast and we are out there doing what we love. On the other hand, there is corporate and management. Being an early adopter of any platform is encouraged, but if doing so hurts your numbers they don't care. This company is all about the measurables. They don't care that you took a machine or two that was released way to early into Beta and made it work, or that these machines make you bend over backwards to keep the company looking good. All they care is what was the forecast and where are you in accordance with that. Keep in mind I am saying this coming of a year where I am number one in my region, and no one else is close."
good,Nice place to work.  Learned a lot about the manufacturing business.
good,Sealed Air was a pleasant company to work for with a tech driven mentality to further customers needs. Most of the day included answering phone calls for customer needs and backing up anything sales needed.
good,Good place to work and good benefits. Hours it all depends for what you apply for. Can't complain of my job. Sometimes it gets very busy but it is all good.
good,Making bubble wrap. Learning how to make bubble wrap. You have to learn how to work temperatures to get your correct bubble size and form. You with a team of 3.
good,"Sealed Air has a solid line of protective packaging products with several platforms to give customers the most efficient delivery system. "
good,"While there were many opportunities that provided me the autonomy to make my own decisions, I found that many of the situations were because of a mistake elsewhere in the company that I was having to clean up and make right with the customer."
good,"Management continuing the decline. Years of 2-3% raises causing pay to fall behind chicken plants in area. Because of hiring freeze we are contracting out HVAC job for 3x the cost of hiring someone [to save money?]. The operator turnover is huge, out of 10 people hired,  6 didn’t show up for the interview, maybe 5 make it a month and maybe 3 a whole year."
good,"Responsible for reducing delinquency and reconciling disputes pertaining to outstanding balances."
good,"Not just your 40 hours per week, work 26 days straight then 2 days off. Hardest part is dealing with stress. Good ole' boy system and cliques. Upper management doesn't know what lower level does. Slow about job advancement in some sections."
good,Good environment to work. Especially for fresh graduates. the most enjoyable part is you can go back on time. they look for job efficiency.talented people will have a good career growth.
good,"Was good work, with good people. Unbelievable overtime when the orders were slamming us. Stop treating workes well when they decide to close the plant."
good,manufacturing of bubble wrap and uline products. Long and hot hours. Pay wasn't to bad. High turnover rate though. Fairly decent chance for advancement.
good,It is an ok company. The department wasn't the best. They have a nice new headquarters in charlotte that was just built...............................
good,A hands on learning environment where productivity and results are enhanced.  Excellence in Customer Service is Valued and quality should be reinforced.
good,it was a good job but some people are a little unfair. Some people gossip and some actually do their work. the management was not always fair. When theres  a mistake they need to do proper investigations before accusing anyone. the job was a good place.
good,"A typical day was phones ringing constantly, entering orders and assisting customers with various problems. We also had daily audits and reports that had to be completed as well as working with our production plant in getting our film produced and out the door. We learned multitasking right off the bat. The hardest part of the job was taking responsibility of things outside of customer service territory and keeping our customers happy."
good,Very positive and productive experience.  Committed to the industry and creating a quality work environment.  Always allowed for innovative ideas and welcomed any new and improved ways of working
good,"Okay company, but not much opportunity for advancement.  They do have a credit union for employees.  They also give things like hams at Christmas.  Canteen has pretty good food."
good,"Peut être mieux "
good,"This company is a good company.  If it would not of moved to Charlotte, NC I would stay with the company.  I enter orders, answer the telephone and talk to customers."
good,"The company being a market leader in the region for cleaning and Hygiene solutions, has an excellent workplace culture in terms of freedom of managing you own work. However there is a high work / personal life imbalance due to the scope of work, especially for sales department."
good,They want a good days work for a small check. They spend more time blaming people for errors instead of encouraging them. They dont alwys see the potential in everyone.
good,A typical day involved processing invoices and helping customers.  I learned  SAP while there.  The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing from happy customers.
good,"all were very supportive as i was very new to overall work flow"
good,"This is a great company that has lots of potential, but there is a lot of things that are not managed well such as staffing and fair pay."
good,As a field sales you are independent and it's important to follow up the customers and perform active prospection in the sector.
good,"I loved my work in SealedAir, could work very good with my team. "
good,"Sealed Air creates a world that feels, tastes and works better."
good,"Work life is good.  New leadership is moving things in the right direction.  Decisions are being made faster..."
good,"Sealed Air is a very large company and the building I worked in was also very big.  It was impossible to get to know everybody.  I also like to have a view of the outside world which I did not have.  However, the people were very easy to get along and work with."
good,"Long Hours"
good,good working conditions. hard to evaluate as contract employee.
good,It started out rough. I was yelled at and talked down to multiple times. Until i finally stood up for myself. It was a good job until jealousy came into play by the upper management. I knew how management is supposed to treat their employees and i do not  believe they liked that to much. I called them on their bs so to speak
good,"Sealed Air is a company in transition as it looks to re-create itself and its culture in a new economic climate and competitive marketplace.  In a large, global, company implementing impactful change across the enterprise poses a challenge.  For any individual who is interested in being part of such a program; Sealed Air is a great opportunity."
good,"Good people, suspect processess arising from too many corporate changes in too few years"
good,"I working as a technical team leader, for polyethylene foam product also working as safety coordinator. working hard for this department to get good product. Always working as team and some times working alone . good for me for experience and for me go more higher for my better life."
good,a typical day at work is a good day .what i learned run a machine on a daily basis plan and analyze work orders and prioritize production goals.i acting as advocate with management for safe production environment.i work well with others working together as a team.getting the job safely done is the enjoyable part of the job.
good,what you would expect and there was stuff to do with the things whenever the work had to be done with the papers and documents every day except sundays with lunchtime
good,"Sealed Air....A once innovative company is in the process of falling. I had a great experience at the local level. The management was great and a wonderful culture is in the plant. The main issues are with the upper management. A good ole buddy system with mulitple layers of dead weight. There will be a lot of ""lifers"" move on in the next couple of years and Sealed Air will feel the effect. There lack of vision and poor talent development and retention will be their downfall. The packaging side of the business will have the greatest pressure to respond to up and coming competitors and time will tell how and if they can react."
good,"Change over of shift worked 12hours on the production line which is called a excrusion. became a Fire team leader, Social Club committee member, Health and safety Rep and trained to write risk assesments"
good,"The work there is easy for the most part, mainly dexterity. Management though is completely lazy and incompetent. Dont expect things to get fixed or problems with other employees to be solved"
good,"While I truly enjoy the team, the organization is incredibly bureaucratic and stuck on ""the way we do things"". There is significant opportunity to drive the business forward, but the org will need to overcome legacy thinking and start acting like they could lose the number one spot in the market."
good,société axée sur les compétences et non sur le niveau scolaire. Possibilité d'évolution
good,Sealed Air is going through a lot of changes and management has been hostage to Wall Street quarterly result criteria that is causing discomfort and lower morale.
good,"There have been a lot of changes within the company over the last five years.  Acquisitions, relocation and now selling off divisions.  This makes people nervous and there are people with years of knowledge and experience leaving.  At the same time those sticking it out through the transitions are not able to move up.  It is difficult to transitions from individual contributor to management in this company.  It also seems with the all the talk of diversity and disrupting the business the people that are being hired and promoted are the same as who are there.  That is the opposite of disruption and diversity."
good,"This company provides flexible working time and consider with the personal or family time. They also allowed me to learn many aspects in the Supply Chain division, however due to many complexities of the organization structure, sometimes you have to report to many superiors. "
good,"They are trying to displace senior operators as myself, and replace us with lesser qualified personnel.  They are hiring them at a lesser pay rate.  This job takes several years to become proficient, and it involves the process of making food packaging.  Therefore it's now something to be taken lightly.  The bottom line is you get what you pay for."
good,"Salário e benefícios compatíveis, ótimo lugar para aprendizado, ambiente agradável."
good,The place is ok the company uses its employees. Is a great place to work at but not many people get hired and the  one who are hired get treated different.
good,Hard to adjust to 12 hour nights and weekends. Worked a lot of overtime and learned many additional skills in different areas.
good,"Fast paced, multi-tasking environment. Excellent people to work with and nothing really to worry about--except 12 hour shifts. Management is good on third shift good and the people are fun, outgoing and excellent to work with. Company has excellent benefits upon hire and excellent retirement and 401k plans."
good,"It's a great job if you can afford to wait awhile going through a temp service. I blew my retirement from my last job trying to survive while going through the temp service. I just ran out of that, and sold my car to pay a couple more months rent trying to survive on a couple more dollars than minimum wage."
good,productive but never was really trained properly  i ddid not work there very long the supervisor i had jeff was very patient in showing me how to do certain things he was  all ways helping the employees out
good,"Travail et équipe"
good,"Work-life balance isn't a luxury. It's a necessity. And they were good at making sure we could manage both. Work compensation was excellent.They make sure if we were hurt or had a baby,we still had a way to take care of our bills."
good,"The excitement this company delivers is just endless.  Wow, every day I went to work was the best day of my life.  They make the greatest product you can imagine."
good,société agréable où l'évolution est possible en mettant en place des formations (type anglais) dans ces locaux
good,"I provide top notch customer service, order entry, account and order information, as well as product suggestions and information. I correspond with my distributors and sales reps by email and phone. The fast pace of daily tasks has allowed me to sharpen my multi tasking skills. I was hoping  for more advancement opportunities when I relocated to Charlotte to work at Sealed Air's new Corporate Headquarters."
good,One manager was very good that worked there. Some employees like to manipulate things and are sneaky. I liked my co-worker.
good,Good place to work and earn a decent wage while learning the Load Management System and its inner workings. Good management and starting wage. Upward mobility is possible with a degree.
good,"A valued time at this employer."
good,"I enjoyed working there, only the opportunity to grow there was poor."
good,"Challenging work and good work opportunities just that work and personal can not be handled well. "
good,It is a good company to work for the only down part is that management is not the best.The work is easy the person doing packing needs to be fast is a fast paced job.
good,"Sealed Air/ Diverseycare, was a great company when the Johnson family owned it. Once it got sold, every thin promised to you went out the window. You were on road five days a week, only saw your family on weekends. no advancements,  raises only happen to same people each year."
good,One of my favorite jobs. The work from home was nice bonus. The people on  my team are . The hardest part is new management. Great benefits and the new campus is nice.
good,"I was young when I started at Sealed Air.  They paid for my education, even though the dont do well at advancing employees from within the company.  This place taught me i hate manufacturing, so I would not return"
good,"It was a just come in and do your job then leave type of job workers are not really fun to be around so too are the management staff,"
good,It's a shame what the greed and lack of intelligence in upper management is doing to this once great company. We are now vulnerable to a corporate take over or bankruptcy....
good,"Empresa ótima de se trabalhar! Recebe bem seus funcionários, tem reuniões, atividades e festa de final de ano."
good,I ran a machine for 12 hours on nights. I enjoyed most of my co-workers and enjoyed running a machine. When I started the management team was good to work for and then they began to hire management that didn't really know what working in a factory entailed.
good,"Uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar porém não tem oportunidade, para seguir carreira."
good,"Had problems with other workers in different departments and my word was not taken for what it was, They value getting their butt kissed rather than having the work done correctly."
good,Great company to work for when starting out. Several areas for advancement. The leadership team has  downsized over the years. The plant manager changes every 5 years and hires new leadership each time. Difficult to build a career under these conditions.
good,"Population de plus de 800 personnes principalement masculine. "
good,"If you don't mind working extremely hard for good money, this is the place for you. Watch your own back and stand up for yourself though, or you'll get ran over."
good,"Hires smart people and uses them accordingly. Sees patterns in business trends and reacts looking to the future spending dollars in R & D, developing products to be used and valued in future. Recognizes that not all these future looking products will be hits but plans accordingly and takes risks to ensure overall success."
good,"The Opportunities are there for the ones that come into the job looking to be successful. "
good,"In the last year Sealed Air in Simpsonville received a new CEO and plant manager. I have talked with the plant manager, and his ideas and goals for the plant are good. The down side is he has to get corporate to work with him. In a whole Sealed Air is a good place to work. Like all companies they have their flaws, but none of which can not be over come."
good,I really enjoyed my position as a Quality Control technician. I learned a lot from my colleagues. Just like anything it could have always been better.
good,"Sealed Air was once a wonderful place to work.   After years of being a premier employer, they have taken on the mantra less with more.  Employees have gone  from being an asset to being just a Cog."
good,"Typical day at work would include communicating with customers regarding aged or current account balances. Drafted thorough understanding of the Sealed Air customer consignment, and order process, while facilitating calls to accounts, sets up meetings with customers and the National Account Mgr., suggesting new process to effect the reconciliation of past due receivables for my assigned portfolio. Prepared G/L documentation for A/R Month End reports to review with management. Also preparing write off details for both bad debt and sales adjustments with detailed explanation.  Researched misapplied payments, short paid invoices, duplicated credits, freight issues, and sales tax adjustments to determine root cause solutions. Developed and maintain professional working relationships with National Account Managers, Outside Sales Associates, Branch Supervisors and National Account Coordinators to coordinate credit and reconciliation activities."
good,"Very fast moving place to work, very tight deadlines. No waste on materials. Yield must always be up. I ran the whole of plant 2 i enjoyed it. But the downside would be i did""nt get enough support."
good,"The last few years we all experienced a major shift in the Company.  A new campus was built in Charlotte, NC and the Diversey Brand was spun off in Q3 2017, making for a smaller business.  "
good,The job was so easy but management made it so hard. There is no work life balance and no display of appreciation. I loved the customers and my job function. Once goal was met there were no thanks you's or you all did a great job . They only harped on what you could have done better. They weren't fair to all employees and made exceptions for who they wished to. Again this was a great job and atmosphere I think I just got into the wrong department and that department has since been sold and no longer a part of Sealed Air.
good,If you don't mind 12 hr shifts then you'll love it. The pay is good.Decent job security. The staff is pretty good. The job is fast paced and competitive.
good,"Worked with a great customer service team totaling 206 years of experience before being laid off."
good,"Faced paced environment, need to be self motivated each an everyday. There is a lot of opportunity for internal growth. Co-workers are easy to get along with and willing to work together."
good,Great Place to work.  Managers tend to use their feelings to dictate outcomes rather than rational thinking.  Ideas from non-management employees are often used by managers to get ahead.
good,"great company, fortune 500, great benefits. work from home was very convienent. management micro manages, team leads dont assist. no compensation for employees only upper management.,"
good,Good workplace but a lot of changes have happened over the last year such as a new head quarters. The company is growing mainly oversees
good,"Great colleague relations. Management relations with employees needed some attention."
good,Large company with potential for personal growth. Company salary and benefits are great. As an account manager dealing with clients and the company leaves little room for personal time.
good,Great place to make your mark. Fast paced production job with great pay and competitive benefits. Team based environment that promotes friendships while increasing integrity and productivity.
good,"sealed air was a great work place which helped me grow as a person and gave me a better idea in to the warehouse environment. I learnt a lot working for sealed air. I learnt how to pick stock and prepare for dispatch. i also learnt about quality control, i had to check material and make sure it was at a high quality. my every day tasks included picking, wrapping and building stock then processing through SAP. We had to then load the vehicles with our goods and make sure they are safe. The other side of the job called production, was providing material to the machines and making sure they were always running. The tasks for this job were collecting material, loading machines, stock checking and quality control. I had a lot of fun working on production which i made my own after one year. I enjoyed learning a lot about the materials and the machines. I was able to find a system that would benefit me and the workers on the machines, we had very good communication which benefited both parties and helped the machines and figures run better, which is why we had such high figures when i worked on production."
good,"El trabajo es físico y en serie, típico de una fábrica. Todo el personal muy trabajador y implicado con la empresa. La dirección respeta muy bien los tiempos de descanso, horas de entrada y de salida."
good,"- Food Technologists with 14 years of experience in Sr. Management"
good,"Great company to work for. Good management, great compensation and benefits."
good,"Management is great. We work together as a team to get the job done.I like the fact that it is busy. I enjoy working with customer service, sales, and the carriers to make sure customers' orders are shipped on time."
good,"The work as a whole is fairly straightforward. Training was good for the most. The night shift was very difficult to get used to, it is a 12 hr shift. Issues with the warehouse would only be addressed with empty commitments. Mandatory overtime with only a days notice makes it near impossible to plan anything for your days off."
good,Great people to work with. Every one who works there has been with the company for 10 years or better. That shows you that once you it is a good and stable company who pays well and has a good work community.
good,A typical work day at Sealed Air consists of constant movement and working together to complete the task at hand. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the heat during the summer and the cold during the winter.
good,"Sealed Air has been a great company for me during the past 11 years.  I have grown within the company and enjoyed many opportunities. Most recently I have been in charge of the operational Customer Service team in North America, recently re-branded to Customer Experience.  In this job and in previous jobs Sealed Air has given me the opportunity to learn and grow in project management, problem solving and leadership skills.  If you want to and demonstrate capability, opportunities are present at Sealed Air."
good,"Lots of changes going on so hard to figure out direction  and future.  Usually changes year to year, some switching of accounts to affect income , great people"
good,"Pro's:"

good,"Empresa com mentalidade inovadora,"
good,The company is going through a restructure and they have auditors that follow us every day. Working on the machines is like most companies. I like the work schedule and they are on top of training.
good,Great place to show what you are made of. Be the best at what you do and you will be rewarded at the end. Definitely give you the opportunity to learn.
good,"Worked in Accounts Receivable for a little over 5 years. Highly innovative team oriented department. Multi..-million dollar level of cash applications, including ACH, Wire Transfers, & checks.

good,"Good solid company, good benefits, job advancement for those willing to work for it."
good,"Company offers good pay, benefits,  401k, flex spending and more. The company does a lot to keep employees safe and they will go overboard to make sure you go home safely everyday."
good,"Working here was great for the most part, the only down fall was the low salary and almost no rook for advancement. The culture there was positive with many employees having been a long time"
good,Sealed air was a good steady job. It was a fast-paced job steady work yeah opportunity to learn different things what different machines the pay wasn't that great but it was steady and it got me do it through until I could do better.
good,"My current job is pretty low key, and can be stressful at times due to systems not working properly. "
good,Sealed air Valued hard work but they lost focus. Lots of management changes led to some shenanigans. There were many opportunities to learn new things and improve skills
good,I remember Sealed Air was good to me and gave me lots of training opportunities.  I was grateful for my time there to learn corporate culture.  Fascinating product and great people who were appreciated!
good,"Sealed Air is a very strong company and is the market leader globally in plastic packaging for food use. "
good,"A company moving toward IT reliance on artificial intelligence, Big Data and Machine Learning solutions. Management is quick to make decisions and expects quick response to issues. Project management is a combination of waterfall and Agile methodology."
good,"16+ hour days were normal during quarter and annual closes, but everything else was great. The coworkers were friendly and helpful, and management knew what they wanted but were fair enough to let you do it without micromanaging."
good,"To much overtime, not enough family time. Need to try and help the people on the floor balance the time with work and family. You can make a lot of money if you want to live in the work place."
good,Sealed Air spends a lot of money buying software to evaluate employee performance and skills. Family oriented with a flexible schedule working hours. The hardest part of the job is they reorg every year which causes issues with employees.
good,"Travail d'été, sans grand rapport avec les études mais permet de découvrir les différents milieux du travail"
good,I loved working at Sealed Air.  I learned a lot and was allowed to participate in projects that furthered the learning experience.  I would do it all again in a heartbeat.
good,"This is a very productive workplace but the Hours did not work for me at all, 12 hour shifts 3 days on 3 days off 1 day on 1 day off. Could not get a good sleep schedule down and was always fighting to stay awake, making it unsafe for me to work there."
good,"It is a decent place to work that pays well for the work done. The work can be a little physical, but not overwhelming. But, the management could be better."
good,Great place to work. Its like a family atmosphere. Alot of good people. I would definitely work there again. Great team work to get them old extruder running
good,The company is overall a great place to work but more of the corporate functions are being outsourced here than any other place I've worked before. So it's great until they can fulfill your role someone where that's lower cost. It's not only the manufacturing jobs leaving the country.
good,"Atuei na área financeira, não tinha uma rotina padrão, onde acumulei conhecimentos por atuar em todas as áreas como, contabilidade, custos, fiscal, contas a pagar, contas a receber, crédito, auditorias "
good,Société assez fiable mais certains management pas très capable malheureusement
good,"Desarrollarme en el área de Calidad, buen ambiente laborar, la cultura es muy buena."
good,"The job is overall a nice job, however it was quite mismanaged. I would recommend this job to older people, it can be a bit much for a younger worker."
good,"Höga krav på avkastning, tuff arbetsmiljö. Mycket och kortsiktig rappotering."
good,"Excellent work life balance."
good,"It is typically very busy always receiving or shipping material. I learned how to operate a forklift and safely pack parts. It is a very engaging job that makes you have to be attentive at all times. Grate coworkers willing to help you out when needed. The hardest parts of the job is the amount of time you have to be standing usually most of the day .The thing i enjoyed the most was interacting with all people that come through the department like truck drivers, or costumers coming to see how we ship our product."
good,Fast-paced work environment that you have to make quick decisions for the companies best interest.  Worked my way from the bottom of my department to as high as I could go within my work area.
good,"Empresa trasnacional, con muy buenas prestaciones, ellos mismo reconocen que los sueldos son bajos, la empresa esta cambiando, un poco burocrática para el desarrollo agíl de las ventas."
good,Checked rolls of papers and glue stations before beginning. Checked machine for setup and running. Inspected cushioned envelopes for correct cutting and for defects. Boxed the cushioned envelopes for shipping. Stacked boxes on pallets for shipping. Shrink wrapped pallets for shipping.
good,Management expects you to deliver results without watching you every step on the way
good,"Was a great place to work until the econonmy collapsed. Management is very poor because of the lack of experience and unfair judgement of thier employees, it was once a very good system until they downsized and changed management now it's micromanaged."
good,"I'd clock in, verify paperwork, verify line operations. Inspect materials,machinery and finish product. Insure personal protective equipment is correct."
good,"Great place to work. company is looking to move ahead in the marketplace. provides products to larger, well-established companies. Upper Management does a great job of communicating the vision of the company"
good,"The only problem is that the management in India has never been stable. Other than that it was a great company to work with, not one ones work gets appreciated at the global level but also emulated."
good,Sealed air was a good place to work although I feel like management could be a little more supportive in trying to help employees when complaints are brought up
good,"I enjoy working here, almost every job is easy to learn, and makes good money for the area $18-24 an hr. The co workers are great and management will work with you for the most part. Paid lunch 30 min, with two 20 min breaks through day. 5 sick (personal) days a year with ability to round them up to 15 days if not used. Vacation given anywhere from 2-5 weeks plus paid holidays and 2 floating holidays to use whenever. (So all together I get about 35 days off a year) Overtime is available for those who want it throughout the year. Advancement possible throughout the plant, rarely management however. 3 different shifts (7-3)(3-11)(11-7). You’ll have some bad days, considering the main machines are ancient in age but most co workers help each other out, and most days aren’t bad at all. Paid weekly, with decent benefits including health, dental, vision, 401k."
good,"Diversity of audit assignments was great!  I was involved in so many parts of the company, auditing virtually every department. I was able to be involved in IT audit also so my skills stayed sharp."
good,La empresa es muy buena un ambiente de trabajo muy bueno las prestaciones son muy buenas pero requiero promoción y por ende ganar mas dinero

good,I learnt a lot during my internship there about engineering and got a better experience of how things work in the industry. The company is thriving with all sorts people from different countries and you learn more about how things are done in different places
good,At one point in time at the Scotia plant we were running 7 extrusion lines. We had a great team. It was more like a family than a factory full of workers. We always had fun and still followed all the required safety policies. In Louisville we had 4 extruders. There was not much of a family attitude there. Completely different work culture and work ethic.
good,"Goede werksfeer"
good,"Empresa que passou por inúmeros processos de fusão, o que dificulta a manutenção de uma cultura própria. Apesar disso, durante o período em que fiz parte do time, se mostrou uma empresa extremamente séria, cumpridora de seus compromissos, e principalmente formadora de recursos."

good,"As a contractor for Day and Zimmermann at the Sealed Air Corporation in Simpsonville, S.C. I was a member of a team that worked to improve blown film lines. My daily responsibilities involved but were not limited to the installation of new machinery, the overhauling and maintenance of existing machinery, development of oil and gas lines, modification of existing processes, and various fabrications to extend the life of existing machinery. During this job I learned many skills such as troubleshooting techniques, problem-solving methods, and how to effectively and efficiently communicate with a diverse group of people.

good,"Ein guter Arbeitgeber mit sozialer Einstellung. Aber durch die Übernahme durch einen Weltkonzern wird die Arbeit immer mehr von Bürokratie ""torpediert"". Kundenorientiertes Verhalten ist fast nicht mehr möglich, da zu viele Vorschriften im Hintergrund berücksichtigt werden müssen. Whistle-Blower-Mentalität."
good,"Sealed Air was an excellent environment. The co-workers are good friends and the company promotes this comradery by planning team meetings, work, activities and games. The specific job I held was to field questions about payments from vendors. Many were not agreeable to the terms. This position had to answer for every mistake made by any AP rep keying invoices, purchaser who did not fully inform the vendor of the terms, and changes made to policies that were not communicated to everyone. Often the purchaser (who has authority over terms) would send the vendor to the vendor services line for terms issues when AP had no control over the terms. The vendor would get frustrated at the runaround. Upper management was impeccable, but new lower management was very unethical. They brought in friends from past jobs and pushed out tenured employees."

Durante la giornata effettuavo i dovuti controlli qualitativi sul prodotto, oltre naturalmente ai rapporti con il personale addetto, col magazzino e manutenzione ove questo necessitava, quindi bolle con richieste di materiali per l'assemblaggio delle serrature a magazzino, piuttosto che richieste di interventi da parte del reparto manutenzione , quando le problematiche di risoluzione di carattere tecnico dei macchinari, esulavano dalle mie competenze.la parte più difficile del mio lavoro poteva presentarsi nel momento in cui si presentavano inceppamenti dei macchinari, per cercare di comprendere dove stava il problema.la parte più piacevole del lavoro erano i rapporti con i colleghi all'interno dello stabilimento."

good,"The best part of working at Sealed Air is the culture of the organization - after working there for four years it is clear many care deeply about their job, the company, and customers.  The company has decent compensation compared to its competitors but is low compared to the geographic area it is located.  Recent challenges in the company's Product Care Division are a major drag on the other more profitable division and will likely result in the company continuing to shrink, a trend started in 2017.  Overall I would recommend as a great place to work in the short term (next 5 years) however growth opportunities beyond that may be limited as the company continues to shrink and return cash to the market via share buybacks."
