bad,"Ho lavorato con applied per 2 anni su turni di 12 ore di notte e di giorno ! Spesso ho saltato il pranzo e la cena. Il training è una farsa non vi è un vero trainer e tutto lo devi imparare sul campo se qualche tuo collega è disposto a insegnarti se no rimani al punto di partenza. Un ambiente fatti per intimi conoscenti in cui solo chi è amico di qualche manager può fare carriera. Il trattamento non è dei migliori ti trattano come un principiante e sei considerato pari a 0. Qui le conoscenze la fanno da padrone. Gli obbiettivi sono una finzione che  solo alla fine dell anno ti accorgi di averli, in poche parole non te li fanno e alla fine dell anno ti dicono che non sono stati raggiunti non sapendo nemmeno quali erano. Nel complesso una azienda per amici"
bad,"-No room for improvement "
bad,One of the worst companies that I have had pleasure to work for and taught me a good lesson of what is important. First of all it’s very ancient company with political driven top down approach. Broken into business units where they hardly speak to each other and culture depends on which business unit you would go. They portray and have false image of great place to work but in truth not a great place for ambitious young millennials.
bad,"The onboarding took over a month. The manager took a very long time to tell me i got the job. First day i cane in and sat, they do not have training for employees. They had me leave way from Cedar park almsot to Hwy w90 to do a drug testm i apparently was supposed to do that before starting but wasnt informed until i reportef in to work 3 hrs later. The manager stated i would be paid fullday.  But i havent recieced oaymwbt and they havent returned emails or callss."
bad,"My comments only applies to DDP department. I've heard good feedback from other departments, but in this department not a single engineer is happy. Extremely long work hours including evening, night and weekends and lots of unrealistic deadlines. A lot of micromanagement, several managers/directors will ask you to do different things and want to see update the next day. Pay is low compare to the high intensity of the job. Only a few managers have people management skill. "
bad,"It is a lousy company to work for including the lousy management that they do not know how to manage "
bad,"Save yourself the trouble, don’t bother.  Lack of structure, no guidance, it’s sink or attempt to swim. Try a reputable semiconductor conductor company like ASML, maybe even LAM."
bad,"Don't look back just RUN!! If I could give zero or negative stars I would. This is by FAR the most poorly managed company I have worked for, and I have worked for a few. No possibility for advancement. You never know what your schedule will be until the very last minute. You have no life because you can't plan anything in advance. The negatives go on and on, and the positives are few. "
bad,"Don't care about work life balance just work people to the ground, 13 days straight at 1 minute & then less than 40 hrs a week the next schedule crazy"
bad,The management and training policies need updating. No structure within the company for their new hires. I recommend that they get a training supervisor.
bad,This company will grind u to the bone. Their leadership is inept. They have little regard for work life balance. Way too many managers per employee. I hated every minute up until the point where i needed to train my Indian counterparts to take over my work.
bad,I worked for a small local semi conductor company until purchased by Applied. I think that they're a bigger machine than the federal government. Benefits have spiraled only to fatten the big guys at the top.
bad,"•	Responsible for the release and management of the engineering change order for assigned Business unit and product families from initial supplier problem statement, solution statement through implementation and execution of the engineering change."
bad,"I left this job because of extreme harassment- all parties involved in the harassment were fired shortly thereafter."
bad,worked on R&D Prototype project Pasma Etch machine open &friendly atmosphere an opportunity to learn an exciting new project with a highly skilled staff and Department Manager cannot recall most difficult phase of project at this time. A most highly enjoyable place to work would do so again if the opportunity arose
bad,Too many managers and up that got beat up as children. Major lieutenant style power trips. Literally will try to destroy an employee to prove they own you at all costs. Beware
bad,Worked 12 hours a day and most weekends and management was not happy. Three times a day that i had to report what i am working on. Meetings start at 5:00 pm and usually go pass 9:00 pm.
bad,"Salary did not reflect duties and expectations of job role....information on work details and effective training were not always available. The management lack direction, motivation and support of team members."
bad,"Wow what a boy's club, if you're not in it you're screwed.  Management acts like they care, they will gladly throw you to the wolves and not miss a beat"
bad,"Company is okay, as long as you dont mind cry babies and tattle tails. I dont mind the hours be nice if you had managers who show up to the facility. Other than employees and employers fantastic job."
bad,"Highly Political."
bad,"Not a good department. Training is not good at all. If you like working with older grumpy ladies, then this is the department for you."
bad,Applied Materials is mostly known for their hardware. This review is not for the hardware side of their company. Currently they have a software side but they are laying off resources in that part of the company to fast for it to survive. Generally it was a great place to work with a lot of friendly people but they just don't have the resources to keep up with demand anymore.
bad,"Depends on your manager, mine made me hate 95% of my days at work with constant negativity, irrational accusations, downplaying my abilities, and constant voice raising.  "
bad,"you do not want to know. Manager is very bad. care about his own relaxing . nothing to do with company benefit nor his employees . 0 training, they lied to me"
bad,"They try to capture you and force you into a corner with promises of advancement, despite you showing your skills towards higher potential.  You have no idea what hours you're working for the next day until hours before the end of the day.  Sometimes they'd send contractors home 4hours only of pay.  Other times you'd be packing up to leave at 8hrs, then they'd walk over and tell you to work 10s.  Management is indecisive on process improvements, yet expect continuous growth on a department level."
bad,"Least caring company I have ever worked for. Long contracts, no benefits and little guarantee of being hired after. Management hurries the manufacturing process and ignores obvious engineering mistakes."
bad,"People work so hard that there is no work/life balance at all, however their effort is not always recognized. Overall first level and second level managers don't have vision. There is politics everywhere. The culture of the company is getting worse and worse. A lot of good and experience people have left since their value is not appreciated and the company just keeps hiring new NCGs."
bad,Experienced a lot of training that advanced my skills with using new programs related to reliability engineering to work with suppliers; I worked with supplied to develop reliability and quality requirements to assure product is reliable and consistent with current product specifications.
bad,I like the work and the people there but it was not a secure place to work. I'ts non stop work but they will lay you off at any time with notice or not
bad,"As a paralegal, you will not find yourself advancing at all. There are no opportunities for development or growth. You will always find yourself questioning what exactly you are doing there because your voice will never be heard unless you are an attorney. All paralegals are treated as administrative assistants and there is a lack of motivation or acknowledgement."
bad,Management has poor communication style where everyone is publicly ridiculed. It is not a positive & motivated environment to work in.
bad,"This was my second go round with amat this time in a different division, in the beginning i had managment that i trusted. then later management changed and so did the level of trust.My coworkers in my immediate group were excellent to work with,they shared knowlege and giving tips. Engineering group was good in supporting issues from the customer.Favoritism was very obvious in this division,i thought it would past but its hardwired into the culture. Seen many coworkers layed off some were replaced by H1B visa holders. That never made sense to me. I got my layoff notice whlie i was in Korea at a customer site. Just a cold hard fact of this industry. I do miss the good people that i worked with ."
bad,"As a customer engineer, management does not put me in a position for career advancement. They expect you to stay in the same position for years before they consider you for promotion. The hours worked are horrible and they refuse to hire more people. More often than not, you will be working alone for 12 hour shifts for 5 days straight, while switching between day and night shifts every month."
bad,Amavo il respiro internazionale che c'era; il mutual trust and respect tipico delle aziende straniere; il relazionarsi con lingue e culture diverse; decisioni manageriali che hanno portato ad un drastico cambio del quotidiano e dell'azienda stessa portando un generale stato di insoddisfazione e mancanza di sentirsi parte del gruppo/progetto e del sentirsi engaged
bad,"Learned about business development"
bad,Dead end job for sure. Horrible pay for the work expected. Mcdonalds management puts these managers to shame.
bad,AMAT use to be a great place to work. Too many layoff. A lot of good people have worked there.
bad,They don't hire full time. As a temp you kinda get push around and have to do the things no one else wants to do. No one wants to help you. It was hard to get trained.
bad,"Cooperation culture is nothing particular to speak of. It is a relative efficient company for its size. Career paths are diversed, either work hard with lots innovation, Or, focus on relation talking a lot. You got your promotion. Good to learn to be a self starter, since manager won't help. In the end of day, you get the money. Nothing else!"
bad,Some departments are okay to work for. Other departments are known for burning through engineers. Be careful which group you choose. Also know that the industry goes through cycles and bad times can get really depressing.
bad,"After 5 years at applied. Hey we’re bringing people in the door with less experience and getting paid significantly more than tenured people. It’s a big corporation with big corporation management ideals. Everyone is very expendable. especially when you start making a livable wage, if you ever make it that far."
bad,"Applied Materials has always been known in the industry as a company to work for if you want to be compensated well and unhappy.  Management tends to side with Leads over on site CE's, and expectation is that what the lead says goes.  This can be a good thing if you have a lead who has emotional intelligence, but if you get stuck with a lead that doesn't, can make for a very unenjoyable workplace."
bad,Off shore any operation at the drop of the hat. Petty empire building. Hidden agendas. A company too large and complex for most of it's employees to know what was going on.
bad,"Work 7 day on 2 off.  No benefits.  Contract employee do the work for the full time daytime shift.  Permanent positions go to temporary daytime shifts regardless of experience, night managers get blamed for daytime performance shortfalls.  Highest payed temporaries are layed off 1st."
bad,"Schedule work is irregular depending on work orders and cancellations. Middle management and immediate leaders all are mediocre at best, maybe some bribery involved some leaders. Accommodation for break time is above and beyond. You can't find any permanent job there by mean of hard working and expereinces. Playing politic is the best survivor tools."
bad,You work hard in a professional environment.  I found this company a refreshing change and recommend it.  A large part of the company is based on contract workers so you have constant change.
bad,"Applied is the leading manufacturer of capital equipment in the era of nanotechnology. Employees are highly qualified and pushed to perform constantly. There is an attempt by senior management to improve employee communications and employee satisfaction - atleast on paper."
bad,The position advertised here (field service) is vastly over-rated. It's all who you know. They have their favorites and that will never change as long as the current management team is there. Huge drug culture and management doesn't care. Guys who do a below-average job are constantly rewarded.
bad,"Need to learn thing on your own, must be really proactive & thick skin. Help is limited as most colleagues are selfish, all for themselves. But environment is good & cozy."
bad,Filling this is out is not relevant to my posting of a resume on Indeed. I work for a contracting company for Applied Materials because they would rather outsource the technical jobs
bad,"This is a fast-changing, hard-charging culture. The company ramps and RIFs very frequently, just because of the accelerating business cycle. This has damaged Applied's reputation in Silicon Valley, but also ensures that those who survive are really tough and resilient."
bad,"The current direction the company is going is focusing less on work performance and practicality. The focus has been on busy work that restricts the employee from completing the job they were initially hired for in a timely and low stress manner. Employee support and backing decreases each year leaving a feeling of abandonment. Employee understanding, utilization, experience, and satisfaction has been significantly decreasing as a one size fits all role is being forced on all employees."
bad,Contract companies are difficult sometimes.  The pay is low (although that could be part of the contract with the company that is using the contract).  Benefits are almost nil.
bad,"I am into leading 2 people team as a Technical lead - facilities data package. We are into process of creating facilites installation template and layout for the tools used to manufacture wafers in semi conductor industry. The tools used are AUTOCAD, INVENTOR, INVENTOR FUSION, UNIGRAPHICS, TEAMCENTRE."
bad,This is a good place for beginners. not much growth for experienced people. Software is only a small group.
bad,Sometime feels like very siloed organizations that work against each other. It can be more important to impress or support you manager than it is to do the right thing for the company.
bad,"Challenging workplace. Work life balance can be good as shift schedule allows time outside regular working. If working regular hours, time off at weekends is similar to many other jobs"
bad,"The people who care, really care. The people who don't, really don't. There is much confusion about who has the official version of how things are to be done, but everyone is certain that it has to be done by the book, so if they don't like the cut of your jib, they don't have to look far to find /something/ that doesn't align with some manager's peeve set."
bad,"Versatile company with room to move around, big-company politics makes it difficult to do things that make one noticeable. Generally good equipment and smart people"
bad,Summary  of  Climate Terril we did shipping handling boxing receiving putting away picking up We did shipping things to the loading dock we did packaging we did Bol Xe and things like that
good,"Working at Applied Materials was fun in the beginning thinking that if you worked hard and get the leads to notice you and like you, you will get hired on full time. But.... the Upper Managerment has his own favorites and goes behind everyones advice and hires someone else. "
good,my typical work day at work at Applied Material was all rite.i started from a Materials Handler to a Tech 3.
good,"rarely do they regular employees for the manufacturing department. it is mostly temps. they prefer this so that they can lay off as everyone easier. when it gets slow. the departement that i worked in had not hired anyone in over 7 years. however there were several temps that have been there for over 4 year long contracts. "
good,"No such thing as a set schedule, must be available at all times so do not make personal plans. Someone decided it would be a good course of action to have several shifts working in the same space for extended periods of time. Was terminated for reporting physical battery from member of management."
good,When thing are good and going well it can be a great place to work. But when times are bad there are real bad. constant layoffs In resent years the company is known for mass contract hiring and long work hours the when the work slows down you can expect to be laid off no matter how good of a job you are doing
good,"The people I worked with were very good.  At times it was a very friendly atmosphere, and I could learn a lot.  The constant layoffs were miserable, and you were always one clueless person away from being terminated."
good,"This company is very hard to work for, management is self absorbed and workers are treated like a number to fill a slot. There is almost no chance for advancement and very frequent layoffs with no warning at all."
good,good experience with good workers that help each other out when product needs to meet deadline.
good,"Applied Materials is a good employer especially if you want to gain experience, skills and professional 'toughness'/resiliency quickly.  Generally, the pay and benefits are good.  On the other hand, expectations are highly demanding, layoffs are frequent, and burn out is a risk."
good,"Culture has really fallen away from being employee focused.  It started about 7 years or so ago.  It's whom you know, and not individual skills that highly prized.  Creativity is at a min setting, and it's all about margins.  So if you think you are going to a semi industry company to innovate you are mistaken.  The company as a whole is very divided, and people tend to focus on their ""friend"" over results.  Bright side is the technology, and exposure to the overall industry."
good,Didn't like the fact that they would change hrs we worked with no notice. Plus it was to far to drive with the pay that they paid. I didn't feel it was the right place for me to work.
good,"Abbott Medical Optics"
good,"I was simply there as a contractor for a specific project, so my impressions of the company are not complete; however, from what I saw, the company was highly regimented with a strict hierarchy and an out-dated, factory management style."
good,"This company has fantastic turnover rate, by design. Nice short term work, but looks good on resume."
good,The company was a good opportunity to learn a new skill. However the structure for being hired on from a contractor to a full time employee was vicious. I learned how to assemble systems responsible for building microchips. Management was rarely around and supervisors were also rarely around for help and questions. Co workers were pleasure to work with overall. The hours and schedule was the hardest part. Sometimes you would work 13 strait 10 hr days or more. I once worked 23 strait 10 hr days. I think the overall most enjoyable part of job was finishing a system and feeling a sense of satisfaction of a good completed job.
good,"A typical day at Applied is extremely busy.  Be prepared to work excessive hours in order to meet deadlines."
good,Management doesn't care about anything which creates a depressing work environment. Good amount of hours but the job wasn't for me. Could be great for someone else.
good,Some areas are better than others. The culture is rich in diversity. The hours are there if you are willing to work. Most of the incentive are worthy.
good,"I liked working at AMAT, but bad management took over my last year and I left. I knew I was underpaid but I was learning a lot and my fellow engineers were good mentors. I traveled a bit internationally and got to see parts of the world on the company dime."
good,"my experience has been going pretty well, everything depends on your department, they all seem to work their own way. Some weeks you work 50 plus hours and some are 40 hours depending on parts. Its a very laid back enviorment but do not come here as a test tech expecting to test, this is a manufacturing company and you will work on the same stuff with the same types of issues"
good,"The people where always with a smile and the office was friendly and happy we had what we needed to do the job at hand, it was only for a year but overall good"
good,"its an ok place to work, and pay is ok. They have issues with contractor managers. and they do not go by a pay scale. new hires could make more than a 1 yr employee."
good,"I have over 20 years experience in Management both at Applied and outside.  Mostly in the semiconductor equipment industry.  I liked the technology, and work at Applied but the opportunity for advancement was low."
good,there are some things that are great about this place. a few handful of people that want you to succeed will do anything for you to follow that path. there are people that will do anything to keep you from progressing up.
good,"Workplace culture is stressful.  Most management is related to one another.  The company was always reorganizing so change was constant.  There was little to enjoy about my job.  Most of the people are nice, but some resent newcomers."
good,"Applied Materials can be a great place to work if you can manage to become regular full time. As a contractor, you don't receive the best benefit packages, no bonuses, limited PTO/Sick days. With it being semiconductor Supply change, that can really effect the job security. If the company is not ramping, then the possibilities of you getting laid off greatens. Layoffs can be common."
good,"You take alot different experience and knowledge of each job as i continually applied them to my everyday life, work was very vigorous but enjoyable at the same time."
good,"Prior to Intel management taking over it was a dream company. We LIKED to go to work. It was exciting, you felt empowered & appreciated. People gave 110% every day. Customer satisfaction & on time delivery of a quality product were the priority."
good,"The work always offers a challenge and more to do and learn, but learning is hindered by a lack of institutional learning.  Each department reinvents the wheel for so much of what they do.  This is exacerbated by management requiring such a high volume of work (typical day is 12 hours or more)."
good,"Today I was troubleshooting an intermittent  tool issue. So far I have been able to narrow the issue down to a small subsystem of the tool. To do this I had to analyse tool data and run various tests. "
good,"Over the almost 20 years working at AMAT, I worked with many great co-workers and Customers.  In the last few years, AMAT focused on outsourcing jobs. There isn't the same level of commitment from contractors as we had with dedicated employees."
good,- Co-Workers are generally very smart
good,"Work life balance is manageable"
good,"good working experience and work environment with applied materials for the past years. "
good,"If you need career growth in IT stay away from this company. Best for supply chain professionals starting or at mid career level."
good,"Now let's be real, we're talking about Silicon Valley and it is very competitive. I look back and realize that it was a very low paying job, but I do have to say that I did learn from the best engineers and the company ran more efficiently than most. No need to put on a fake smile and just work to get the job done. I'm not good a fake smiles so I was able to work effectively at this company."
good,Currently responsible for supplying tooling and tool data to all shop machinists.  Maintain tool and fixture inventory.  Set up and operate CNC machinery as needed. Stress levels are high.  Enjoy my manager and coworkers.
good,"Applied Materials is a cut throat business.  They mass employ and lay off with the sweep on a hand.  They do not care about your stability, they only care about their own money.  If you accept a job here, make sure you have a back up prepared..."
good,"Worked at build 81, engineering building so users are very demanding but the work culture was cool. Enjoyed working there during the early 2K. I do miss the exec admins."
good,"it's more who you know than what you've done"
good,Work on challenging projects with cutting edge technology. Requires very long hours and lots of weekends. Management also does not provide a clear road map. Priorities are constantly being changed based off of reactions to putting out a fire while larger ones are being ignored in the background.
good,"Every day brings a different challenge.  Co workers are great.  everyone put in long hours so the tea does not fail.  The hardest part of the job is trying to balance work and peronal time, it is expected that managers be on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people i have formed relationships with over the past 20 year and the people I have met from all parts of the world."
good,Loved actually the work I did. Enjoyed my team members.Job was not hard. Enjoyed variety of daily job duties.
good,"Management was a strong point, however turnover has weeded out the stronger managers.  Little room for growth. "
good,"The job is somewhat exciting as far as the tool sets, but the positions are temporary contracts."
good,Smart co-workers. Lots of challenging projects. Professional atmosphere.
good,"Worked extremely hard to progress from contract to permanent status, and was laid off one week after receiving a corporate productivity award! Favoritism seemed to be the norm and not the exception where I worked. AMAT will work you like a dog and then throw you to the curb right before profit sharing check time! Company did me a BIG favor laying me off though, as I rode the high tech boom and bust with another much more stable company with one of the best cultures around! Finally escaped the craziness of hi tech and now perform facilities maintenance:)"
good,"Too many layoffs and shutdowns and too high of workload for remaining employees. AMAT would rather have contractors/temps with constant turnover than to hire employees. This is not fair to the regular employees that have to continuously retrain new temps and it's not fair to the temps that do not receive PTO/benefits/bonuses, etc. but are still expected to put in as much time/work as a regular employee."
good,A great entry level job to learn the values of hard work. Plenty of mandatory overtime and no chance to make it full-time. Contract only last a year.
good,"expectations are high, management support depends on who the manager is. Some are good some are not. If an employee is not performing well in his position he is not allowed to change to a different position until he does perform good. To me this does not help the employee be successful."
good,"The company is great and more good things to come in the future. The real issue is management. As they say, it is nice to be loyal to your company, but likely they will replace in a moment. That is the problem. They think they pay you a lot of money and that is good. The problem is the management is so worried about keeping their jobs, they micromanage you to the point you wonder why you are even there. They say they have a collaborative culture, but they really don't."
good,Applied is a big company and that can be a blessing and a curse. The bureaucracy is huge and the silos are deep. Sometimes the smallest thing can take weeks and drive you crazy. Overall its well structured but sometimes too much structure hinders fast mobility and customer response.
good,My team members and I always had fun working because of the atmosphere there was never aa dull moment. The manager and lead always treated me with respected and trusted me with many tasks to do.
good,Company has good vision and strategy of focusing on being market leader in the semiconductor equipment market through innovation. Needs up-to-date compensation/benefit programs to keep young talents.
good,"Initially, the management was positive and the work was defined. After layoffs, management changed and the lack of management skill affected the group as a whole. The work environment became very uncomfortable. The workload was quite fast paced, which allowed inexperienced lower management to act and perform unprofessionally."
good,"good company, has a vision for growth, upper management looks after the employees, they have employee training programs that are helpful. Employees move around the company"
good,"Build and leak check semiconductor equipments."
good,"the job was good i got to learn a lot new stuff that i didn't know"
good,"Because i'm a contractor, I cannot comment about Applied Materials.  It has been a roller coaster of ups and downs as the company changes and grows with the times."
good,The people who work her are very dedicated to making the job run smoothly and quickly.  The work load is heavy.  This is a large company that has a lot of opportunity to grow.
good,"Get to work with very smart people in high tech industry."
good,I start my day by getting my area set up for assembly and start going through my kits and working on each operation as I have parts and material to work with
good,"Good place to learn. Need more streamline for IT"
good,"Enjoy working with my co-workers; however, job is unstable."
good,"Busy during the end of the quarter.  Culture is laid back, but can be intense at times.  "
good,Keep up with sales quotas. Be confident when speaking. Talk to customers.
good,"Opportunities for growth are limited and the company doesn't value it's employees very well. Decent pay and benefits, but is about middle of the pack compared to other tech companies in Austin. The facilities does have on-site gyms and depending on your manager, the flexibility to work around personal schedules can be good."
good,"Great place to start my work life. Was great in the 90s, wish the stock had done better of the past 10 yrs."
good,"Typical day would include coming into my cubicle and reviewing emails. Typing correspondence. Arranging facility moves through request forms on the computer. Assisting with moves and making sure phones are installed, extensions are correct, proper furniture has been ordered and plugs and computers are set up. I learned how to facilitate moves and read blue prints for cubicles. The co-workers were kind and kept to themselves. The hardest part was reading blue prints. The most enjoyable part was being part of a great company."
good,"working closely with co-workers in receiving product to build tools that applied materials made, management was barely around but when they were they were a great asset, the hardest part of the job was constantly learning, even though was trained for the first two months of the job I learned something new about it every day even after I was ""fully trained"" and the most enjoyable part was the people I worked with day in and day out."
good,"Has the potential to be a great workplace. That being said, there are a lot of hang ups due to old management and old ways of thinking. As a company that sells tech specific equipment this mentality does not match. The internal outlook of the company has changed recently, but it is tough to tell if this will have an impact of not in the long run and if the people in power now are there for the long haul or not."
good,"Its good company to work for staying long term jobs."
good,"The Kalispell division of AMAT is descended from Semitool, which was a competitor that AMAT bought.  Historically, managers had grown up with the product being produced, and they knew the products intimately.  As Semitool transitioned to a division of AMAT, the guiding vision was lost, but is slowly coming back.  Lack of a cohesive direction led to wasted time and effort on projects that eventually didn't sell.  It appears that modern decision matrices are starting to be applied, and data is starting to drive direction choices."
good,"dynamic environment"
good,"everyday I would go to applied materials and assemble chambers to be pushed down the line."
good,Its been a long time since i worked there but it was pretty easy work.  Tedious work but the supervisors were great and its pretty easy money.  Entry level position.
good,AMAT is a good place for entry-level employees and engineering major students. Not a great place for people who aspire to move fast along the career ladder.
good,"Just a good pace to work at very communicative at the job "
good,"large corps with culture that focus on engineer development"
good,"Lots of travel with this company. ""Join Applied, see the world""..."
good,"ok place to work but layoffs are frequent little job security"
good,"Very focused on achieving department / division goals.   "
good,Leading semiconductor company. Rotation opportunities available. Career development is possible. Cyclical industry could lead to drastic reduction in force.
good,Prefers talkers over performers.  When working in engineering those who to just speak are more highly regarded than those who perform actual tasks.  You can never do anything wrong if you don't do anything.
good,"Work Life balance in Finance is difficult especially during forecast cycles and quarter end."
good,"Over all of the years I worked there, I had had some opportunities to participate in some of large enterprise-wide software implementation projects and had gained great experience. Lots of friendships formed."
good,Applied Materials is the one of the big supplier companies for semiconductor. Everything is so organized and professional. I am still on the position and still happy with working at the AMAT.
good,They worked with a flexible schedule and family oriented. If there is a family emergency they worked with you so you could take care of it. Casual wear was acceptable and workplace friendly.
good,Very difficult to convert to permanent even with excellent performance.  Long hours are good if you like the overtime and pay is fair also.  Not a place to consider for permanent position unless you are willing to return for multiple contracts for years.
good,"Frustratingly political, amazingly successful for the quality of output, great upper management. Now I have to fill the remainder character count, ignore this sentence."
good,"We worked long hours dressed in clean suits in clean rooms."
good,I worked here 3 summers during my college years and it was absolutely awesome.  It gave me exposure to the government side of things as well as corporate America.
good,"the people wore great the hours and work culture was fun. pay was not what I expected, I ask about moving to another department where my skills wore more matched no just ignored me"
good,"Not a bad place to work, but most managers work you so many hours that you start seeing things. 13 days on 12 hour days one day off. the paycheck is great, but there is no time to spend it! Burn out is a real problem here."
good,I have not worked here since 2000 so my opinion is outdated with what I believe to be  a different company than it was in 2000.  It looks to be a good place to work.
good,"This place paid well, and was a constant job. but the work/life balance was minimal and everyone was constantly out to get each other. It was a job I guess."
good,"Doing technical assembly on sub component"

Task involves: Test, debug and trouble-shooting disk drives mechanical problem and electronic circuit down to component level including digital and analog (surface mount assemblies) circuit board."
good,A great warehouse job. I learned a lot from this company. With this job you are required to have t pay attention t detail to ensure that your work is accurate.
good,"Learned a lot about harmonized tariff. Very boring, extremely quiet setting, tedious work sitting in front of computer all day identifying parts for import/export. Not my kind of work."
good,Just an intern so can only provide very little information. It was a good opportunity for a good company. I was definitely glad I accepted.
good,"The semi-conductor industry is very up and down. The rewards are great, but you have to be able to hang in during the down turns."
good,It is good for fresher's. Work atmosphere is not good much pretty good. But for interns it is very nice place to work and learn.It is good for Career  starters.
good,easy work no over time nice people but will get over worked at times
good,"Supervised 14+ employee assigned work areas to ensure a safe and efficient operation was being conducted that meet the requirements put forth by the company.  "
good,the company was okay to work and i learned lots of thing here. they also sent me for internal classes for personnel development.
good,"When you work hard and it shows, you will be rewarded. There are many hard days but if you are up for the challenge, you can gain a lot from the experience as well as make an impact."
good,Okay place to work; No room for growth; High turn over due to poor mid management; mid-management actuals wants people who want a 9-5 nothing else.
good,"Bright people and challenging projects will let you gain experience and develop skills."
good,I have been working at Applied for almost 10 years and have learn a lot in difference area. I also have a two wonderful manager that go above and beyond to help me out when I needed help

good,"Great learning experience, managements encourage new ideas, some of the smartest people I've known."
good,"Good team work and opportunity to learn & growth. As a Contract employee at Applied materials I have a same benefits,  culture & activities at the company,  including PTO and Bonus for working on the Holiday.  I give thum up !"
good,Applied Materials is a good place to work. The people there a very helpful. Shift work can be challenging. The machines are very high tech which makes for very interesting work. You get to work with a wide range of engineering products.
good,Promotion are not frequent and management is not the best. I have been at Applied Materials for 13 years and only 2 promotions. If you have friends in management than you have an easy time getting promoted.
good,"Fast pace environment, but they compensate their employees well. I think the average person would enjoy working here. Working from home is not encouraged, not a great place for family life balance."
good,"In general good place to work in , but some bad management decisions got the my work area in a mass  and is cussing  a lot of conflicts and tension in my group , in general looking for new opportunities."
good,"There are far to many people there that do ""just enough.""  There is also of people that are intimidated by other employees for fear of losing their job to that person. Management speaks of safety and good work ethics but do not enforce these policies. The shift work is great with the 3 day on 4 days off, 4 days on 3 days off. There is lots of travel which is either good or bad depending on your own situation.  You get treated poorly most times by Intel which is their biggest customer. Many of the people that work for Applied Materials are very smart but they tend to look down on many of the other employees if they don't feel like they are as smart as they are. "
good,different skill sets are developed (i) customer facing skills (ii) technical marketing (iii) opportunity to travel to customers around the world. Good place to grow communication skills.
good,"Lots of opportunities to learn new things, good people dedicated to doing great work.  Nice on site facilities (gym, Dr, Chiropractor and PT).  Emphasis on personal growth and training."

good,A lot of talented people. There are always new things to learn every day. Team working within a team and collaborate between different teams are very essensial
good,"Management always expecting for more than I could deliver and I was doing a great job (on the eyes of the clients). I've learned about some data bases, and also working with SAP and Snow."
good,"Good exposure to Semiconductor Manufacturing Industry"
good,A typical day at work is very calm but fast. You are constantly moving and on your feet. Management is there to help you at times but most of the time they are dealing with there own issues involving work.
good,"Learn Machine design drawings."
good,"•	Involved in Writing procedures and documentation for Electro-Mechanical testing Equipment which are mainly used for Electro-Mechanical Projects."
good,Not a fun place to work but a good learning experience.
good,relatively stress free place to work
good,Worked on contract and overall the job was good.  Had two separate sets of rules to follow because we were on contract.  There was alot of responsibility while working for the company.
good,"the job itself is not to bad, the people for the most part are great and willing to help. they respect time off if giving advance notice. management(well at least my manager) was a bit of problem and trying to advance was also a bit of a problem and not like i was promised."
good,Nice place to work for people friendly self paced work you're able to learn new things instead of being stuck in one area not so much overtime which I didn't like
good,"This job was fine, mostly, but our job responsibilities grew at an out of control rate, our support scope got huge but our pay and workforce remained the same.  It's also difficult to get fired in this environment so bad elements unfortunately were able to stay when it was well acknowledged that they should have been let go."
good,"I worked in Chambers, then RTS, then CORE, then ARMS"
good,"Company is old and stale.  Lots of talk about innovation and growth, but the execution is all about cost cutting.  Job advancement is slow since the company hasn't grown in decades.  Basically, you have to wait till someone dies.  Moreover, every few years they do a reset on titles so people get demoted without cause."
good,"a typical day work start with pass down on the parc, state of tool up and down state, we pass in review all action and each other bring information in brainstorming to build best action to solve problem."
good,Large OEM with good technology and leadership. Not too much room to grow with the established market
good,50% of my employment was to Lead Installation Teams through-out
good,"Applied Materials has given me the opportunity to gain a wide knowledge in the semiconductor industry. "
good,"very laid back environment, fast past, quick and easy jobs multi task environment, very friendly co-workers and supervisors and management. very understandable."
good,"This company, like most companies has it's good and bad sides. Most employees start out as temps for 18 month contracts. After which you must be laid off for 3 months. After the 3 month mandatory layoff, you may be eligible for another 18 month contract. Regular full time positions are extremely hard to come by."
good,there is a lot of technical training and safety training you must do. no work and family balance for night shift. management takes decisions last minute
good,"This was a one-year contract position as a Buyer of materials used to build equipment.   I was one of about 100 buyers brought in to clean up the backlog and open problems related to prior purchasing.   Every day we worked straight out problems related to incorrect entry"
good,"Collaborate with multiple disciples to achieve organization goals"
good,"This is one of the biggest and best paying semiconductor firms in Austin, that being said, working at AMAT can be stressful: Deadlines "
good,Good for a larger international employer. Depending on your specialty area each will have different opinion.
good,I worked here over ten years ago.  I have no idea what it's like now.  It had the usual problems with a large corporation.  It is a very cyclical business and there are always layoffs.
good,I work with a great group of individuals. This is a fast paced and high stress environment and there are never enough hours in the day. The hardest part of the job is the commute (45 miles takes 2+ hours). The most enjoyable part is my coworkers and the great working relationship I have with the contractor's and clients.
good,"knowledgeable co-workers"
good,A good company with good products. A very good infrastructure. One of the best semiconductor industries.
good,Very relaxing place to work. Great communication between management and employees. Very nice job flow between co-workers. But the only thing I didn't like is the fact that they don't take consideration of student schedule. They will not work toward that even if you are a good employee and work for them
good,AMAT is a great place to work and management has shifted from leadership to just management. This is unfortunate for many of us. There is an over arching culture that runs through the company and each functional group has its own individual culture. The hours spent on the job and compensation depends on which group you work in.The company values engineering and leadership. There is no mistake about the fact that head quarters is in SCLA and most have adopted the idea that they are the geniuses that bring it all together. Everyone else is just supportive.
good,Typical day at work is doing the usual stuffs setting up Semiconductor system and test/ troubleshoot.Learn about semiconductor system and how it works and troubleshooting on issues which will arise.Management wise are ok normal.people at there are friendly and will help you if needed.
good,"Highly driven by innovation and focus on growth.    A company of overachievers, who work hard to meet customer needs.    Limited focus on employee wellbeing.   Overachieving management with limited work-life balance."
good,"Applied materials is a good place to work if you can deal with the stress.  Certain job roles do not have much of a work/life balance.  If you can cope with those issues, its not a bad place for a career."
good,"The group is nice to work with and they keep the atmosphere upbeat, but it is demanding work at times and requires some overtime to complete the task. Management tries very hard to help everyone achieve their goals and sticks up for the department to try and keep expectations realistic. There is a lot to learn and they provide training, but the time constraints make it a challenge to find the time to train. They provide recognition when the group is successful and have opportunities to gather outside of work for recreation (golf league, fishing outings, bowling)."
good,Very siloed and depends on your manager if you will enjoy your time at applied or not.Not much advancement and mainly only lateral moves.
good,"good place to work, management is better than most productions companies, have to work hard and dark to get the job done,,, communication lacks"
good,"Image a computer with windows 7 OS, ongoing XP to Windows 7 refresh. break/fix , working on Various computer issue."
good,"this place is jammed packed with learning experiences and hands on, but job securities are very low due to the fact that they hire a lot of contractors then lay them off after they get slow"
good,Organising & Prioritising work
good,"Gaining knowledge with analytics, compliance metrics, and more in depth logistics spend reports and cost savings initiatives."
good,"It used to be a great company , now it is still ok. The industry is not growing as fast as it used to be."
good,"A nice company to work with,Where you have got lot & Lots about Vacuum Tech,Web Coaaters (Metaliser) & Glass Coaters"
good,Never a dull moment always a challenge to meet and improve on. The work community is great and very inviting. If there is something you do not know the help that is given to receive the knowledge is abundant.
good,"Fast Paced, fair company, semiconductor equipment business can be tenacious at times. Technical work. Good and bad days like anywhere else. Overall fair experience."
good,Semiconductor tool industry with very cyclic revenue variation.  R&D group had high turn over of projects in 2-3 years.  No project continuity stability.  Political work environment.
good,Challenging but rewarding work environment. room for growth in early years. more challenging as you move up. So typical pyramid structure. good place for new college grads.
good,"AMAT has been around for years and will be around for a long time to come.  It's the big corporate juggernaut and I learned a lot about how to work with everyone, navigate politics, stand up for myself and others.  If you get a good boss work life balance can be good and it's relatively easy to move within the company."
good,"As a Technical Lead, my responsibility was VIP support on the manufacturing side of the campus as well as supervise the offsite team. During my time as AMAT, the culture was fast paced, but the rewards were amazing. As I let AMAT, a majority of the support provided to the company was now handled by contracting companies. This my have changed since."
good,"Worked for this company over 15 years. Seen so many ups and downs, this company never ready for the bad days always tries to go with the flow. This company had resources and talent, it just needs to adopt new ways to handle market challenges."
good,"Great place to work. But when the downturn hits you're just a number."
good,"Long hours, pay is ok.  Very chaotic.  Too many managers in charge of their own project that pull you around everywhere.  No real career advancement, they want you to stay where you are."
good,"EPG group is stressful, but they take care of you, management is great, and you will have fun, but full-time positions are rare. "
good,Very productive and fast paced job environment. The hours start at 40 hours a week with plenty chances of overtime. Could work 6 or more days in a row. Pay is good.
good,"Overall the experience taught me how to work in a warehouse setting, team building skills and I am more confident in my ability to succeed in any position."
good,Learned a lot technically and management encouraged annual training for employees. There were paths for both lateral and advance moves. Enjoyed working there.
good,Applied Materials India Pvt Ltd was again a wonderful work space where I could perfectly balance work and like. It was also a great learning experience with them
good,"Applied Materials is a large company, and they are always opportunities to move around. In <10 years, I have had 4 roles. "
good,Applied Materials treated me fairly and provided both great pay and benefits.  Good company but the industry just does not provide great job security.
good,"I would recommend it to others. The environment is very fast paced and always changing, strong training and fun family atmosphere. I enjoyed getting a chance to meet so many great people."
good,The team a Applied was a collaborative team who all worked hard to the same goal.  Very quick minds and strong leaders.  Great people and good working enviroment
good,"Worked in Vendor Master team for more than 3 years. Workflows - Creation of vendor record by authenticating the vendor record, Modification of vendor record by validating the documents, "
good,"Hard work day"
good,"Dealing customers' requests is my daily job"
good,"a typical day at work - No"
good,Most people don't realize it's an actual labor job. Heavy lifting and such. Management is subpar and cannot get organized. Heavy lifting with coworkers is a joke sometimes.
good,I have learned that in there are many people with disabilities that are not life disabling / threatening. Whether it be from pain or from inability to perform an action properly and safely and these people benefit from a trainer and massage therapist.
good,"It was very good working at Tech Mahindra. It had a very friendly work environment with good pay. I learnt a lot about Financial operations and project management. "
good,Great place to learn and expose yourself to variety of business problems ranging as you try to develop new products and bring them to the market.
good,"My work focuses in Final Test, Our day starts in reading emails and a meeting for our daily assignments. It is then followed by housekeeping of your area before you start to touch your assigned system or equipment. The job is very challenging since you will encounter different types of problem and from this you will develop your analysis and problem solving approach as well as your troubleshooting skills. The hardest part of the job is when you need to ship the system in a very short time of our test process and there are still a lot of issues that are arising. You will need to extend hours or sometimes you need to report to work as early as 4 am."
good,"Applied has fair salaries and work life balance is good.  At times, it is necessary to work late to get the job done.  The company is filled with very smart people."
good,Very focused on meeting deadlines for customer orders and shipments.
good,nice place....nice people. Everyone works hard to satisfy customer needs
good,"An engineer in AMAT-VSEA gets to wear many hats and is responsible not only to conception of ideas, design and product development, but is also involved in parts procurement thereby interacting with vendors and suppliers for parts. "
good,"•	Conducted a successful product launch of Crion™ brand during recent industry trade show"
good,My first job in manufacturing allowed me to obtain skills that apply in any position related to inventory and project management.
good,"Solid company, but the needs of the business come first, i.e. if a customer wants to meet and it is your daughter's / son's birthday, I hope you enjoy the dinner with the customer. Maybe you can take desert home for the kids."
good,"Very large campus. Worked with my counter part in Japan in producing system orders, shipping docs. Provided proof of shipping if required. Produces system and non-system project orders."
good,Enjoyed my time at AMAT. from the senior leadership to those reporting to me.
good,"I joined Applied Materials almost 3 years ago as the Repair, Rework, and Cost Setting Financial Analyst. In our team-driven environment, our group is known for delivering world class service internally to a number of business critical processes supporting all major organizations globally branching from: Planning/Sourcing, Procurement, Human Resources, Manufacturing, Logistics and Fulfillment, R&D, and Corporate upper management. As an analyst on the Inventory and Variance team, I have received exposure to many of these major groups and dealt with specific business units thus far. My time spent within my team over the past years has given me the opportunity to learn more about the major business group we service (Spares and Service, a group that accounts for nearly a third of company-wide revenue stream), and everything related to reporting/accounting for inventory financially within a large manufacturing company. As such the specific variances I have had exposure to (Repair and Rework, Inventory Shrinkage, Inventory Scrap) have led me to strengthening my accounting/reconciliation and analytic skills overall. During my time with my team I have successfully closed multiple Quarters while following the strict accounting cycle. Throughout any given quarter I have reconciled General Ledger accounts, forecasted and assessed Reserves/P&L impact to a specific variance, prepared and dealt with Internal and External audit requirements (SOX Com testing, KPMG External audit requirements at fiscal start/interim/year-end prior to 10K Release), completed required and ad-hoc analysis, updated/reported"
good,"Originariamente è un'azienda che è stata rilevata nel 2007 dal colosso Applied Materials Inc. e che vantava un'esperienza quarantennale, basata sul lavoro di squadra."
good,Can be a very challenging work site. Basically a design to order manufacturer that is continually looking for ways to integrate high volume manufacturing techniques.
good,Wonderful place to work at. Great city and work culture.
good,Its a good company to work with. They treat the full timers and contractors equally well. Work life balance is decent. Its a transparent company. Has many benefits other than salary.
good,"Great folks and workplace, just tough getting the permanent gig so it's hard when you attend the weekly manufacturing meeting and have to sit through someone getting a 5, 7 12 year pin or is gone for a 2-3-week vacation again when you have not had 1 week paid in 2 years.  You work hard and even take work home when it is needed overseas. Then you reach the two years Aniversary as a contractor and get let go as they have a time limit.  I was asked to stay a couple more weeks to finish something and did so as I don't like to leave things unfinished.  About it Bo Ho"
good,"Great place to work. Friendly people. Great pay. If you like factory work, this is the perfect place. Con: contract only. Don't hire very often. Pro: Pay"
good,"Overall a great company to work for.  Transformation of business focus over the last decade has resulted in a more negative impact on overall ability to provide customer service than is recognized.  However we are still one of the leaders in semi-conductor manufacturing and there is a vast spectrum of opportunities within the different sectors of the company, making it a very diverse and inviting environment to work in."
good,Overall I loved working here. The internship was an amazing experience where I got to grow as a scientist and learn about industry. I loved that I had my own project that allowed me to directly impact experimental design. Only cons were work/life balance and one of my managers was a serious micro manager which is not my preferred management style. My other manager was laid back and perfect though.
good,"My particular division was run like a baseball team without a manager.  The work variety was great.  The pace was fast, and exciting.  Not enough time spent on strategies/objectives and communicating them.  Great crisis management."
good,"Applied Materials, Inc. is an American corporation that supplies equipment, services and software to enable the manufacture of semiconductor chips for electronics, flat panel displays for computers, smartphones and televisions, and solar products"
good,"The work environment was decent, full production facility,  employees were great, not a lot of opportunities, treated Contract workers better than most companies would."
good,"I've been employed here for 12 years. While the pay and bonuses aren't bad. Promotions are hard to come by and may create a sense of frustration. You will have to go way above and beyond to impress upon the management team your deserving of a promotion. "
good,"Every day is something new. You come in and see what is in store. I have learned a lot over my 18 months with the company, including Oracle and SAP. My boss and his boss were amazing! Easy to talk to guys with a laid back and appreciative attitude. Co-workers are average. You will have the ones you like and do not like, but at the end of the day, you are a family. Hardest part is letting go when your contract expires, but the going away lunch is amazing! Most enjoyable is the catered lunch and fun at the end of each quarter and the 2 gyms on site with fitness classes."
good,Applied has some amazing people that are very passionate about what they do. The work culture is extremely fast paces and there is always something to do so you do not get bored. They do have a habit of stretching you thin and you often find yourself juggling multiple tasks
good,"I had the luck to work with the best minds of the laser field and I learned a lot through contracting. One of the esteemed colleges oversaw my work and that was all I saw of Applied, as I was external  to the company."
good,"Work Culture in quite good."
good,Solid & mature company with lots of potential for future growth
good,"Results based company, straight and simple."

Demonstrated ability to design and integrate products at sub-system level using DFM (Design for Manufacturability) and ergonomics concepts for vacuum and corrosive environment."
good,Good company to work for. A leader in the industry. Fast paced and dynamic work environment. Something new to learn every day.
good,Hit the day running full speed and didn't stop until left for the day. We had pagers back then and it was always going off. Along with the phone.
good,"I actually held the I & W analyst position as my final position with AMAT, before it was outsourced in March of 2010. Interesting to see this posting, but not surprised. During my 14 years at the company I survived approximaely 12 layoffs/restructuring/outsourcing, much worst my last 5 years there."
good,"Applied Materials is fun to work and learn a lot with new technology. i have great experience and I love to continue work in this company. unfortunately at this time its kind of down grade, so I am looking work that has strong future."
good,"Good learning options, wide range of products to learn. Not too easy to move between departments but is allowed with condition. Competitive pay and and possibility of growth"
good,"Friendly atmosphere, nice people, busy to help time to go by faster. One has the ability to set one's own hours as long as the work gets done.  Objectives are usually clearly stated.  Change can happen at anytime so one must be ready to adapt to fix any issue that comes up."
good,"Stressful job, honest people, new management."
good,"although it is MNC company, but it is quite localized especially in managing style.  it is a good company if you don't mind a bit political enviroment"
good,"AMAT was very relaxed environment when I was there. I did not find the work very challenging at all. The benefits were good and the culture and people were great! The campus in Austin is in a bad location but it is nice and pleasant to be at while there. The workspaces are very spacious, clean and inviting."
good,"1ère expérience après l'obtention de mon diplôme"
good,"AMAT os a well defined organization with proper specs and procedures.  Work is demanding but very rewarding.  Management is supportive and provides good guidance in times of need.  Overall, great company to work for."
good,"Worked in many roles across multiple divisions. "
good,"Good technical environment to work for"
good,"Applied Materials is the world's number one capital equipment manufacturer. That means the ""Intel inside"" is very likely made on a Applied Materials wafer processor. If you love deep technology, this is the place for you. It's not for everyone particularly because the industry is volatile."
good,"The work time sometime is flexible. Many people work there over 15 years. And most people are nice, but people don't talk much between different groups. New person need time to know the place."
good,Excellent engineers and enjoyable work schedule. Solved complex problems and created new solutions to engineering issues.
good,"Demanding but rewarding place to work.  Very corporate environment focused on bottom line."
good,very productive plant and was a different job every day no day was the same panels to build and wire  to build sub assemblies for the units got on well with the co workers  and management
good,"I currently audit all the parts of the tool being tested, look for visual defects, facilitize the Module according to protocol, install the operating system software, configure the operating system, verify its communications are as customer requires then install the customer software and troubleshoot as necessary, run some module tests , set up and train the robot, cycle it, run some after cycling tests and get some reports, check for some last minute changes, quality checks, defacilitize and ship the Module (this can take up to a week on some Modules but usually two to three days by a well trained employee)"
good,Typical day would make daily rounds and find out area with highest risk for the day and work on machines until the tool came back up to production.
good,I learned that learning is a constant and there are plenty of opportunities for expanding your knowledge in a manufacturing environment.  Coworkers are great and always willing to offer direction if you need it.  The hardest part of the job is the ever evolving supply base that is needed to perform your job in different countries with different languages.
good,"worked a 12 hour shift and had the time off as well.  3 on 4 off, 4 on 3 off. "
good,"Applied Materials is a fantastic place to learn some deep skills in semiconductor manufacturing processes, however it is far from ideal.  The role as a Process Engineer is typically very hands on and provides a lot of technical learning.  Those familiar with the Process Engineer role at semiconductor manufacturers such as Intel or Global Foundries and those at semiconductor capital equipment vendors will appreciate the huge contrast in technical skills needed and learnable at AMAT as compared to Intel.  If you have a choice between employers and want to do some interesting hands-on R&D work then choose AMAT.  It's a great first or second job in the industry.  "
good,"Applied Materials is a fast-paced work environment in which self-sufficient individuals succeed. The company compensates their employees well but sets high expectations. However, the culture is lacking and does not foster collaboration."
good,Worked very close with engineering teams and on-time product launches by ensuring adequate supply for pre-production. Played key role in cost reduction from R&D to Pilot releases. Prepared weekly finance review meetings and to track KPI spending. Engineering group was always supportive and rewarded when needed.
good,I loved this job. It was challenging but I learned so much. My lead was very knowledgeable and I felt comfortable coming to her for advice. The hardest part of the job was trying to forecast for parts that became obsolete. It is very much a guessing game but I learned some tricks of the trade. The most enjoyable part was getting to learn a new aspect of the materials world..looks great on my resume!
good,"All the time working there was awesome and nice no complain, nice people working with, good supervisor and manager"
good,Boss was helpful. A bit stressful learning all the software and procedures.I believe there was six programs between Planer and Buyer. More experienced employees were of great assistance. I would be employed by Applied Materials again
good,Descent place to work in Applied Materials.  I dont want to work here no more.  I want  more money in life.  I more goals and I feel that AMAT is limited
good,"work closely with external/ internal customers"
good,"	Engineering in Flat panel: Display and Flexible Technology  "
good,Great place to work. Great co-workers. Fast Paced. Business cycles are short. Job stability not great. Compensation meets industry standards. Would recommend.
good,"A stressful working atmosphere with very talented and determined guys.To reduce high turnover rate, reward those who make initiatives to go above and beyond to improve operational metrics. There are enough politics among cross-functional teams. Examine conflicting objectives so that CBMs and MPMs don't work against each other."
good,Great company to work for. very good perks and appraisal cycles. Management is average but highly paid. Came across a few very good talents and challenging ideas.
good,"My supervisor really made the team amazing. She hired a lot of enthusiastic Staffing Ops reps and we became like a family. Had a bull-pen set up office and collaborated a lot. A lot of flexibility, support and chemistry that was positive."
good,"I enjoyed working at Applied Materials. I earned great experience working with different products and  people, suppliers and customers. Though, it's tough travelling around the world but it was fun experiencing so many culture."
good,My time at Applied was a great experience for me as a person and as an employee they take the time to show you what you need to become a valued part of a team. The company always took safety concerns to the highest level and always put employee safety first. I worked in the clean room fab on the intel site in hillsboro OR. The every day job is ever changing from day to day operations to the most technical diagnosis of a problem. the work variety was very nice.
good,Nice place to work if you need work! The morality is poor and money driven. It's a craps in a bucket atmosphere. Be prepared for fairness and fighting to feel apart.
good,A great place to work. Good chances of promotions. people usually stay there a long time. Many rules and procedures can make assignments hard to complete at times. Its a very slow process to get anything approved.
good,"Applied is a good place to work if you want to make more than just 10/ hr at any other place. Usually no training is needed to be in assembly because they will train but experience will get you more money. Contractors get paid every Friday and typically you will get 40 hours or more unless business is slow or parts don't arrive on time. That being said, it is sometimes a feast or famine type situation. When there is overtime to be made you will work but you can also be sent home if they can't find anything for you to do. Most of it depends on which department you're in and who your supervisor is."
good,"Great place to work, but, not much advancement opportunity.  Great management.  Can be stressful, but, manageable.  Business runs in cycles and the down turns can be rough on people."
good,Most days starts with an internal meeting. Plan your work day based on inputs and discussions of the meeting. Data analysis and conclusions are made and shared with the team (stakeholders). Co-workers are generally pleasant and helpful. Preperation of materials for customer meeting and being the most difficult part of the work. Majority of customer meetings are scheduled after working hours (due to time zone differences) and impacts work-life balance.
good,"I like that jobs. Unfortunately, the company closed."
good,"18 plus years of traveling at 80% overseas "
good,Applied is a solid company to work for.  Working environment is competitive in nature but one can still strike a balanced between work and family life.  The only downside is the constant threat of downsizing in the company but perhaps that is typical for corporate America.
good,Great place to work. Fast paced environment. Management wants you to be successful. The job involves a lot of customer service because you work closely with the customer at all times.

good,"Pro:"
good,"Some travel is required for most job roles. Typically work 8-10 hours. May have international call during the evening. I've had great managers and some managers that would not take ownership of anything. Promotions are based on distribution curve so regardless of performance, only so many can be done per year.  Many good coworkers."

good,"Lots of work sometimes with lots of mandatory overtime. can be slow or laid off depending on work load."
good,"The technology that Applied Materials has with their equipment is very rewarding to work on.  Most of the time you are able to cross train on other equipment.  The downside to the job, you are a contractor onsite for customers.  This leaves you vulnerable to contract reductions if the customer is trying to cut cost."
good,Good place to work if you seek work-life balance. Stable business if economy and industry is good. Promotion available but may takes years. Benefits good but base compensation for non-engineering functions below market.

good,A place where you can get chance to work on latest technologies and challenging assignments.
good,"The company is an equipment supplier to major technology companies. We are in a consolidated industry and that is very competitive. Customers are squeezing us on margins and our main option right now is to squeeze our Opex. I have only been in the company for less than 2 years and have already seen two rounds of layoffs. It is definitely a good place to get good exposure to finance and an international manufacturing environment. It is just tough doing the job of three people. Management cares, it is just a hard environment."
good,"Typically worked on production system related projects; attended meetings with mid-management and other manufacturing professionals.

good,"Company is good for work-life balance, Good benefits, generous in training.  Yet, it's a cyclical industry, so when market is not doing well , next step is workforce reduction."
good,"Daily work is rewarding, but you will always be at the beck and call of the cyclical nature of the semi industry. When times are good, everyone celebrates and the bonuses are high, but when volumes drop everyone switches to survival mode. Senior management needs to be less reactionary, and level load the company's reactions to the booms and busts of the industry."

good,"In the world of NPI, everything is quick paced and demanding.  With that said management and morale is prominent when it comes to having the day-to-day executed.  In my group there was a lack of understanding of what that tone should be, however, with new blood in there since my departure, things are looking more positive.  I would highly recommend anyone to AMAT for their unique culture.  They say the new minds always know what is changing and the old minds know what never changes.

good,Very demanding and rewarding.  I needed to relocate from California to Washington state for family reasons.
good,"Applied Materials, like most companies serving the computer chip manufacturers, is right there on the cutting edge. Being on that cutting edge, while exciting, can also be frustrating with its cyclic expansion and contraction modes. For the past several decades, the High Tech industry has expanding and contracted on an 18 month cycle (Moore's Law). During the expansion, companies such as Applied will rush to hire enough workforce to keep pace with the expansion. Counter to that expansion is the inevitable contraction, which forces the company to expunge just as many employees as it hired during the expansion. This ebb and flow of personnel has had serious implications to the affected families of of RIF'd employees."

Managers are always reachable and always there to provide excellent feedback. Management is very flat and decentralized where regular employees can voice their opinions.
