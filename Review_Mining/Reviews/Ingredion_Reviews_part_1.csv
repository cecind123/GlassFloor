rating,review
bad,We never get paid on time. Management micromanages so much that they will never listen to what you have to say. Employees that have been there over 20 years management will never listen to them.
bad,"Despues de un mes de entrevista y luego de haber firmado contrato, haber hecho de todo en papeles y examen. 3 dias antes de comenzar me llamaron y me dijeron que habia salido un pequeño problema en los examenes en un oido. Algo super debil. Una ofensa. Desprecie varias opciones para trabajar y la compañia me quedo mal eso que firme casi dos semanas antes contrato. Creia que la compañia era mas responsable y tenia otros valores."
bad,Management treats employees as bodies in chairs.  I never interviewed with the manager just the temp service and was sent the following monday. Training is  mediocre at best.  Management is trying to put a shared services together but has no clue...maybe in 5 years it will be a okay place to work
bad,"Worked at ingredion for less than a year. There is a reason why this company.has a high turnover rate. The company prides itself on safety but in my time employed here I have seen a handful of people get hurt (minor incidents and close calls) and people have privately complained about safety concerns but yet these people are too scared to speak up, because the company boasts about 365+ days without an incident. Employees are scared to be 'the one' who breaks the streak.  The company boasts about safety yet the piping leaks the floors are wet from these leaks and the floors are slick and slippery from the sugar water and syrup coating the majority of the floor. Yet the company refuses to shut down to repair these issues because honestly the quantity of production outweighs the safety of the workers. If there is a fire alarm set off, the employees are responsible to locate and gather anyone in the facility (not management, or safety)  if there is a so2 or ammonia leak (put on a respirator and keep doing your job) ingredion claims safety but nothing I saw promotes that."
bad,"Es muy insegura la planta,han tenido muertes de personal por accidentes,el más actual el 21 de diciembre 2019 2 heridos y 1 fallecido. Recursos Humanos prepotentes."
bad,A Complete mismanaged and incompetent management driven place. They fully expect subservience. Very much a penny-pincher  attitude. Manager will throw you under the Bus every time.
bad,Awful company to work for. Run for the hills. I would not recommend them to anyone. The pay is far below the industry standard. Lack of education because they a cheap.
bad,Their corporate office is in the process of restructuring the whole organization so job security is non-existent.  Their own employees are having to reapply for their own jobs just to even be considered in the restructuring process.
bad,"No job security.  Upper Management says they value their employees, but that is not the case.  Employees are lied to, and even many successful years with the company mean nothing.  Company has no loyalty to hard-working employees."
bad,"I really don’t know how ingredion got up to four stars. This company is terrible, be expected to work forced 16 hour shifts and management only cares about numbers. Once the weekend hits they’re no where to be found. I’m surprised more people haven’t gotten hurt at this plant because they claim safety is #1 priority but it’s really not. STAY AWAY FROM INGREDION UNLESS YOU ARE TIER ONE PAY."
bad,"Despiden a los colaboradores por procesos de reestructura con un dia de anticipo, dejandolos de un dia a otro en la calle."
bad,"Work schedule 7 days a week with one weekend off a month, cut throat environment. Lots of forcing to cover absent worker, hourly workers most likely end up in divorce because you cannot be with your family.  If the weather gets bad, if the city cease public transportation, airport closes prepare yourself for a letter of warning or being suspended.  This place is not family oriented for hourly workers."
bad,"50/60 hours work weeks. okay benefits, Company is growing under their current leadership team. They need to consider work life balance. Great growth opportunity."
bad,"Ingredion is going through a lot, stock is still low and they were having some major operational issues. I would not recommend working here if you can help it."
bad,"The work is ok, management is oblivious to their responsibility to direct the work force. Union place, lots of back stabbers, lots of finger pointing, need really thick skin to work here."
bad,It was worst job I ever had a couple of front end staff ok rest of employees sucked hard work messy work hours suck only good this was the pay and benefits crappiest place ever to work
bad,Hateful towards blacks. And other indeginous people . . . You can’t just come to work and do your job. If you don’t befriend and butt kiss and look and act like the current employees. They’ll try their very best. With all ntentions to lie and make sure your through under the bus and fired. Especially if you don’t smile shuck and jive.
bad,"Supporting two Officers is too much work for one person.  Not open to change or process improvement.  No teamwork or support.  Not an environment in which employees can grow and learn,"
bad,"no hay crecimiento y lo que más valora la empresa es la antigüedad, no el desempeño."
bad,"Average work per week for salaried employees is 60 hours. Safety is not really a priority, but production rate is. Managers scream during performance review meetings."
bad,"I worked at Ingredion for 6 years and in the last 2 years, the company's culture took a nose dive.  Upper management were losing their jobs, which left no direction and utter chaos.  Company is downsizing to save /retain money.  Goals are profit oriented.  Workers are left to work very long hours with little reward.  Once I left, I didn't realize just how green the grass really is on the other side."
bad,shift work over time usually means another 8 hour shift lower end of pay scale for the type of work done chance for advancement internally is minimal some drama with co-workers
bad,If you enjoy having weekends off need not apply.  Management is lazy and unorganized which leads to the jobs being harder than necessary..  Cannot get the tools necessary to do the job.  Hours are long
bad,"As a wise coworker once put it to me, this place is good for a job, not for a career. While it is a good stepping stone for a young engineer, or for someone who likes to keep their head down and follow the pack, you'll be left wanting if you're looking for significant opportunities to lead change or take calculated risks."
bad,Good first step into working world. Currently based on two tier system so if you're a new hire you will be getting lower pay rate. Union job that is pretty solid.
bad,"Es una buena empresa a nivel nacional, trabaje muy poco tiempo."
bad,Great benefits great job for a starter job for an invdivdual who is starting a out. Can be a very dirty and physical job. Continuous management changes.
bad,"Decent employer, no work/life balance.  I would not recommended this employer to any family or friends.  Salary is decent, however employees are expected to provide afterhours support without compensation."
bad,"Good work/life balance, and mostly nice people. The higher up the food-chain you go, the pettier people tend to get. Management is awful. Tries to innovate, yet lacks innovation."
bad,"Good to start career. Competitive benefits. Significant turnaround of employees at the professional level. New talent leave the company, while old timers stay."
bad,When working with this company you need to know that you will be working in the office and from home. They want you to work more than they tell you when interviewing. It's a good company but don't always meet the needs of the employees. Working for this company gave me a good feeling. Most Managers in the company are great to work with and will work with you on problems.
bad,"The buck is often passed and the little man always takes the fault."
bad,"I was able to develop new work skills that include, forklift skills and warehouse skills. I also got promoted to process operator. Worked long shifts."
bad,Learned alot. Met some great people. Operations is rotating shift work.
bad,"The only reason this company got such a high rating is because most of the posts are from overseas.  If you are a back stabber than you have found your mecca.  The old employees are just there to ride their time out, don't bother to ask to learn anything, and after you get done asking they love to talk a out you in their 4 hour smoke shack meeting."
good,Infinitas gracias a esta empresa que me dio la oportunidad de crecer en lo profesional y personal durante 25 años
good,"I have been with my company for the past almost 11 years. We have had a new direction in management and I do not care for it. I have seen first hand what works and what does not. It is trul sad to be looking for a new job when I thought I was going to retire from here. This facility I work at has had a huge change in leadership as well as staffing. A lot of  employees have either taken early retirements or just left after 22 plus years of service. I feel it is just my time to leave due to the history and knowledge I have, for them to make the changes they would like to take place."
good,"Long hours! Rotating shifts no time for family. You never know if you have OT for the day, which can leave you stuck working 16 hours. Management is non existent. If you’re young and want the money go for it! If you have a family or small kids look the other way."
good,The company gives great opportunities if millennials like to expand their global knowledge by providing assignments in other countries.  The assignments allow people to learn about other culture and be able to move up in the company faster once the assignment is completed.  They also provide flex scheduled as well.
good,"Good learning environment, Staff is not so friendly, hours are long and expected. Changes take place too frequently. Good benefits, good compensation."
good,"I prefer not to answer this question.  Everyone experience is different, and I believe not to take advise from someone's personal experience, and suggest everyone take the chance of learning how they feel about the organization they choose to work for."
good,"Company has good products and pleasant, capable people but business does not grow because position roles and responsibilities are driven by HR and outside consultants instead of operating line managers.  Good opportunities for advancement if you can stay long enough but hard to predict when business winds change and downsizing will occur."
good,Ingredion was a good company that went bad. I was there a long time and saw the company deteriorate . The upper management change was inevitable. Sorry to leave but it was the right thing to do.
good,Benefits and pay scale were adequate for the duties required.  The atmosphere in the maintenance department is collaborative and relaxed.  There were always opportunities for growth and development.
good,24 hour process with too much variation in schedule. Too many ups and downs in the process. Management needs professionalism training. Communication between departments needs work.
good,"Empresa boa para se trabalhar, porém peca no reconhecimento dos funcionários, principalmente funcionários que estão a algum tempo na empresa. Por mais resultados que de, sempre valorizam mais funcionários que vem de fora."
good,"Aprendi muito trabalhando na ingredion , muita dinamica com colegas de trabalho , me forneceram varios treinamentos para melhorar o desempenho profissional ."
good,Very conservative company. On a journey to progress faster but has some hurdles to overcome. D&I has taken a stronger focus along with work life balance.
good,"Ambiente de trabajo regular "
good,"When I started this job, I need a different job that paid good with great benefits. Started off good and loved the overtime, paid vacation, paid holidays, and days off, but this company had turned a new leaf for the worse. The overtime was too much to handle at certain points, management has changed quicker than a revolving door, and no appreciation for going the extra mile. On top of all of this, I have no time for a life out of work and doesn't help that I have two kids that I want to remember me for being with them more than a couple hours out of the day."
good,"buena ,por que he aprendido a trabajar con gente de mucha experiencia que me proporciona más conocimientos a mí intelecto, y se aprende mucho cuando la empresa en la que presto mis servicios es una empresa multinacional, donde te valoran mucho como trabajador. apesar de ser un cooperado."
good,The experience was great. My management team was the best. The stuff was good. Very relax but fast pace. the smell is very powerful. didn't get a chance to work with the whole plant but everyone was okay.
good,It very demanding and fast pace with sometimes nil breaks .Verygood company to work for .which sometimes short days which means no wages .get sent home without pay.
good,Proceso de crecimiento muy lentos ya que no hay mivimiento de persona.
good,"Daily work could be something new or a regular routine with PM work orders."
good,Received good training of starches and its applications and also regulations for importing goods into Australia. The best part of the job was networking with customers and the ability to work close to home and work independently. There was some heavy lifting involved which got a bit hard in the last few months.
good,A great company to gain entry level experience and move up if you are in the inner circle. Typical corporate setting and expectations. Some of the people are good and some only care about themselves.
good,"Se trabaja muchisimo pero con mucha gratificaciòn por tener siempre buena respuesta e incentivo de la alta gerencia."
good,"Great room to grow, but little resources provided to do so.  Benefits average, payscale to match. they have begun outsourcing."
good,"Happy to work with Ingredion, we're like a family here since we are just few as this is just a sattelite office. Accounting experience is the most rewarding for me as I develop and enhance my skill specially in SAP-SRP accounting system."
good,"Excellent co-worker environment."
good,"fix and repair equipment all day long make welds to keep plant running. clean up after jobs. wish they would take care of their employees a lil better been there 4.5 years no raise have moved from beginning position up 4 positions, and no sign of advancement."
good,R&D driven environment with driven and motivated individuals.  Fast paced when priority projects arise.  Provides a good challenge to keep your mind constantly at work and increases agility.
good,"Nice people to work with, but company politics get in the way of hiring people or dumping workload on departments."
good,"Empresa multinacional la cual ha adquirido muchos beneficios para el empleado, muy comprometida con la seguridad, pero las posibilidades de ascenso o desarrollo son infimas ya que a nivel regional hacen pesar todo sobre Brasil"
good,"Empresa boa, porém a equipe interna trata os terceiros de uma forma não inclusiva."
good,"Foi uma boa experiencia de trabalho com bom clima organizacional , porem a Ingredion no Brasil esteve muito influenciada pela crise que afetou o brasil ."
good,"Cargas laborales pesadas, poco trabajo en equipo, mal ambiente laboral."
good,"I had never used SAP before coming here, and now I feel like a pro.  I learned that 3 screens is much much much better than just one.  Learned that lunch is optional.  Working 55+ hours per week for months on end gets no rewards, but being tardy by only a few minutes every day will get you in trouble."
good,I do not wish to write anything regarding this company may it be good or bad. Its a great company just need to start looking for a new position. Wish them the best
good,"Es una multinacional de producción masiva, cuyo fuerte es pa producción de ingredientes para la industria de alimentos."
good,"Great place to work and settle. Balance lifestyle and potential career growth, depends on what you are looking for and what department you are in.  Must enjoy your work."
good,"Its a work free environment.   "
good,"Un día típico en la empresa era llegar a buscar que todos los embarques programados salieran y entregaran en tiempo, de lo contrario revisar el retraso e informar a mi cliente interno y a mi jefe, aprendí la importancia del trabajo en equipo y la importancia de anticiparse a los riesgos de entrega y mantener informado al departamento de ventas de forma oportuna de los problemas en los embarques, con mis colegas había muy buena relación y armonía en el trabajo."
good,"there is a massive workload here and a very small team so time management is essential. However, when there is the rare lull, the team has a nice laugh together. The culture of the company is great fun"
good,"Um ótimo lugar para se trabalhar , boa empresa , bem organizada e dinâmica."
good,"If you're looking for a place that pays really well. then apply to Ingredion. Its really stressful, and they are willing to let you go at a wink of an eye."
good,"Ingredion is a very challenging job. You can expect to work 12 to 16 hour shifts.The type of work comes with lots of responsibilities. If each individual does his job well and works well with their fellow employees , the job becomes that much easier. If on the other hand a person doesn't  perform their job well it can cause a domino effect and lead to bad performances."
good,"Good place to work with lots of room to grow and try new positions. Will train if needed or desired for various activities/opportunities, Friendly coworkers and managers."

I have had the opportunity to better my communication skills by working with differing personalities."
good,Strategic bulk analysis and partnerships.
good,"Permite crecer personal y profesionalmente, y te motiva a crecer"
good,"Money making job. We work a continuous 7 day rotation, with the opportunity to write our own checks. Once you're trained correctly, all the various jobs are manageable."
good,"Friendly management, lots of breaks, everyone was helpful, union job. Paid great starting out, but work 7 days before getting 2 days off. Little time off and strict attendance policy."
good,"Tulsa office only - Worker bees are productive. Managers have meetings. The mgmt does not take any information from bees, only managers. Very much a Hive mentality where only the mgmt matters to the upper mgmt. All of the mgmt staff came from IBM in Tulsa (the place with zero clients left due to the mgmt style.) They brought IBM with them to Ingredion Tulsa SSC."
good,"fair place to work, day to day operations of the plant are mostly smooth sometimes the communication between management and its employees isn't the best but still a great job"
good,Cool people and a great place to get trained up. The rotation of the shifts was a bit hard on the home life but the pay was worth it. Just too bad they decided to close my plant down.

good,"Pac West Telecomm grew to be a major player in the telecomm industry and in the late 90's and early 2000's the company was quite large and booming.  Unfortunately the company did experience a change in business structure and sold part of the business and also reduced the work force.  While I was employed, the team was amazing.  I can't speak to the current group as I do not have experience with the Leadership but I do keep in contact with some still employed and they are happy to work at Pac-West."
good,"Trabalhado num Departamento dinâmico onde foi possível crescer profissionalmente e como pessoa, com bons relacionamentos em todos níveis hierárquicos."
good,"The typical day at work includes preparing loads of dry dextrose to be picked up for their scheduled appointment times, and maintaining a clean and safe workplace.  Management, and co-workers are always willing to help out anyone who needs it.  The most difficult part of the job is when there are mechanical issues that delay the process.  The part of this job that is the most enjoyable is being able to work with enormous machines and equipment that most people would never be able to see."

good,"The folks who work at Ingredion, and the company philosophy, is great. The pace was fast and competitive, but you could collaborate (and were encouraged to collaborate) with peers. Science and rigor were high-quality. The only real problem is that the work keeps shifting from facility to facility, so you had to be prepared to move or move on."
good,Union environment. Like what I do. Learned skills from other co workers. You have some communication to work with via coworkers managers and outside contractors or turck drivers.  Pay is higher than most jobs that do the same thing.

El grupo de trabajo que conocí y labore, es de excelentes profesionales y personas, proactivas y serviciales en pro del crecimiento de la compañía y a nivel de individuo. Apoyándose con valores corporativos muy necesarios como lo es la seguridad, respeto y servicio. Las instalaciones tanta a nivel de oficinas de manufactura, como la planta como tal y los laboratorios de calidad y O&D son muy adecuados y eficientes en cuanto a la disposición de equipos. Se preocupaban continuamente por mejorar los procesos y tener inocuidad en los mismos. Una gran cultura de ZERO (defectos, desperdicios, entre otros) enfocados en el fortalecimiento de la metodología TPM.

good,"Ingredion es una Compañía Multinacional que se dedica a la producción de almidones y Jarabes de maiz. Un dia típico tiene muchas tareas, llamadas telefónicas y mucha presión por información de parte de la Casa matriz y de la Gerencia Local. Ingredion fue mi casa por espacio de 34 años y lo que tengo y lo que soy se lo debo a esta Compañía. Hay un muy buen ambiente entre los colegas y un muy buen trabajo en equipo. La parte más dificil del trabajo es la presión por lograr los resultados pues los Targets son muy retantes. Lo que más me gustó del trabajo mientras estuve alí es que es variado pues cada día puedes tener retos diferentes"

good,"La empresa Ingredion es una empresa transnacional que cuenta con un excelente ambiente laboral, es una empresa socialmente responsable que siempre se ha distinguido entre las mejores opciones para laborar en la región, tiene un gran compromiso con el bienestar de sus empleados y con la comunidad donde opera, solo que en el área en la que actualmente me desarrollo, las oportunidades de crecimiento son limitadas."

good,Ingredion was a very nice place to work. I was there for over 25 years. My department shut down and I retired. I'm not old yet 😎 so I'm looking for new opportunities. I learned a lot at Ingredion and was blessed to have worked there
good,Over the last thirty years I have learned different positions and skills and have done well. I do get along with people within the company and try to maintain a healthy attitude.

Used Concur for  company Master Card purchases for office supplies, lunches, etc.   "
good,"I would typically cover newly formed corn chutes with bags in the morning, then very selectively hand-pollinate hundreds of corn plants throughout the day. I was able to apply some classroom genetics knowledge to the artificial selection of corn to produce the desired effect. The management was demanding and focused, but easy-going as long as the job got done. Most co-workers were rewarding to work with, but some were only there for a few days they decided to not work anymore, most likely because the job was fairly physically demanding. Once the workflow was developed, the job became more fun as the co-workers got along very well."
good,"The work environment was satisfactory in regards to safety and salary. The supervisor was reasonable and friendly. The work involved killing weeds, counting corn, and hand-pollinating corn. I learned what products are made with corn starch and the multiple different types of corn starch. The hot weather was the hardest part of the job as the work took place during the heat of summer and was outside without much shade. The co-workers made the job enjoyable."
