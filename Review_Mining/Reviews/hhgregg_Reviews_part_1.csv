rating,review
bad,"I worked for this company for 16.5 years. They closed in June, 2017. The last two years were not good at all. A complete shift in company culture was the demise of the company."
bad,Good company but folded years back. I enjoyed working there but always heard the optimist side that all is good. Then found out it closed. This was a few years ago
bad,"Closed down 3 Years ago, went out of business. Went bankrupt. Closed down. Upper management ran the company into the ground. Yet they walk away well off."
bad,"Undoubtedly hhgregg was the worst company I ever worked for. The regional manager was racist, lazy, indolent & CYA in all situations & left his people out to dry. The upper management all jumped ship after it was obviously failing & showed no concern for their line level managers & associates."
bad,They suck company was run by x out of work out of ideas hasbens they put people in position that were far from qualified management was teribal. Hope they come back with better management
bad,Working at HHgregg was interesting to say the least. I worked in the store warehouse and I did anything from unloading trucks to cleaning the store to helping customers. Management treated me very well but there was no growth for me within the company. HHGregg is now permanently closed.
bad,"I would never suggest this company to any jobseekers, which felt more like a scam for the payment compensation. Do not work there if you can avoid it."
bad,"Very little sales training, thrown to the wolves. If you asked questions, you were a problem. You never knew you were on the way out until that time comes and, you're gone!"
bad,"Unrealistic goals created high employee turnover rate."
bad,This job is horrible didn’t care about their customer that purchased very large items from them.. Place had got closed down for business and wanted their employees to work up until the last day the business was closed
bad,"theyre closed down forever. pretty easy as a cashier/customer service representative. I didn't learn much. Cash handling experience is a must. If you sell, you make LOTS of commission"
bad,"their closed for business, I however enjoyed helping customers get what they needed."
bad,Out of business. Alot of standing around waiting for customers to come into the store with the hopes that they would purchase furniture. There was an actual furniture store across the parking lot.
bad,Company no longer in business no review is needed for this company because you would be unable to apply for an position within this company.  While I was there it was a decent company.
bad,"Best pay was achieved thru selling beds, which I did, but heavy price competitiveness made it near impossible to make minimum wage.  Likely why they closed tried to be walmart of appliances."
bad,"I was a contractor ,hard worker, and didn’t see and progress at hhgregg. I had a very good relationship with everybody I was just work to much and didn’t have time to go to school and etc."
bad,"Privately Run - Now out of business.  Fast paced, rules always changing, company did not value family or employees.  Alot of changes made without input of those that actually new the work first hand."
bad,the company is closed and nolonger available for anyone to work there. I did enjoy working at the company. Very sad that it closed. We were like a family and I miss being there.
bad,"H H Gregg was very unorganized upon my arrival into the company. As a new Store Operations Manager learning about H H Gregg's vision, there were 3 or 4 General Manager changes in the first six months of employment. Stressful experience not having a consistent system to the daily task of my position below the General Manager."
bad,"I hated every minute of this job."
bad,I liked working there until us employees found out at the same time the public found out they were going under and it was basically like a house of cards. Everything started falling apart shortly after and the good employees left quickly leaving warehouse people to be on the sales floor. They closed for good so no probably don't want to work there again.
bad,"management was young and overly agressive,would not recommend"
bad,"out of business. cannot rate based on the fact that hhgregg does not exist any more.  while i worked there i liked it, but no one will ever work there again"
bad,Atmosphere was good. Commission structure was flawed . dishonest with consumer. Not paid for the hours worked off the sales floor.whole company was flawed and went bankrupt
bad,"The management would change my sales tickets, giving my commission to a favored employee. Not just at the store I worked, but all stores. HhGregg still owes me money."
bad,"...and not surprised.  The commissions are the worst of any company I've ever worked at, and the pay structure is designed to give the salesman as little as possible."
bad,"It's okay. I have the memory of the great first dog, and everybody loves the Mini Hut, they won't miss my business. "
bad,"All the stores closed because of poor mgt  I reached out to the board and CEO.  This resulted in a phone conversation but no action, after closing they did thank me for the ideas."
bad,"Never work it. The people were bad. Management was bad. It was a straight commission job, so it didnt pay, unless you sold, their prices were so high it was hard to sell things......"
bad,I signed on as the company changed leadership due to losing money. Pay and benefits were cut. Commissions were the bread and butter and they were cut drastically. They went out of business this year.
bad,"This company is closing all of their store locations. During the time they were open, they provided customer service for appliances and electronics..."
bad,Mismanaged company lost profits and bad balance sheet and cash flow was taken out of employee compensation.  Went out of business it was no surprise to management.
bad,this company is no longer in business so there's not really much to say about the company anymore.  the actions of senior leadership was the demise of the company.
bad,This is a company that wasn't thought through properly. Instead of concentrating on a item/items that would have kept afloat; they choose to sell and market too many different ventures.
bad,"HHgregg is now out of business for good reason. This company often lied to it's customers. I left because I felt morally wrong for doing so. Employees were often encouraged by management to lie about MSRP prices, sale prices, and service plans. This was all done to sell and make commission."
bad,"Horrible place too much to list. to add characters i will say this company going out of buisines has been a great thing to happen, their management team was hand picked by buddies and friends taking advantage of their pull in the co. Which lead to their demise."
bad,"under paid over worked, dog eat dog world no team playing. no consideration of family work balance. I would not recommend anyone work for this company"
bad,no review to write i enjoyed my job while the store was open i would still be working there had they not shut down its unfortunate all those people lost their jobs
bad,"The company went out of business because the practice that they had in place just did not work. The compensation was not good, the turn over rate was the highest I ever saw."
bad,The company wasn't great. No work and life balance. Long hours every day trying to make customer happy without having any support. Upper management made big mistakes and that is why the company is no longer existing.
bad,Obviously they failed. Screwed over thousands of employees while their CEO made off like a bandit. Everyone worked on 100%commission. however you were expected to clean and do store resets.
bad,Do I have to say more this is a Bankrupt Company. C level and district managers ran a great company from having no debt to becoming a company that is liquidating everything.
bad,"I can say this HH gregg in Fayetteville NC was a gregg place to work until corperate got greedy and now over 5,000 workers are out of a job so on may 15th will be my last day..........."
bad,Typical work hours during holidays can exceed 70 hours per week. They promise opportunity for advancement but do not follow through. Management keeps you in the dark in relation to the well being of the company.
bad,"Not a proactive environment, always overreacting to bad management decisions and company's lack of accountability to employees, but more importantly, to their customers."
bad,Very disappointed that they are closing down so many stores and only giving its employees less than 60 days notice to find new employment with no severance payouts
bad,I would only suggest the young and the desperate to ever consider working here. Upper Management is awful and does nothing positive to help sales associates or store managers progress in life.
bad,"Place is not a good place to work. New warehouse has cost company millions of dollars, customers not getting there product and nothing in stock. Free labor is a must that you provide everyday, managers do nothing except set in the office or in a chair somewhere all day."
bad,"You will work long hours with little pay or respect,  no time off,  management changes your schedule without your approval and expect you to agree.  Not a very good culture."
bad,Worst job ever. Starting from the top all the way down to the level one associate the company is crooked. They run the staff into the ground for the pennies they pay them.
bad,"I work for the company for several months. The people you will work with are really good people but management is the worse. They talk badly about the employees and treat them badly as well. They are unfair with their practices. They lie to get people to do things for them. They will change your schedule and won't tell you and expect you to know. They will ask you to do more than your job title and not pay you for it. The managers are rude they don't even have the decency  to speak back when spoken to sometimes. They lack effective communication. When you complain to your manager about something he will always turn it around on you never taking what you are saying into consideration. They will say rude things to you out of their mouths. I was told by my manager I needed to use common sense  for a mistake a different  Manger had made and I was also told they could get anyone to push buttons which was quite rude and ruined the respect I had at the time for my manager. They don't train effectively  they give you 2 days then throw you into the fire and expect you to have it down. This all in all was a bad job and not worth the money. "
bad,This company will soon no longer exist. Too much miscommunication and management is poor when it comes to training. I did not have fun working here nor did I make enough money due to the lack of customers and it was a 100% commission based job.
bad,When I first started there we had different management. Then slowly each left and things went downhill from there. Safe to say I'm glad I no longer offer my services to them.They have extremely poor customer service skills. When a customer wants to return and they're allowed management will change the policy to fit certain scenarios.
bad,"I worked for this company for 2 months and the things i witness were beyond unbelievable . We were doing things so unethical i decided to leave and file to the BBB, The call center was mice infested which was in a old warehouse with leaking pipes. Roaches and other bugs were found, Di which was one of the call center managers stated they had a bed bug out break 2 years ago. Besides the filth, the company would resale old products that were returned from customers home and sold at the same marketing price. We were advised to hang up the call if anyone brought up legal matters concerning that issue. Also we were told we could reissue rebate cards or exchange products if we feel as if the customer was honest. The company went off of personal feelings towards the customer instead of the policy and procedures they instructed us to use. I would never recommend anyone to the call center. there is only 12 people who work in the call center total. Bad business all together. Jessica Royal, Rhonda Curtis, Rebecca Jacobs, Joanne Sears are all in upper management and practice illegal business. DO NOT QUIT YOUR JOB TO GO TO THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY,"
bad,management was horrible i believe it was under new management and i know several other people quit around the time i did.
bad,"the management was very rude and had asked that i quit because i was looking elese where for employment, I was just curious if therewas a place closer that would be better suited for me in a worst case scenario. that is really all i did not like about it plus draw"
bad,"get ready for a welfare check, management will lie on you and say that you did something wrong when it comes time for raises so that they wont have to give you one. Management throws you under the bus when the big wigs walk through. Someone put a dent in my car in the parking lot, told management to look at cameras,, never did it. This company is racists and sucks!!!!!!!!!"
bad,I have worked for HHgregg for 3 years and I was looking for advancement to be a bit sooner. There is a lot of places to move yet I want to stay in sarasota
bad,"A company that is living off of values that are from the 50's. They are compatible with the workplace of today. Stay far away,"
bad,"I'm surprised this company hasn't gone under... yet. Management anywhere from the store level to the district manager to the upper level CEO's doesn't care about their employees. New hires quit or just no call/no show once they see how S-L-O-W as molasses the stores are and find out about their draw commission/payment system (*if whoever is reading this doesn't know how a draw based commission system works, do yourselves 2 favors: do a Google search on it and check out the store at various times of the week Before applying there - you'll immediately see what I mean*). I could go on and on, but quite frankly have better things to do with my time... like finding just about any other job."
bad,"Very inconsiderate of you as an employee, it was one of those dead end jobs where you feel trapped once you are there. Wouldn't recommend anyone to apply for work there, not unless management has changed"
bad,worst gm  in any retail I have ever been associated with slow every body fighting for one sale commission sucks u only make .01 on most stuff then if u don't get a customer u owe the company money in a draw  training is different every other day
bad,"Recently they degraded our pay and added more work to our duties. Management consistently uses toxic leadership styles to coarse people into adopting ever changing policies, which sometimes change roughly 3-5 times a year, by threatening to take your sale. There is no hourly wage so if your sale is taken it hurts bad. Company introduced a plan to save itself 200,000,000$. 50,000,000$ of that was cut from operating costs, which created a garbage commission structure based on volume instead of profit. Nearly every veteran salesman has left the company already. If you have a knack for punishment it's a good employer, but only for people who have no emotions. The way you're treated went from good to REALLY bad in as short as 4 months."
bad,Bad regional manager and bad store manager. Was there for a long time. The sales people need to be fired and they need to rehire.
bad,"the pay sucks, there is no room to grow inside the company. every time u get ready to move up then change the structure of the company and remove positions so they keep you at minium wage"
bad,"I have never worked at a place where people were a disposable commodity before.  If you like to be used, this place is for you."
bad,Very poor management. only hire employees for 90 days then fire you. hire you under false pretenses and when you complain about them they fire you
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked in my life. Management team was very negative and short sighted. Some employees were very dis-honest and would steal customers from you if you didn't keep your eye on them. "
bad,This company does not care about its employees. The pay is only commission based no hourly rate. All they care about is dollar signs. the commission structure is set up totally wrong to where only the company makes money. the only way to make money is to sell protection plans. you only get 12% on profit for products (with the sales they run especially around the holidays or any open box items you only make volume of 1 to 3%because there is no profit). they will schedule you overtime on slow weeks and there are no cuts. the schedule is screwed up. oh and some of the management are very rude. i do not recommend this company to work for if you are someone that needs stable income and want to have some time with theyre families especially around the holidays.
bad,"Don;'t really have much to say except you don't make anything and you only get 15-20 hours per week."
bad,Weather it is corporate or at store level this company is shady...... They will cost you money so be careful. And they don't Care if you are a loyal employee or not.
bad,"This is the worst job I ever had. The management does not care at all. They just want to keep people to make it through the holidays. They have no inventory most of the time, sales associates steal constantly from each other. The only way to make any money is to work 24/7 and don't take lunch. Work 10 to 12 hours a day and some days you make no money due to the fact that there are no customers.  I have worked commission in other industries and made money but there is no way to do so here. When you interview they lie and say average associate makes $50,000 well that is far from true! Most are making what equates to about $10.00 per hour for standing on a hard cement floor for 10 hours. All they care about is PSP which is their extended warranty program. If you do not sell enough you are chastised constantly. Also, everyone knows what you make! All you do is pull up the commission report and can see what everyone makes, how in the work is this able to happen? there has to be some kind of law against it! Run as fast as you can away from this company!!"
bad,I worked with hhgregg for four years never did anything wrong I had a manager that would bully us talk us down make fun of our weight or call some of us slow literally 24/7 verbal abuse even sexually assaulted a coworker we put in several complaints they did nothing that same manager didn't put in my time for one week I worked due to him being late I went and fixed my time myself cause I got impatient and was done asking and done with missing money on my paychecks I got fired hhgregg only cares about there sales managers and GM's there hourly associates and there commission associates get the shaft SCREW HHGREGG I honestly hope they close down if you want to be miserable for the rest of your life work here if not don't give this place the time of day!!!!!
bad,terrible place to work. company doesnt care for employees.
bad,company laid off top producers to cut costs would not even offer job for lees hourly wage than what you averaged.
bad,not happy with job at all.... management is rude. I wanna find a better job that i can advance in.
bad,"stand around cleaning or restocking."
bad,"my boss was the most incompetent person who I have actually ever met in my life very old and frail, drove both the electronics manager & appliances manager crazy.(actually watched a manager quit because of him) I loved the business, I loved the customers, but the carelessness of my general manager over all made me quit...I am white, so I don't like it when people throw around the race card, and I never do but I know for a fact personally that this man was a racist (for personal reasons). My general manager actually sat there and watched a intoxicated customer verbally abuse me and then forced me to ring up THE SALES PERSONS CUSTOMER so that she could get credit for it so that she could go and try to jump into somebody else's sale and split the credit for it. he cared about absolutely nobody but the sales people, gave me absolutely no credit or showed absolutely no appreciation for the fact that I fixed so many sales peoples mistakes & made him more business. I like to seek appreciation for my work ethic. I know I'm a very hard worker and I take pride I my work. The only thing that made it worth staying there was all the fun I had with my co workers we laughed and had some really fun times I will never forget. It was not a hard job at all I found it to be very easy and actually very fun as well as somewhat challenging, but with a broken process (or bad management) your store will run horribly."
bad,"H.H. Gregg is a horrible place to work for a warehouse associate. Pay is not fair, managers are terrible and disrespectful, and too much work is expected, especially for such low wages."
bad,They sell you a dream and give you the garbage. Worst company I have ever worked for.
bad,"unethical commission stealing between reps, unpaid 12 trips for training, works on a draw commission system. You only get 10 percent of the profit of an item."
bad,"Run....Very sad culture.....Low salary for managers, and ridiculous hours and schedule."
bad,"HHGREGG is the worst company to work for and they do not care about their employees. You work on FULL comission.. which means you dont sell, you dont make money. The manager gave me a whole speech about how she made tons of money and in reality the managers there only cared about their paycheck. I was never trained well, or anything. "
bad,Too much work for too little pay as a customer service merchandiser.
bad,Not a good job its based on commission only the work days are very slow a lot of hours you have to pay the company back
bad,great and amazing store managers treat employees horribly and there are no chances to advance in this company you only receive 1% commission 
bad,"I worked with everyone at the store for 8 months. The draw system is very bad for anyone who is willing to put in the hours, And end up owing the company money due to not making enough the previous week."
bad,"The pay system is absolutely awful, you have no life at this job. Management is bad."
bad,"Employees work long extended hours with up to three 12 hour shifts a week even when there are no customers to sell to. Management is fairly non existent as far as leadership within the store, they serve as puppets for corporate."
bad,"Emails, large inventory counts, schedules, checking in truck, stocking sales floor, expected to fix all customer issues reguardless if from store or warehouse, correcting invoices, merchandising, transferring products out of store and planograms."
bad,Terrible place to work and I would not recommend anyone to work there. Minimum wage for a warehouse job
bad,"This place is awful. If you do anything besides sales, good luck advancing in this company. Management treats working there like its Highschool. The people management likes get to keep their job and are allowed to get away with murder. The people that management dislikes are abused, and let go. Outside of the Holidays this company does no business at all."
bad,"HHGregg salesman is purely commission-paid salesman. You have to go out for training on your days-off, but get no pay. When there is wrong calculation of commission, there is no answer or money back even evidence and documents are showed to managers. It's not an educated working place. You'd heard about terminations of Regional Manager, Store Managers and salesmen."
bad,i dislike this company they favor certain people and allow them to get away with anything. the work load is placed on the unfavored and they cut hours randomly and give them to the favored i disliked working at this company. they have no ethics or respect for anyone
bad,"Sales business, not operational any more. Company closed.................................................."
bad,Used to be great but they lost the culture that made them great. CEO was short sighted and could not stay relevant in today's fast paced marketplace and meeting consumer demands.
bad,"All positions (with the exception of management) are commission-based, with little to no foot traffic coming in the door. Many associates are brought in by friends and are unqualified for employment. One gentleman was known to be selling marijuana in the parking lot of HHGregg while he was on the clock. Management had knowledge of this but would not do anything because they were friends who partied together on the weekends. Overall the most unprofessional work environment I have ever witnessed, glad I left!"
bad,10-15 hours everynight. Management is terrible dont care about your well being. Throughout the 3 years ive seen about 50-60 people join then quit. I and 2 other people were veterans. Even the whole management were new. The pay was terrible and not worth the hours. Terrible benefits. If your good they will work you dead in one night. Always understaffed. You'll find yourself having to stop your work to do a 3 man job and still have your work to do. Theres no team.
bad,"This company has horrible training, strong lack of mature and professional leadership, and bad customer service standards.  All of the workers are immature and people aren't excited to help customers even though that's how they make their money. Also, the high salaries promised can't possibly happen because the poor customer service has run everyone to Best Buy. It's highly unfortunate because I was looking forward to become a manager there... Maybe another retail store will work better."
bad,"This company does not offer room for advancement of their sales staff.  Sales Associates work against draw on commission basis and  commission rates are routinely cut by company, product often sold at cost, all resulting in poor rates of pay."
bad,"Working for Hhgregg was a terrible experience. when I started there in Sep. 2013, we had plenty of customer traffic and sales. Since the Sales positions are commission based, having customers is a great thing, pay was great. then earlier this year (2015) commission payouts were cut in half, and foot traffic dwindled to almost nothing. Most weeks I was barely making enough in sales to equal minimum wage. the management turn over rate was so high, It seemed like there was a new manager on a weekly basis. No home/life balance, no holidays except for Christmas. I've worked retail before Hhgregg and no other company treated their employees as bad as Hhgregg. Unless you are looking for something to temporarily get you by, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
bad,"Job was not bad initially but has steadily gone downhill.  This is a commission based sales position and customer traffic in the store has decreased steadily.  Very, very difficult to make a steady paycheck. About 6 months ago they cut the commission rates by about 30 percent so you have fewer customers coming in the store and you're making less money from the sales you get.  You need about 7 to 10 sales a day in order to take home a decent days pay and on most days you won't talk to anywhere near that many customers. The company has also cut down on operations staff such as warehouse and cashiers so salespeople are called upon to do various other tasks such as cleaning for free."
bad,This is the worst job I ever had. The company always changing rules and regulations. The company does not care about their employees at all. Managers are so lazy and are always in a bad mood. They are only closed two days out the year. And they pay way to little for all the work they want you to do. If you like no family time and little pay this is the job for you.
bad,"Keep taking money away from sales people, it's always there fault not a sales friendly place.  Good sales people but that is where it stops.  You must get a 5 star service for the sale but again that's where it stopped."
bad,Management hyped up the company saying you will make so much more than the job we were at to quit and work for them. They over staffed the place having more people working on the floor than customers in the store. The sytem they had to make money and keep you out of not making money was no very well thought. no one could make enough do to over staffing. The only reason they over staff was because of christmas and the grand opening. Manager was horrible never wanted to help out all about himself. They knew they were getting rid of half the store so he was going around saying he has to pull his guns out and fire people. It was a very poor management and enviroment.
bad,Worked for this company for 3years management changed every other month they played favorites I was top 3 in my region for years was promised promotion but they would bring ppl in as managers which by the way the pride themselves on promoting from within total bs do yourself a favor do not work here ever
bad,"Pushed warranties too hard.  People where not ethical in ""writing a sale in your number"".  I can sell, but the jealousy was not worth having to deal with on an every day basis."
bad,"Poor communications. No loyalty, no follow up or consistent coaching or training."
bad,This company is no longer in business. There were 234 stores that went bankrupt. Alot of employees were without a job no compensation and there wer no benefits given at the time of closing.
bad,"It was a very bad experience at this company, I worked there 4 years and received 1 raise. The manager was not very friendly. I just stayed as long as I did because I couldn't find another job at that time"
bad,"When I first started there, it was a great place to work, the culture invoked a family atmosphere, one of caring, and mentoring. As the struggles of the retail world began to unfold, along came management changes. The company is in terrible shape and will likely not survive. They recently laid off 70 employees, some who had been working for them for more than 10 years. No loyalty to any employees, just about the stock price. The company is likely to be listed from the NYSE and the downward spiral will continue."
bad,"I see a company that is headed backwards. The GM is a boss not "
bad,"The days are often long and you tend to have periods of time where no one walks in the door. Pay is commission based and even if you do get someone to buy the commission percentage should be illegal. Draw system is completely flawed. Managers very demanding and rude, mostly care about their paychecks not the customer or employees under them."
bad,"The company is in complete chaos... Delivery, installation, replenishment, and extended warranty issues are constant. No accountability on what is happening, or not happening with these parts or contractors. So much confusion from delivery center and its CONSTANT turnover. Delivery center and corporate office is rude to customers, hang up on them regularly, or blind transfer to a random store. Then leave us to be the face of the organization, the one to be threatened and screamed at on the sales floor. Corporate and store staff reductions have left it in the hands of managers to be involved with every issue, while driving sales, recruiting, on-boarding, training, merchandising, etc."
bad,"They don't give any sales training at all. They don't respect their employees. There's always one or two people there who will steal customers from you. Management won't do anything because their pay is the same no matter who sells. They also rig their pay. If anyone makes a good paycheck, they hire more people until you stop making good paychecks. Thinning out the customers you get. The company got so focused on growing fast, they threw any halfway decent salesman into management. Problem is, a good salesman doesn't necessarily make a good manager."
bad,"Hhgregg will end up like circuit city in the next few years. They are constantly changing their policies, commission structure has changed twice since I've been there. "
bad,horrible place to work; does not care about their employees
bad,"The Newport News HHGregg is horrible and I would not suggest anyone work at this site or the Virginia Beach site. Had to resign from the job due to racial discrimination. Every day there was someone making rude remarks about African Americans and it was just unbearable; and to make it worse some of the comments were said around management or came from management and yet nothing was done. Interviews were held by the Regional Manager for each individual involved in this racial discrimination case to get everyone's story but yet nothing was done. Letters were sent to NAACP, 10 on your side, and along with others but still nothing was done. Because I was unable to tolerate it any longer I decided to resign. I now hear that the Newport News store has loss a lot of employees and the regional manager and general manager were demoted from their promotions they received not long after I resigned. All I have to say about that is you can't do wrong and think nothing will come back on you. Doing someone wrong will only end up affecting you negatively."
bad,Very poorly run company they work you into the ground and pay you very little. They change cost favor them as far as compensating you. Very bad overall very high turnover.Most of time you are standing around doing nothing.
bad,A typical day at this job is arriving on time ready to work. The management could do a better job of how they treat their employees. The co-workers are pretty professional. The hardest part of this job is the slow pace. The most enjoyable part about the job are the customers.
bad,"Stores all closing, doesn't really matter.  97 stores are all closing, what more can I tell you about this position in my region?"
bad,rarely has product in stock. expect you to sell but never deliver. Delivery center also is horrible. Pay structure changes regularly and not to associate benefit
bad,"Horrible environment. Company soon to go bankrupt. Under-staffed, unappreciated, horrid management. Commission system is manipulated to underpay salespeople... The entire company is untrained and left to the weak leadership of weak managers."
bad,"Operations:  Open store, print reports, count cash, open registers, check emails, check employee scheduling, check recruiting website for new hiring candidates.  Check inventory and make sure it is consistent with stock inventory levels."
bad,"Working at HH Gregg you must have a go and get it attitude every day. The reason thats being said is the pay is all commission and the customers are very limited at times. If you do not have the drive to try and make every sale you will not survive. Working at HH Gregg helped me develop good sales experience and gave me building blocks to take to a new sales job. Management did not give me proper training so I had to learn everything on my own in a matter of two months. The best part about going to work were my co-workers, they made the day easy to get through."
bad,"shortest day of work was a 10 hour day. In that day the manager has to be involved in every single price adjustment, every single thing in lockup. the only reason you need other employees is to type tickets. The customer service and supervisors hold no power. As far as a company goes, they don't care at all, Ive talked to the SVP and DVP and other executives, they laugh at the staff and have no problem disrespecting other members of mgmt, hhgregg for a manager or supervisor, awful place to work, you'll never know what your family looks like and god forbid you need to miss a day, you won't. they take from your vacation and personal days if lets say you get sick even. Just awful, don't work here as a manager."
bad,Very poorly managed company. Laid me off due to workforce reductions and then hired two more people to replace me. Makes sense.
bad,Terrible incompetent management. Uneven and unreliable pay structure.
bad,"A majority of the co-workers are great. However, like any other small work place, there are those who can get away with breaking the rules and NOT working for an entire shift and there are those who get harassed and watched every step of the way. The way the company works is not right, and I'm sure not even legal. You don't get paid for the full time you're there, like if you close and you're only scheduled until 9pm, the managers can keep you there to make you do all of the work that the front end was supposed to do and you'd work for free after 9 basically. You also get an hour lunch. Most times, you're scheduled for 7 hours, which gives you 6 working hours. Other times you're scheduled for 9-12 hours and your hour breaks are taken out. You have to pay for your uniforms. When you're a salesman, you're expected to make a daily quota and if you don't make that, you have to pay the company from your next pay check. I've heard of commission, but nothing like that. Nothing makes sense. You get no where financially.  "
bad,worst job ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the managers and workers are messy and childish!!
bad,"The company no longer exists, the went bankrupt. I was never offered any other options to transfer to the new store which is called "
bad,"The hhgregg went out of business in Maryland.  There was not enough foot traffic to keep the stores open."
bad,This was actually a great job to have at first. The money was great but sometimes you did have long hours to work. The company made bad financial decision and closed.
bad,This company had far to high expectations on how much they wanted you to sell without a strong enough customer base. Many times employees would get in trouble for not meeting the base standards when there weren't customers to sell to. The company never looked after their employees.
bad,The staff was on one accord very helpful toward one another' but the management was often disorganized and confused at times.
bad,Would be good job if treated employees better...they locked doors to warehouse gave 30 min breaks after every 6hrs and then work 15+hr shifts. They try to sell 13.50 but it's not worth the work ethic that they ask you to put in. Only get this job if you want no life. 15+ hr shifts 5 days a week so you sleep on off days. Time moved up and still ends up doing 15hrs per day no matter what. No position for growth ! You have to pull orders yourself and load a truck in 3 hours....news flash don't ask what you cannot do. Employer need to know we appreciate a job but don't try to take workers for granted.
bad,"Worked with a variety of people, internal & external. Great appliances, electronics, furniture & bedding for anyone looking to furnish new home or just remodel."
bad,"I have nothing really nice to say about the corporate office level, so I will leave it at that, but the store level was a blast to work at! Just had to handle the consistent changes that were handed down from the corp office!"
bad,"the management is horrible, they dont train with anything. the hardest part about the job is to do the work with out the proper equipment."
bad,"Horrible management, nothing to strive for. Treated like a slave. Do not expect to get a promotion or have any chance for advancement based off of your job performance. They only hire friends."
bad,"They tell you, you r going make so much money during grandoppening, and then nobody does. Thats the beigining of the draw program which bad."
bad,Due to poor management they filed bankruptcy and then went out of business. We were given little notice and then they laid a lot off earlier than expected.
bad,Despite what you mite be told in a interview the hours are very long . You will constantly be lied to about what time you should get off. The pay is ok but to make any real money you won't be able to see your family . There is no set  schedule management changes it as the see fit .
bad,"Warehouse shifts are from 12 hours, from open to close. Bad work environment with a terrible general manager."
bad,"Since this company is no longer in service I can't recommend it to family or friends, but overall, not a bad company to work for in my opinion.  The people were cut-throat, don't get me wrong, but it was sales, and sales industry in general screams cut-throat because you are playing an active role in how much you bring home there, since it was 100% commission, which means if you didn't make enough to earn minimum wage that month, the company would spot you enough that you didn't make in sales, but then once you made enough in sales, the company would deduct the amount you owed from your slow month from you, so during slow periods you work for less than nothing, you work to pay back the loan the company gave you to meet minimum wage requirements.  Overall, a tough company to work for, but not really a bad one, they were fair, at least to me."
bad,"Went out of business with no severance package."
bad,"Stress is the daily routine. With little overlapping management coverage, the duties are sometimes overwhelming. The bar for sales and customer service has been set high, so high that the majority of the day is spent dealing one on one with customers and issues. Great people and relationships."
bad,"The managers in the store were the best; very understanding if you had to call off or come in late; very scratch my back I'll scratch yours atmosphere. As for the corporate officials, I could not say the same thing. They could not keep stock in the warehouse, their control of the warehouse was minimal as many of the deliveries were cancelled due to losing of a product or during delivery the product got damaged.  Now with them closing 90 stores across the Eastern United States and Chicagoland area, they are not offering any severance packages for any of the workers in those stores. All in all not a company I plan to work for ever again."
bad,Terrible compensation. Great employees. Rotating door. low Pay. Bad bosses. dirty stinky hard cold unorganized. selfish
bad,"Great place to work! ...If you're not a salesman. I've worked there for a few months and I lost my job because I was too far in draw. "
bad,"the overall company was okay but since they went out of business with over 5000 employess my review of the them would be terrible, it was a lot of things I would have changed about the company even before the demise"
bad,This company was horrible and there is a reason that it went out of business and it should have stayed out of business. They truly are a horrible company.
bad,"when I started there it was family owned and a fantastic company.  At the end it was public owned and not a good place at all.  People used to care, at the end no one cared."
bad,this is the worst company i have ever worked for they have no sympathy for staff around holidays and expect the only two good checks they will ever receive to be worth sacrificing time with family
bad,"i didn't really like the job it was a bad environment and a bad management. It was not a very good experience for me, I answered phones and handled customer complaints and emails."
bad,I just didn't click with this job it was all commission the managers were horrible
bad,"i loved it,a great job opportunity but too bad it was cut short because it was seasonal for me"
bad,"Management team is very unorganized, Loved working with customers and resolving issues. "
bad,Really great place to work with great management. A lot of room for advancement. Unfortunately they went out of business and caused thousands of people to be out of a job.
bad,The company was an ok company work for . Very low paid employees and very low raises. Employees were awesome and very fun to work with though. Unfortunately they have gone out of business
bad,"DO not work for this company. They do not care about there employees. Commission rates are a joke. If a customer comes in looking for the tv in the AD that was $99 dollars they expectif  you to upsale them to a 2000 dollar TV which is very unrealistic . During the holidays you will work 50-60 hour weeks which is commission so you have to sell Allot . Black Friday you will work at 24hr shift. During  slow times there very over staffed which mean you make no money, If you do work there dont make friends its very cut-throat."
bad,"We are way over worked. My manager claims he hired us on our personalities and expects us to have the same one when your putting in 70 hour weeks. My manager has even put hands on me. I feel sick at the sight of this place and never see my family, but this store isn't ever busy and your pay reflects that. All the managers play favorites and let certain people do anything they want, while you get stuck in a low commission rut. On Black Friday, we worked 24 hours, and now we here next year, we have to be here at 5 pm on Thanksgiving to open at 6. Great place to work, if you live your work. Oh, and somehow to date, we are missing a ton of money from our pay checks."
bad,cant stick to keeping promises on wages and raises. Mangement was poorly.
bad,"Handle any and all customer service issues."
bad,"HH Gregg wants 99% profit and does not leave any money on the table for people trying to make a living.  They do not spend money on advertising to bring customers in the door. It's fine for somebody that lives at home and no responsibilities. Even a dog likes to chew on a bone with some meat on it. Not so at hh gregg. They want all the money, example; $1,833.00. $2,633.00  and give their Sale Associates who sell the merchandise only 1%, 1.5%, 2.0% . That is disgraceful and downright greedy."
bad,"Would not give raises, no matter how hard you worked. Were not flexible with family life, or issues. Expected to do work that was not in the job description."
bad,"typical day - stand on feet 8 hours   learned - about retail & commission   Management - money-hungry, greedy, didn't care about their employees-- Co-workers were congenial for the most part and most are seeking other jobs-- hardest part of the job-- standing and doing nothing -- most enjoyable part was meeting the customers"
bad,Company needs work. HHgregg does not compensate it employees.
bad,"I worked in the warehouse for this company, and never got anywhere. I would come in to work, the warehouse would be full of stock to be taken to the floor, and the stock team would be talking to the girls at the desk. Management favored people, and did NOTHING to people who needed to be fired. This company would always stick me working Sunday's after telling them several times that I attend church. This company still owes me holiday pay which I know I will never see. Do yourself a favor, and don't even bother applying to this job."
bad,"I thought this was supposed to be a family owned company, but I guess that doesn't matter. I helped open up a new store and they hired right around 50 sales associates. After only 1 year there are only 7 associate that were there when the store opened. They also try and trick you from the beginning with the amount of compensation that you can earn, and say goodbye to your life because you will be working 12 hours days for 25,000 per year. I would not wish this job on my worst enemy."
bad,"Not fun to work there, no sales, horrible commission rate cant live off this job."
bad,Wake up 3am to arrive at work by 5am get paper work for deliveries load the truck by 6am make sure paper work is in order for on time delivery be on the road all day until 7pm no life no fun just work.
bad,Poor business practices company wide. It was all about bean counters and employees were just another number to them. Management was terrible. I had 5 general managers in my time there
bad,I was a temporary employee for HHGregg while they were closing business.  I was an employee of HHGregg but my supervisor worked for the liquidation company.
bad,"HHGregg has recently closed down and I'm not sure why, but I'm sure it has to do with lack of company success and quality of merchandise. However, while employed there I thought it was okay for the time being... nothing I could see for myself long term."
bad,"Although I learned a lot and owe much of my sales expertise to HHGregg, the company has completely fallen from graces. Management lost sight of what the company needed to do to succeed, and that was focusing upon employees. When you cut back compensation, cut back hours, force working on holidays, cut holiday pay-- you alienate motivation from your staff, and you destroy the culture that could push a company through tough times. "
bad,"bad management,  warehouse is badly managed. nobody is on the same page . treat everybody like robots. was great place to work at "
bad,"The worst corporation to work for. Horrible compensation, management was horrendous. A bunch of liars and scam artist."
bad,"Not a lot to say, commission was low, hours could be arduous despite the store traffic being abysmal. The job has potential if you are a gung-ho company man without a family you care to spend time with."
bad,"long slow sales days during the week with more traffic coming on the weekend. "
bad,"I enjoyed my Job, but had poor/ unprofessional management. A typical day at work would be to follow a checklist, along with answering phones and checking customer's out of the store."
bad,"Upon being hired at hhgregg you will be uplifted with the seemingly wonderful notion that the harder you work the more you make. This ends up being a terrible fallacy, as time proves this is not the case. My position was a full time sales associate. I wouldn't consider myself the greatest salesman in the world by any means, but I was one of the most consistent in their store and had high survey scores from my customers. "
bad,"The management there was poor, the didn't stick to the layouts. The company doesn't care or work well with their employees. There's really no advancement."
bad,I thought my year experience was much of an humble one. The managers I worked with used very child like behavior and not at all straight forward with what needed to be done or what critiquing ideas they wanted to tell me.
bad,There is no work life balance and the management was more interested in partying and fraternizing with the female staff. This was not a good work place. Pay was not very good for the hours worked. Draw commission and working mandatory overtime with only 2 people in a department going into the holidays and no draw forgiveness. This company is also open on Thanksgiving day and works all night into black Friday. We didn't even get 8 hours between shifts.
bad,Company going down hill fast.  The corporaote office has been taken over by shareholders who only care about cutting cost by cutting pay.
bad,culture has changed commission structure has changed for the worse. was once a great company now it is a company that has no identity.
bad,The only time I recommend working for this company is during the holiday and tax season.  Once those specific seasons are over so is the traffic.  No traffic no potential sales which means you don't make any money.
bad,work week is five days working 9 hours with a fourced lunch. this typacly becomes 10 hours a day. Managment is to stretched to focuse on you. co-workers for the most part are good. the compatition for sales is deviding the sales staff. hardest part of this job is many hours standing!!  most enjoyable part is the customers.
bad,"Great place to work, not so much to build a carreer.I worked there for neqrly a year as a warehouse assoc. Management was great and workers were very kind and polite."
bad,"It is a good job for gaining some experience in sales, however it is not a position that should be held for an extended period of time. Compared to other sales positions this has to be the worst one. The company rarely advertises, which results in long days with few customers coming through depending on the store. The company is over-expanded and it needs to shutter some stores. Management is a joke, ""like really I don't know where they find these people."" I thought my managers were awkward, and lacked leadership characteristics. The company is based of an old business model, and I had customers ask me if it was the new Circuit City. I would only suggest this job as a last resort, but not to anyone with a college education."
bad,"everything was so unorganized i did not enjoy working there"
bad,This job is not for everyone.. commission based and very long hours.
bad,Great pay first year when economy was up. Second year the company began taking profit away from salesmen and by third year it was impossible to make any money.
bad,The company has very low integrity for its employees. Managers are whipped by their regionals who dont appreciate anything... who seem to forget what its like working in the actual store as a manager. Regionals are all up in lala land. They hire managers who dont have balls to tell their employees the truth. Dont ever believe them when they OFFER YOU A RAISE TO STAY. Dont waste your time for this company.
bad,"My overall experience was not positive, Initially brought in under a completely separate idea from what I experienced, wrought with people forced to undercut and compete with co-workers leading to work place drama, hostility, and correspondingly poor sales all due to the business model."
bad,"It was an okay place to work. I was only there for six months when the store I was working at closed down. The prices there were jacked up, and they tried to rip people off."
bad,Comapny had a bad habit of promising and not delivering.  Late Nov. early Dec.2016 told 88 store employees how well we were doing and by Mar 2017 closed these stores.  During the 5.5 years we had commission cuts and were expected more of.  Employment didn't end well.  I was very disappointed to say the least.
bad,"A position is sales is worthless, for there is hardly any traffic. Salesmen come and go nonstop. The training is awful. Management is probably the worst I've experienced--they each have opposing ideas, gossip all day, rarely offer help, insult their staff, sit around half the time doing nothing. It is honestly a horrible location and the company itself is most likely going out of business within the upcoming years."
bad,"The employees to them are just replaceable robots. There is no job culture. Everyone hated working there. The job was not bad, it was clean and safe."
bad,This is a good job for an after school job or a part-time job. If your good at sales you may be able to make it work for you. It's a place that really knows a lot about electronics.
bad,"I am the only fulltime person in the warehouse. Hours have been cut back and still management complains about not having shifts covered. Management expects one person to do the work of at least 2 or 3 people in one day. After working 2 of the 3 truck days alone, it takes a physical toll on the body."
bad,"pros: you learn alot and the discount is amazing"
bad,A regular work day consists of me checking price tags to make sure that they are correct with a current date. Cleaning appliances and making my section neat as possible. I am responsible for greeting customers and demonstrating the products that a perspective buyer is looking at and ringing the customer up.
bad,working at remote locations for the most part with minimal supervision.
bad,"Great, nice people to work with, too bad the company doesn't care that much about it's employees. Most of the management that they hire are ill equipped to perform their job. Along with constantly being understaffed, and not too concerned with hiring the appropriate amount of staff to run the stores smoothly."
bad,"I loved working with people and some colleagues I would consider friends, but management was always riding me about making more sales and when I had good sales, it was still not good enough. However,working on commission has its benefits if you are good at it, but stinks if you are not."
bad,i got treated wrong there I sold over one million a yr.top in th store three yrs. in a row i was let go for being retired said to me there is no part time salesmen here
bad,There are virtually no opportunities here. Since starting there not once was I ever encouraged or complimented but they did not hesitate to write me up and tell me everything I'm doing wrong. Most of management is semi laid back but the company believes that sitting down when doing long shifts with a bad back looks bad instead of there employees. Managers want almost nothing to do with working if they can help it and when faced with a customer almost force there way out of dealing with them. terrible work ethics all together
bad,"HHGregg provided little opportunity for either professional or personal growth. Although training was promised, none was ever provided. A typical day of work consisted of waiting around for someone to wander in the door in hopes of finding a deal. I learned that I am not the sort of individual who is willing to sacrifice my principles for a job working here. Management was barely adequate and was constantly being transferred from store to store, so little continuity in order was available since no SOP was ever implemented. My co-workers were, by and large, good men and women who were always on the lookout for a better job. The hardest part of my job was the fact that I sometimes worked 60 hour weeks and would be forced to take draw, which had to be paid back. My most enjoyable activities involved working with my customers, helping them find the right products, and educating them on the technology that we offered."
bad,"While I worked there it was fun, I had made a lot of friends. although the competitiveness was disheartening. It doesn't surprise me the company went bankrupt."
bad,"I was hired to help set up their new warehouse. Unfortunately, everyone was in their early to mid 20’s and a 41 year old woman didn’t fit into that. It also didn’t help that I wasn’t spanish"
bad,"Epic Mis-management on a corporate level resulted in collapse of company."
bad,The work day was always pretty easy. I enjoyed helping customers. management would not treat customers with respect and was not nice as I recall. Good for a student but there is no advancement career wise.
bad,"GOING OUT OF BUSINESS"
bad,Suffering from the woes of retail at the moment. Team did its best but upper management made unforgivable errors in judgement leading to catastrophic consequences.
bad,no one works are a team. no organization of personnel. no room for advancement. I learned that costomer service is the only way a business like that will survive.
bad,"When I was hired here the managers talked the place up for great earning POTENTIAL. The job is straight commission, no hourly base which is just crazy considering hardly nobody comes into the store. Average commission rate is only 1-2%. I could sell a 1,000 tv & only make 10.00 off of it if I'm lucky & if I sold the warranty that's maybe another 10.00. Accessories you only get about 1-7.00 also. Obviously I would try to up sell & push for warranties but still you have to sell a ton of products for you to even make any money & again it's hard to do because nobody comes into the store. I was working 40 hours a week & only bringing home 500-600.00 paychecks. & I was number 1 employee the 3 months I worked there, meaning my product sales & my warranty sales were the highest in my department. But that means nothing pay wise. Just means I was doing well at my job but getting nothing out of it. "
bad,"While working at HHGregg, we were working at 100% commission.  The store I worked at was taken over by management that showed way too much favoritism. Made it hard to get out of draw."
bad,"HUGE turnover rate in positions from a lowly hourly position all the way up to management provides no continuity in store proficiency and direction."
bad,"Commission vs draw is model for pay. The store changes pricing and cost at a near random basis making it difficult to sell margin items consistently. Management is overworked and under appreciated and not surprisingly moves on at a steady clip. Hours are not based on existing customer density so you often have an overstaffed store with more red shirts than customers. Sadly the nonproductive hours you work can drag you into the dreaded overtime draw and clocking out early is scowled upon even in an empty store."
bad,"Most of the time my day consists of putting together items for display around the store, helping customers carry their items to their vehicles and store maintenance. I just feel as though that some of my co-workers and managers don't have any respect for the people in the warehouse department."
bad,"If you are family oriented, hhgregg is not a good company to work for. Due to the gruesome work hours."
bad,"Good commission at times, mainly holidays.  Unreal amount of turnover within the company. Commission structure changes daily."
bad,"My first experience in consumer electronics. h.h.gregg was an okay job for a 19 year old starting college, and offered me a lot of skills in customer service, which I use everyday in my current job. However, the management at the time neglected customer issues and made my job incredibly stressful and difficult. They offer no advancement or raise opportunities. The salesmen would talk down to customer service employees. Made it a very uncomfortable work place. I would like to point out that this was then, and most of those people are gone now. I hold no grudge against this establishment."
bad,"I am a grown adult ,, i do no appreciate working with others who do not know how to handle themselves"
bad,"First, the management was very unprofessional. No one was on the same track. The pay can be good around holidays but if you are not in a busy area then you will now receive a good pay check. Saying this because it is a commission only job. If you are no an excellent sales person then do not waste your time. They do not provide the proper training necessary to become successful in a sales career. Some of the metrics are impossible to reach, depending on the location of the store. If you are in a less busy area then your day will consist of standing in one spot waiting for a customer, or cleaning things that are already clean. I did learn a little about being a salesman through my experience I had to learn on my own."
bad,delivered appliances throughout Ohio Kentucky and Indiana
bad,"100% commissioned base. The majority of Commission based on selling their Performance Guarantee (extended Warranty), Unfortunately they do not stand behind it. Customer Service after the sale is absolutely HORRIBLE! If you make Friends and Buddies with management you will succeed. The management takes care of their friends and hardly available to help."
bad,"Co-workers nice. Management needs to do a better job. Job not bad, made easier with co-workers. Management lies about things relating to the job. Cheap on raises. Mangement doesn't care about you at all. Makes fun of you behind your back. Everyone working there hates the place because of mangement."
bad,my coworkers were nice and friendly and hard workers but the management was poor and they showed poor unfair work practice . the best part of my day was dealing with customers and loved to be around my coworkers
bad,"You need to learn alot to work there about parts, things, tv, etc. everything in there you need to learn. The best part of the job is probably sitting on the computer."
bad,I enjoyed the adventure while it lasted.  It was a high pressure sales environment.  Under performers would steal sales just to hit numbers and not have to attend training classes.
bad,h.h.gregg had a good concept but was not as much in savings as they advertised. I made my largest commissions when i sold extended warranty plans. It seemed to be the only way to get a good commission and also was high pressure sales. that i did not like
bad,HH Greg closed down their stores a few years ago . There are no longer any more H.H Greg's open for business . I do believe that they are closed permanently
bad,I knew when younger son took over company that it was on the decline . I guess it was the writing on the wall..............................................
bad,"I personally had an interesting experience with this company. I worked for them for 3-4 years. There were certainly ups and downs. I enjoyed the work and the experience, just not the people running the show ."
bad,"No matter how well you did, experience you had, compliments you received from the customers or education level, if you are a person of color it is extremely difficult to move up in the company."
bad,"would have to stand and wait for customers to come in and help them with different products. pay was based off commission so it was very competitive, the store didn't have enough traffic which made it hard to really succeed. management at the store was great and helped me become very knowledgeable on the products tht i had to sell."
bad,It was a great experience to encounter great coworkers that truly appreciate your hard work and dedication for your team and motivating them when time where tough
bad,"Company struggled making earnings  and profits.  Poor practice of hiring former executives whose decision making took down the companies they had worked for.  Bonuses were top heavy and awarded monthly, quarterly, annually for second line management and up.  Sales staff commissions were deflated.  Hourly hours fluctuated.  Got away from what the company does best the selling  of appliances and electronics. Off the wall product lines introduced only to fail shortly after.  Upper management were like a school of carps. The long line of loyal customers made the day tolerable.  They had been with Hhgregg before they went public."
bad,Long hours Work all holidays most weekends Mangment can be irritating. Company stucture is flaud good peole work for the company. Benefits suck and the discount
bad,"I appreciate the opportunity to work with the company, but I learn a lot of do's and don'ts especially when it comes to how to treat the people who work for you ."
bad,"It was okay for a part time seasonal job. Was alot of confusion and cutting of hours. but, I enjoyed it while it lasted. I was happy to be employed and getting into the real world."
bad,"I was excited about getting the opportunity to work with a 100% commission based company. I soon learned that in the Atlanta market, Hhgregg is not busy on any level. You could tell it was hard for them to compete against such a high volume store like Best Buy."
bad,I take calls all day from unsatisfied customers. They are upset with their products or the bad service at the stores they shop at. It is my responsibility  to try and help each customer and resolve their issues. I also get calls to try and help to place online orders and track them as well. Most of my day is filled with handling complaints.
bad,Be careful with this company.  Training is outdated and does not even apply to the job.  A good example is that they train you on phones and they dont even carry them.
bad,"Pay is not competitive to other companies that hire the same work experience and knowledge level of sales reps. You will work hours that are hard to have a life around. "
bad,"You spend most of your day handling overrides and un-locking products. It seems that every transaction, from purchases to payments, require a manager to override the transaction."
bad,"Lack of flexibility, with little variation between days. Ultimately, the days, weeks, months and quarters resulted in 'chasing numbers' in order to achieve better pay. On the positive side, as a manager of a department, I was given the opportunity to recruit, build and coach my sales team, and was able to create my own destiny as a leader, resulting in a substantial bonus by the end of the calendar year."
bad,I see employees come and go all the time.  Typical big box retail.
bad,"I met some great people working for HHGREGG that made my job enjoyable every day, the potential of making money was always good as well, but working here gives you absolutely no work/ life balance, its HHGREGG or nothing. The management, at least at my store, was a joke. To hear managers gossip about other employees, customers, or other managers was very  alarming and unprofessional in my opinion. They (the managers) were very ""clique"" orientated, if you were in the clique you got, favorable hours, allowed to get by with not living up to work standards and actually having access to manager codes to override prices with manger approval. If you weren't in the clique they would try and make your work life miserable."
bad,"work environment is relatively slow and not a lot of work flow. other employees are great and have humorous personalities. but management is bad. they walk away when you need help or overrides, push angry customers in your face so you have to deal with them, and avoid helping customers and their headaches of situations/problems."
bad,"truck days are exciting"
bad,You could make a lot of money in this place but you have to break so many rules to do it that it's disgusting. Commission only brings out the worst in people as salesmen.
bad,"it had a nice atmosphere, i like the hours they gave me being a college student"
bad,"hhgregg is good about making money in a relatively comfortable working environment. However the management can be hostile and the compensation has been steadily reduced over the two years I worked there. Often times sales associates are chastised, and sometimes even cursed at by managers."
bad,"a typical work day consists of selling, cleaning and listening to managers bark out orders and complain."
bad,"Commission estimates were generated by landed cost on day of sale, then Commission Pay was calculated on landed cost at time of delivery, almost always adjusted down."
bad,"When i clock in at work I have many duties. I have to answer phones and assist customers with complaints, needs, questions,etc. I have to ring customers up that are paying cash, and usually it is a large amount that I am responsible for."
bad,"ok place to work is you are cutthroat , dont trust coworkers they are no friends in commission sales. Get in make money go home. no weekends off one sunday a month but no vacation allowed during holidays. fixed days off"
bad,When I did work for this company there was always a problem whether delivery or in store issue. I did my part as a manager and took care of customers to my best ability. I felt as though I was the GM and not a sales manager because of the lack of support. If the company was still around I wouldn't have stayed much longer.
bad,This company filed for bankruptcy in 2017. Not a very well run company from CEO on down. Obvious why this company could not stay competitive. HH Gregg did not know how to stay relevant and struggled with their identity. Became a discount store by their end.
bad,"Sales people would sell appliance packages that were paid for at time of sale. There would be sufficient inventory at warehouse, but not mrked as sold. If item(s) were sold afterward but delivered before yours, you would receive notification of non delivery on the day of delivery. You would have constant fires to put out, leaving less times to sell on floor."
bad,Started as a General Manager then became General Manager for new store openings. Lots of travel lots of stress which I don't mind but no one was on the same page in upper management.
bad,Okay company to work for but going out of business so that means finding another job did not have much time for my family so I missed out on alot of events but I did enjoy the tips and overtime that we had
bad,"Working here was a very nice experience until the very end. We were told that they would be closing down 88 stores that were in different states and were told that it would not affect our store. A couple weeks later we found out in an article online that the company had filed chapter 11 bankruptcy, we asked about it and were told we still didn't have anything to worry about. A couple days later all employees received letters in the mail about the bankruptcy so we asked again and were still told that we had nothing to worry about. A week later we were told that if we did not have a buyer by a certain dates then we would be shutting down for good."
bad,work elsewhere don't bother to apply unless its the holidays. Management was okay but the lack of consistency of corporate policies and procedures made it harder on associates
bad,Although I enjoyed most of my time with HH Gregg I was unable to stay at the job because they commission schedule kept lowering and sales expectations reached almost unattainable levels. there were also issues with the GM changing commissions to help the store numbers look better but taking away money from the employees. I believe that issue had been resolved since I left.
bad,"Long hours, poor commission rates, poor management, feels like the company is working against you, company will mess up something for the customer and you have to explain to them that there is no reason for the mistake, it just happened and there is nothing you can do about it. if someone orders a fridge, it gets sent from the distributing center to the delivery center then it gets delivered. frequently, the distributing center will not send the fridge to the delivery center. no one tells the customer that until the day of the delivery and then they get an automated message saying that the delivery date was changed, and they call you. you have no answer to give them and nine times out of then you lose the sale. I have lost hundreds of dollars due to issues like this that employees have no control over."
bad,"The environment is excellent. However, the fact that it is commission based is risky and not a good job for me due to the fact that I have a daughter and a disabled fiance to support."
bad,"Competitive environment that brings a challenge every day. If you are fine with working commission in a slow traffic environment this job would be perfect for you. You MUST capitalize on every customer you get otherwise you will not make any money,"
bad,"The company offers 100% commission positions, which a hardworking person can make decent money from. However, poor management and lack of interest from upper level corporate makes it a terrible working environment. Pay errors were not corrected. Hiring is not done well. Coworkers were overworked because of lack of proper staffing. Corporate is constantly adding job expectations, without allowing time to incorporate the new rules and requirements. There are limits on how paid vacation is taken (in term of increment requirements). There is no such thing as a sick day. Because clients have your personal mobile number, there is also no such thing as truly being ""off the clock"", as you can be reached at any time (including after hours and holidays)."
bad,Assist customers in systems for home entertainment and Demonstrations in oled and led and audio products and appliances. Responsible for managing daily sales and trained new employees in consumer electronics. Working with hhgregg for five yrs has given me more experience in marketing and sales to make me an asset to my next employer and  future endeavors as a business owner. The hardest part of the job is not having the traffic we once had during our first yrs of opening due to less advertising and internet priceing . The best part of the job was traveling across the us to grand opening stores to sell and teach others the sale process and winning awads for the past five years.
bad,"A typical day at work is looking at my open order report to track customers that have not received their product due to products being out of stock. Once I find out who has not received their product I will call the manufacture and give purchase orders to find out an ETA."
bad,The hardest part of this job is that there are some days where there are no customers coming in (depending on location) which means little to no commission on those days. Other days when its busy (around holidays usually) one can make hundreds of dollars in one day.
bad,"The expectations were high and presented in a way that made it sound like the earning potential was through the roof, when in reality, it was harder in the off season."
bad,Company seems to have lost sight on its core business. Very little training and support at store level to implement changes and business streams. Relies on commissioned sales associate to act as labor for projects without compensation.
bad,H.H.Gregg is fun to work for and the opportunity to make money in sales is good but there is no room or chance for a promotion. With the special sales they are always running it is impossible to balance a personal life with the hours they expect you to work. On several occasions you are expected to work from 8 Am to 10 PM. On black Friday you can expect to work 28 hours strait which is unhealthy and dangerous. On top of everything the managers know you are expendable and treat you as such. If at all possible avoid this employer unless you are desperate and all you know is commission sales.
bad,Management only cared about their bonus checks. not enough compensation for the hours had to put in.
bad,"A typical day at HHgregg is standing around waiting for customers to come in for services most days as little as one customer per-hr "
bad,"Customer Service Management; Maintain Inventory analysis and loss prevention; work place was constantly changing, but plenty of online training. The hardest part of the job was fixing associate errors with tickets sales and deliveries."
bad,"Basic job the job was really about the people you work with rather than the people you work for. Commissions switched based on the need of the company, in no way benefitting the sales reps."
bad,This particular location seemed to care very little about the hard work of their employees and more about the money that employees brought in. The shift management made overall views of the company look bad.
bad,Management on a store level was very good but the higher you went up it seemed the less brain cells said person had to create cognitive thought . Money was good at first but alot of very bad decisions were made and inventory levels became very scarce wich made it impossible to make any money on a commissioned based pay scale.
bad,"This review is centered around an individual who worked at the corporate offices."
bad,"HHgregg was a great company before they went public. I understand you have to expand your brand, but never forget who and what got you there."
bad,"Commisson jobs and hard, very competetive, and cuthroat. It's not for everyone but it \does test your skills which I liked."
bad,"If you enjoy working for 100% commission and working with manipulative co-workers, then this is the job for you. There is a fine line between competitive and whatever happens at HH Gregg. The management was no help whatsoever and the employees with stab you in the back when you turn around."
bad,"I started  there from an  very optimistic vantage point, but quickly was taught the H.H.Gregg in Chattanooga,Tn's philosophy in loving what you do.""who cares"" is the message that I just couldn't comprehend. Which ultimately lead to my departure .That is my review"
bad,"The company started great with a lot of room for advancement. Then they took away certain positions. They promised things and did not follow through. A lot of really good people left the company due to false promises and being treated badly. The CEO of the company even left, his granfdather started the company."
bad,"HHGREGG is a down to earth place to work for, it is simple and easy. The management at my store isnt the best and could use ALOT of work but over all it is tolerable."
bad,"Warehouse: Pull purchased items from warehouse from a small T.V to a french door refrigerator and load it into a customers car."
bad,a lil stressfull you have to run behind each person who comes in the store and then you must make sure the delivery guys do their job if not you will not get paid.
bad,hhgregg was the best and have the best team of people but the pay isnt the exact best.
bad,Working in and supervising a commission-based payed staff proved difficult as the company changed the commission structure several times as the company began to decline.
bad,"Learned a lot, met some amazing people, learning communication and sales skills. The pay wasn't worth it. There were a number of reasons why HH Gregg went under:"
bad,"Started out pretty good. This company is going down hill.  Currently in the process of closing my store down.  Commission is not good, but there is potential to make money."
bad,"Very friendly environment,nice coworkers nice customers.Daily working with people. Occasionally challenged by difficult customers but always manageable."
bad,The company itself was once a desirable place to work for any sales personal who had the ability to build and sustain client relationships. The pay was well and the hours fair but has since changed to a poor pay plan and undesirable work hour. Most of the current employees in the sale department are unsatisfied with the current pay scale.
bad,"Did  not really like the store environment, all my co workers were not friendly and the store had no customers to service when you're being paid commission"
bad,"stressful work environment, company standards are not upheld at store level, no organization at store level"
bad,"Tried to many things to make money , when the should of stuck to what they knew. They went of business because of it. Tried to make to many changes and did not pay the associates for the amount of work they did."
bad,made some great friends there and learned alot about tvs and appliances but the pay was awful made 8.25 for the whole two years i was there. hours sucked didn't want you to work no more then 35 hours got mad at you when you wanted overtime.
bad,"enjoyed my coworkers, typical day is  responding to emails from stores, manufacturers or warranty company. answering phone calls from stores or customers"
bad,Its an ok place to work. It has the typical ups and downs of any job. However with hard work you are able to advance with the proper support.
bad,"Not a bad place, but the start up in a pure commission environment is BRUTAL... not a great place if you need a kick start to get on your feet"
bad,"Meet and Greet was the only way to make money and you absolutely had to up-sell them or you would not make any money. Commission only on a draw so if you did not meet their quota they paid you what their quota is and then the next pay when you made more, they took money from you. you may not even make minimum wage if you are not a good salesperson. I did not have to worry about this but many people have. plus you would work 12-14 hour days with 1 day off and your quota would raise making it harder to reach."
bad,"HHGregg has given me the opportunity to grow as a person and as a leader. Everyday I come in take care of all customer service related issues. The management in the store is easy to get along with and know what they are doing. The other employees in the building are great, they all have great personalities and are fun to be around. The most difficult thing about this job was probably just not being to help everybody that came through the door do to some circumstance or another. Overall I have really enjoyed the time I have spent at this company and the people that I have spent it with."
bad,This is a great company to be employed with I have learned a vast amount of skills that can help me advance in my career.
bad,"Hired in as warehouse lead after 6 weeks I was promoted to Operations where I had to travel for training which was not substantial enough to reflect the duties, did not receive pay increase or traveling reimbursement until after I resigned. The day I resigned I went in to talk with the manager for 2 hours and he never showed, The manager has no clue on how to perform the day to day operations and solely depends on me and a manager of another department. When asked to help a customer who is wanting the  Store Manager his reply is ""it is not my job to listen to these people"". This is the worst Manager I have ever met and he seems like a guy acting in a training video of ""how not to be a manager"". The manager would constantly belittle the sales staff, wage employees, and completely undermine all other managers."
bad,Worked with this company for 3 or more years and was laid off. Managers didn't know employees were side wiped by this as well. Total loss to so many families including my own.
bad,Lack of leadership.. It was a job where there was poor leadership and no real direction from day to day..  I was more so on the delivery and setup side of it but had to figure it out on our own
bad,"HHGregg is currently out of business, so this review is pointless. while there though, i was able to quickly advance to a higher position. it was in a good location."
bad,This company is now out of business because of growing too rapidly. Not a family friendly employer. I was always being scheduled for minimum of 9 to 12 hours a day and was driving over an hour one way with having a toddler at home.
bad,The company wasn't a very good one. While it loved the customer it didn't care about the employee. There is a very good reason the company went bankrupt.
bad,"You would typically work 12+ hours a day. You would also work 6 days a week. Pay was not fair, for the hours and time you would put in. They didn't care to have a life/work balance"
bad,"Pretty standard big box working experience. Not a lot of team building. Very top down. Family owned and run. Semi-corporate, many times to comic effect."
bad,long and dragging ups and downs. never know what type of day you're going to get. learn a lot about televisions appliances and selling needs
bad,management was good long hours not so good pay co worker are great short meetings must sell not to get into draw draw is the worst . no life will be in the store all day .
bad,Bad company practices. Culture has changed a lot in the past few years and it feels more and more like the salesmen are being set up to fail.
bad,"I worked 13 years as an Operations Manager, was injured"
bad,"A poor lack of vision, an Indianapolis based company that opened way too many stores between 2010 and 2014. Never found their niche. Grabbed at anything to throw against the wall to see what stuck..appliances...electronics (poor selection) furniture."
bad,Great work environment but it is commissioned based and the commission tears are not very good. Commission drops heavily for every discount even corporate mandated sales.
bad,"A typical day at hhgregg was very laid back. There weren't many costumers coming in. Outside management was bad. The salesmen had a hard time selling products, because the stocks were always low. This was the hardest part of the job. The job wasn't all bad, the workplace was very welcoming and family like. I learned people skills and art of persuasion."
bad,As a CSM you focused on assisting customer with any issues of their product. The atmosphere was mainly geared towards the sales associates. Cannot Pursue career due to the stores closing.
good,You can make money around holidays but the long hours and managment selfishness makes a terrible job. They do not care about you!
good,if u really need a job its a good place to work for there are more cons then pros under the table pay tips are good long days all damages to home onwer comes out of your pocket just not a good job to work for
good,I can only say that management needs better training in the stores and at the distribution centers. So much more to learn
good,"A typical day at work was fairly busy and non-stop. The company structure did not provide the store that I worked at any available hours for staffing so the employees are extremely overworked and highly underpaid ($8-10 max hourly, even for the assistant store manager position). One position may be doing duties of several others. Management was some of the worst I've ever seen. They are young and inexperienced and taking staffing directions from a much older, angry-with-life and extremely lazy department lead. They have since ""run-off"" every other leadership position including long-time employees in the store creating a dysfunctional hierarchy. The end result was an unnecessarily hostile work environment that quickly grew into a major displeasure to go to everyday."
good,"No advancement, no balance between work and family life, poor compensation, poor management"
good,Hhgregg was an okay job unfortunately the company no longer exist but toward the end I had to put in my 2 weeks because I had a family emergency and my manager didn’t want tote me attend to it.
good,This company is a slow past retailer the has higher than average pricing and straight commission pay. This is a relatively young company that has a lot of room to grow.
good,very stressful workplace . in the homestead store it is very diffcult to sale when there is almost no one that comes in to buy
good,Manager depending on the day and how they felt is what depend on how the shift is going to be. Manager wasn't all on the same page as far as running the store
good,The most stressful two years of my life. Working there did help me become a better problem solver though and helped me to deal with stressful situations. I wouldn't go back though.
good,"They recruited me from another company in January 2017,I awas with my previous company for 5 years ,the first time they made me an offer I refused,one reason the money wasn't right, the second offer was better ,who knew the company was going bankrupt in April 2017."
good,"Being an honest, Forward female for this company is hard. Starting in sales, their practices are unfair."
good,A typical day at HHGregg is busy. The store is known for the great deals on televisions and also shopping for home quality appliances with top brands giving you the lowest prices.
good,"Management is inexperienced, they may understand the company but have zero to little skills in dealing with employees/customers.  Straight commission job which can be extremely low paying in the summer months. No training in product. Holiday hours exceedingly long.  Balance of work and home life is nearly non existent. Culture encourages overly aggressiveness in sales people. Commission rates extremely low."
good,HH Gregg was micromanaged by incompetent individuals. They refused to acknowledge changes in the retail industry. They were ambivalent to employee input.
good,HHGREGG is now Out of business. we all worked on commission you don't sell you don't make money. electronics was not a great things to tell. kitchen product was the best thing to sell out of the entire store
good,Did not give true answers leading up to going out of business causing many employees to not have enough time to acquire new employment what a messed up corporation
good,i was traveling back and forth from west Ga. and Atlanta everyday. So i was on time majority of the times. The management wasn't organized all. The shifts weren't accurate either.
good,"The position could get stressful as the associates were micro managed depending on the manager. the company has little respect for family life, and responsibility."
good,"HHGREGG is a experience. Great people, the management is IFY and the road to management is extremely backwards. Once coming aboard it sell or yo won't make it. I was sent to different locations in different states to sell. After selling I was in the OPS phase but was being held back due to other stores needing help and coverage. All in  the process I witness a huge amount of managers, and associates quitting. But once I got placed in my store I felt that I was just thrown into a store without proper training to deal with they're horrible systems to deal with angry customers. I remained positive through it all and I will still recommend anyone to work there. Just know you will have to move when they want you to. If you don't then they will say your not ready. Enjoy your experience as I did. Its not all golden but its a JOB."
good,It was a really good job until new management came in and changed all of the work ethics which made the evening crew work 12+ hours 5 days a week. And shifted all of the job positions around.
good,no paid training which is horrible because there is alot of it. theres good management and bad management in this company and they move stores alot so your work atmosphere and store demeanor changes often. alot of ups and downs.
good,great place but low traffic. management is mean sometimes but thats every job
good,Interacting with different people every day and getting to learn about technology
good,"On a typical week day I probably get to help 8-10 customers. I average probably $100 a day during the week, and probably $150-$200 on a sat/sun."
good,A typical day at work most of the time is serving customers. I have learned the system and I know everything beacuse I have been there since day one. The management is not the type of management that will have your back in any situation and they change management alot. I love all my coworkers like family. The hardest part of the job is having to go in there everyday knowing that my hours been cut down and I have been there since day one. I love the job because it is laid back and I can listen to music and I love helping customers.
good,"When it is busy it is good, When it is slow you dont make any money"
good,Some of the most fun ive ever had at work. Great sales people to learn from and always a good place to have a laugh.  Upler management  constantly changes the commission plan to their benefit so you can never make any real money
good,"It was an ok place to work, but it wasn't too interesting because it's all based on commission. It doesn't really have goodles benefit. If you don't sale, you have any money."
good,The job is full commission. Hard to make a steady decent paycheck. Management cares more about selling extended warrantys then anything else.
good,I love meeting the different customers that would come in and enjoyed talking with them and helping them with their selection.  They would never have warehouse to roll out heavy appliances or tv so sales people would have to do it instead of selling.  There was never enough hours for a customer service rep either so sales asst would have to answer all phone calls and handle customer issues due to management not wanting to get on the phone.
good,"I have worked for this company for the entire time that the Chicago market has been open. I have seen multiple changes in management at store and regional levels. I've seen changes in policies that affected everyone and only certain groups. But the one thing that is consistent. You basically sacrifice your outside life for this company. The only people in a store that might have the luxury of an outside life are those in entry level hourly positions. Everyone else is essentially ""on-call"" at all times. I've even asked my current manager what would happen if someone says they couldn't work a shift on short notice due to other existing plans, would that be held against them. He gave me a coy smile and said ""probably""."
good,The rest of the employees are really unprofessional and handle the products without care. My warehouse manager drove a hand truck in a 3k dollar TV and I would get in trouble for taking good care of products. I'm thankful I don't have to work there. Would not recommend purchasing products there.
good,"I work in the warehouse and while the job isn't overly complicated, it can become tiring. I enjoy most of my coworkers and the managerial staff is very understanding and will work with you on almost anything. The only shortcoming here is the corporate side, they don't seem to care about the quality of products or how business is handled as long as it doesn't cost a lot to maintain it and that bothers me."
good,"Work days went fast, I learned so much about the company and also liked the people I worked with. The thing that HHGregg lacked most was management. They constantly refused to help customers with their problems."
good,"No longer the ""new kid on the block,"" I've seen customer traffic decline to almost non-existent,even on weekends-Yet the floor is over crowded with sales people.This is not a good environment to work in because it's very tough to make money,and the sales people become ruthless,and do things they normally wouldn't do,because they become desperate and need to make more money."
good,Learn new Product and clean. help every customer that walks in the door until they leave out of the building. This is HHgregg moto.
good,Supportive managment. High quality merch. Hours vary dpendin on season. Holidays give best chance for higher earnings
good,Was a great job.  Only down fall was that you worked a minimum 47 plus hours a week and weekends were a must work to make sure that you didn't go into draw on a pay check usually.  At my particular store the sales associates were awesome to work with and talk too.  Our manager on the other hand definitely was on a power trip and all the sales associates really disliked their job just because of him.
good,"Imagine the work- life of a car salesman but instead of automobiles, it's electronics and appliances. Plus  instead of closing up shop by 7:00-8:00, it's more like 9:00-12:00... and you HAVE to work at least one 12 hr shift every week. That's life at HHGREGG. "
good,"A difficult job in a lot of ways, the job and responsibilities that accompany it were not difficult as they were mostly clerical. However dealing with customers is always a problem. People will always equate the person behind the register as the representative of the company. In other words when they have issue with a product that purchased it is your fault. The managers at the location i worked at were difficult because there were so many and none seemed to be on the same que. As far as the coworkers they were fun people to hang out with and decent at their jobs. The best part of the job would have to have been talking to the different vendors and getting ideas on different products to be released."
good,"This particular HHgregg was just opening up so I help set up the whole store with everything. Such as TV's, Washer & Dryers, Cameras, and more."
good,I started with the company on the East Coast and was successful in sales in both home theater and appliance. I relocated to the Midwest and the company culture was completely different. I no longer had the autonomy to make a deal happen. I had more experience and product knowledge than anyone above me. The lack of commitment to the store and customers really hurt the expanding market and ultimately made my decision to vacate my position much easier than it should have been considering how dedicated to the company I had been just 6 months prior.
good,"Typically a day at work consists or standing for long periods of time while phones can ring uncontrollably and customers are in line. While this is going on some other employees and managers are either talking to each other or playing on their phones. SOme associates and managers go on constant smoke breaks throughout the day but if customer service leaves the station to use the restroom, we are automatically paged to help a customer instead of a manager or another employee asking what the customer needs. Some associates refuse to help customers on the phone and there is constant nagging on the sales floor about comission. The general manager is also very pushy about making sales of cell phones and other merchandise when my position is not n sales. I would have joined the sales staff if I wanted to sell products."
good,fun place to work and great people to work with somtimes product was out of stock or customers were not home in their time line
good,Used to have good leadership and pay until they went public.
good,I enjoyed my experience at hh Gregg. The location that I worked at did a good business until we started running into inventory issues. The company was going out of business so I accepted another job offer just prior to its closing.
good,too bad the store closed.   I was just getting the hang of my job when the store closed...It gave me good experience on redirecting calls and/or answering customers' questions.
good,"I worked at the headquarters in Indianapolis, IN. By the time I started working the company had lost most of the work life benefits and was on a decline. I heard that before it turned corporate it cared about the employees and the customers. It's sad when all you care about is your bottom line that mindset transforms the company. Lead by example if you want to stay in business worry about: your employees (they interact with the customers/ if they aren't happy it shows in their service), your customers, and the quality of your product/service."
good,The commissions in this job are great when they are busy. Once things slow up they really slow up. when you are sales associate your main duties are selling appliances and greeting customers. The customers are easily annoyed because you have to greet them as soon as they walk in. So you have show your true sales skills and charm
good,"A typical day at work would involve unloading trucks, cleaning restrooms, putting items on display, and help customers put their items into their cars. The management at times was careless and didn't seem to want to help the employees."
good,A typical day at hh gregg warehouse would be off loading a trailer full of appliances and furniture  by hand with no help. Sometimes i have ten trailers todo for so little money.
good,"Commission Sales experience. Provided professional electronics advice and services to customers. Find solutions to the customers needs and provide professional consultation. Educate customers about the products, and sell them the best product for their needs. Installation services of electronics and appliances."
good,"All of the hhgregg stores are closing on may 24 2017 ."
good,Hhgreg is a laid back Job. Not hectic hours and doesn't require much experience. It's definitely a place where you can get started with a solid foundation. You move and stage many heavy households appliances .
good,Good people and Good atmosphere. Not flexible hours with  Barebones staff.  If anyone is sick or goes on vacation entire system collapses and cause huge headaches.
good,Thers just a few things i would change if i could if i was still there. For example the way workers would treat ther comsters and the the level of disapline that the management tought some of ther workers. It was just to much drama ther to call it a completely comfortable work place.
good,Paycheck are unsteady due to commissions. Was a fun job but not a career. Sales goals that are unattainable in a cutthroat commission sales environment.
good,Cleaning and dusting unloading trucks and taking items out to customers cars. I learned to work by my self on many things and had to come up with some new ways to help my self to get that job done. Co-workers are nice and helpful. Hardest thing is seems that I have lots work and on some days I had have an discussion with myself that should I take a lunch or not. overtime during the holidays but the rest of time overtime is strictly controlled.
good,"Very long hours.  No support or training from management.  Straight commission, which  was great during holidays, sucked during slow times."
good,"It was pretty slow there, and they only did commission. There was no base pay. More often than not, the associates would wind up in draw due to lack of customers."
good,"Part time long hours. Not enough time for breaks."
good,"If you can hustle people and get them to buy the PSP you may actually make some decent money here."
good,Growing Company....room for advancement but not very quickly
good,"I started in an unfortunate location with, new management. Had very poor training, luckily co-workers who each had there own area of knowledge where happy to share. Currently, new new management has started which seems to be improving store. The main issues faced where getting out of draw which was caused by ridiculous overtime pay. So you get time and a half 60 hours if you go over 40 at all. Meaning you have to had sold the amount paid or you will owe a hhgregg money next time. If you stay owing money you will be fired."
good,Sales is the only driven factor to generate compensation through hard work.
good,This location was the delivery center for the stores. We had to managed incoming and outgoing trucks. Track customer deliveries and handle any customer service issues. Management was lack luster except for a select few. I loved the people I worked with but there were certain supervisors that were intimidated by new comers who wanted more.
good,A company with great balance sheet at the cost of all employees. Extremely bad quality of life and work life balance. If you can sacrifice a normal life this is a great company to work for to gain experience. Outdated business model and unproductive schedule hinder growth.
good,knowledgeable associate
good,"A typical day at work for myself at hhgregg can be exciting, but very stressful. Im always learning something new weather it has to do with sales pitches, computers, newer technology, but the management needs to be picked up a lot of them do not know what they are doing half the time and im teaching them. Co-workers are very competative which i love, it drives me to try harder to overachiev thier goals. What i do love about my job the most is the interactions of the customers after im able to chat with them and take care of them making sure they get exactly what they need."
good,Seeing as how the CEOs took money in the stock market and cause the company to go bankrupt it shows just how the management was. They started early days were very long work was very hard there was no real management or sense of security or health care if you hurt yourself it was on to you if you damage something in someone's house it was on you if anything was damaged during even a product was scratched it was on you unless you notified the warehouse before you even left the building
good,"Discounts were great, store managers were great. Regional manager was awful. Long hours 100% commission pay, by the end very low pay. Good people to work with mostly"
good,"Commission sales were stressful,. I did not like commission sales...it was total commission salary, hard work and delivery problems. TRUCK ISSUES...GPS issues."
good,"the job wasn't bad and the business was pretty good and steady paced for the most part, but management just didn't care at all about it employees, only makes sales"
good,It was a great way to learn/hone selling and customer service skills. It allowed me to grow exponentially on these levels and learn to feel people out and resolve issues.
good,"management wasn't very good, low pay,  unhappy environment. Worked with nice people and had flex time. At my position, I heard and saw information others didn't, and I didn't agree with how some things were ran."
good,My Store varied from okay to great depending on who was store manager.  Two out of the three I worked under were great one was inexperienced but did grow.  Upper management (corporate level) was vary erratic.
good,"The company is a good company, it was just run wrong, nothing to the current figureheads but some decisions should have been done properly. Upper corp should listen to lower levels about how to make the company better, sadly... it is now in liquidation and going out of business."
good,Unloading merchandise off trucks as it would come in. Putting away in proper place in warehouse. Assisting customers getting merchandise to their vehicles.
good,"I loved the job, but the commission rates weren't worth the time and effort. $2 commission on a $1000 laptop is a bit ridiculous"
good,"If you like being duped into believing that you're making a living, this is the position for you.  Be prepared for no consideration of your life outside of work, ridiculously planned trainings (745am on a Sunday and then work), and paying to work there.  Yes, paying to work there. From your work shirts to not making any sales to losing money when they're running coupons you're constantly taking a hit. Lack of volume at this location does nothing to boost employee morale in conjunction with the condescending tone throughout management.  The only highlight is the people outside of management - at least until they leave. Overall, you need a steady job to support this habit."
good,I only worked here for a short time but the time that I did spend was okay. The managers were good and willing to help you make a sale and they were very knowledgeable of the products that were in the store. I only left because the job was either 90%-100% commission based I can't remember for sure which one.
good,"It is challenging but once you get the hang of it you can make some serious money. You do have to work a whole lot though. No part time when I was there. Some of the people are hard to work with and will try and take your sales. That part was really annoying,"
good,The job was based solely on commission which made the environment stressful. Other employees would steal your customers and management wouldn't do anything about it. Long hours with no guarantee of any pay because if you didn't sell anything you didn't make any money.
good,"A days work at HH Gregg is typically very busy and hands on. First thing in the morning Icount all the cash and deposits, print lots of reports that I have to examine and get information from them that I will need throughout the day while handling inventory and cash. I normally do inventory daily on different items. Then handle any variances, this helps to avoid future issues with inventory. I have to get any transfers ready that may be going out for the day. I have to assure the warehouse employees are doing there job and keeping the warehouse organized, also I monitor all retruns and exchanges. I have learned how to really muli-task, and keep calm when dealing with angry customers. The management at this location has a very high turnover, and the managers are not very dependable, and do not work as a team, this makes work difficult for everyone else. There is nothing really hard about the day, just have to stay busy so I can get all my work done, and the part I enjoy the most is making an angry customer's day, and at the end of the day when I can look back and see what all I have got accomplished!"
good,"My day to day was always busy with tasks. Always busy and working on the next goal and or project to maintain productivity and rise to each new challenge as it was afforded me."
good,"During peak seasons which typically are around christmas and black friday, you could potentially make a lot of money. However, after you make a lot of sales, you can be sure there will be some returns. Said returns come out of your next paycheck and if you do not sell enough of your goal, you will end up in draw."
good,"but not very family friendly,  they don't mind forcing lots of extra hours on you during the holidays just in case a customer comes in."
good,"Replenishing stores orders followed by stocking and, cleanup. The only thing I've learned differently from my previous warehouse experience is how to use a scan gun. The management here is some what lacking, relying on employees to step up to fill in the gaps. Employee turn over is very high. First retail experience so, I can't really think of anything enjoyable about the job. There are a lot a peaks and, valleys. Hours can be lean in between holidays."
good,Working in the ware house basically involved loading up customers product into their cars and unloading the trucks. there where a few other  little things but when neither of those two jobs need to be done there wasn't much work. It was a struggle just to stay busy.
good,"To start, this is a commission ONLY big box sales store. The policy is to be the most personal shopping experience. To accomplish this the staffing is a small group who has extensive ""training"" throughout the year. This is both bad and good, firstly these two factors lead to unnecessarily long hours especially around the holidays. So if you have small children or are particular about any holiday, this job is NOT for you. The primary ""training"" strategy is in the form of walkthroughs, videos and pop quiz type tests done on a pc. Though this sounds good most (not all) of the managers know nothing about the products they're training you on...NOTHING! Now the good, the smaller environment means you really get to know your co-workers which can be a real benefit when you need help (SN: your peers will become your best source of assistance and information). The store has built a bad reputation for being a big discount big box bargain. This can be an issue with customers because the y expect a big deal, even though there is no longer room for it. On the flip side of that (with management's permission) some of the deals you strike can build great repeat business."
good,"A typical day at work for me would include doing ""roll outs"" for customers. Cleaning the floors and wiping the walls for any stains that may occur on them. Cleaning the toilets and urinals. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with people who talk to me any kind of way. The most enjoyable part is clocking out."
good,Its commision based so there is an ample opportunity to make money. The company advertises fairly well and gets decent customer flow. The work itself isnt hard but the amount of hours required especially during the holiday season can be a bit much.
good,The employees are highly friendly and all about customer service. The store I worked at liked to have fun and show off the products sold at the store to all customers.
good,"Very busy,fast paced, growing rapidly, and never a dull moment."
good,The company over all isn't bad but management needs to value their employees better. This is why they have a high turn over rate. If not for the customers showing their appreciation for the customer service that the employees give in my opinion the work atmosphere would be down.
good,"unload truck, assist guests with product, maintain safe warehouse."
good,Pay for delivery drivers was good until it got contracted out.
good,So many tv's
good,A pretty good place to work but compensation isn't great and having a revolving door of managers
good,It was a great company to work for even though it was a full commission job so you had to be on your toes at all times. There were obviously some issues that caused the company to close all locations.
good,"Sales was poor, customers service was strong and managers had your back when need be. I believe too many discounts were given causing business to go under, delivery teams assigned to area were poor and it was hard to get teams to stay."
good,"Assessed and met needs of variety of customers in order to match them to optimal products. Achieved over $800,000 in annual sales consecutively from 2009-2010"
good,"you get commission pay. "
good,"The only problem with this job was the lack of pay. It was a commission job and sometimes I would have to wait hours just to talk to a customer. Although I was a good salesman , the lack of customer traffic affected paychecks. It is currently out of business"
good,"My responsibilities/duties were not at all to blame for my low star review. Management wasn't the worst I've ever experienced, but it definitely could've been better. At times it felt as if the manager on duty was non existent because they would disappear to the back or to another part of the store for hours, leaving employees and customers to their own devices. This may not sound too bad, but with a short staffed store, I feel it is important for the manager to make themselves more available to his/her employees and customers. It was such a recurrence that all the employees got used to not having a manager around and looked to a fellow employee for assistance who was quite knowledgeable."
good,"Bad management, bad middle management, bad upper management. No accountability due to bad management.Do a great job and you will bare the brunt of the work, do the minimal and you will be left along."
good,HHGREGG was a great environment to be in if you enjoy cut throat sales. Management was constantly changing and I could not get a sense of direction for the store. My paychecks were what compensated for the lack of structure.
good,"As a whole, working with Hhgregg has taught me 1 thing"
good,"During tenure, maintained staff - screening, interviewing, hiring and training. Gained a lot of valuable information about merchandising, marketing and retail operations."
good,Though this was family for many years it is now going out of business.I will greatly miss the people I worked with all these years.  I will look back on this work experience fondly.
good,"I've worked for this company for almost twenty years and they have recently field bankruptcy and are about to go out of business and close. As an employee, we have had to get the majority of the events from the media and not internally.  That is the worst."
good,the company has declared bankruptcy.  After April 9th 88 stores will be totally closed down  and empty.  absolutely everything will be sold off even the displays.. ......................................................./.......................................everyone at hhgregg interacts well with each other.  the staff is small but very creative when it come to interacting with the customer.
good,"My daily duties included inventory control, balancing the safe, merchandising, helping salespeople close sales, training, price adjustments, sales tracking along with hitting daily goals."
good,Extremely high turn-around of associates and managers to the point where everyone become very confused. Very high pressure sales environment with 100% commission.
good,"While the work was usually fun and enjoyable, it would have helped, especially in a commission based workplace to have the company help employees more. (i.e. advertising, marketing, etc.)"
good,"While working at Hhgregg I learned a lot, as far as communication with my customers. The management was very rude, hard to work in those surroundings."
good,"Great job for a motivated relationship selling professional, commission only with little room for advancement. Co workers make or break the experience, motivated co workers help build the environment."
good,"hhgregg has great vales and a great growth strategy. With the right leadership, this company could grow from a regional player to a nationwide chain. Management here is very involving an hands on. For someone new to management, this experience is second to none."
good,"Great workplace, absolutely love my job. They need to better evaluate their workers because they have done a poor job in hiring good workers."
good,They have always been understaffed and most of slack is picked up by the hourly associates. Days are always very busy. Most of the managers were great as well as most of the other associates.
good,not a bad place to work but it has its highs and low on your pay check especially depending on the time of year. In the summer you may starve but the holidays are always great to you
good,"Company has no regard for family."
good,"This employer pays strictly commission for all salespersons with the exception of sales lead which make a very small hourly rate with too many management responsibilities keeping them away from the sales floor.  They over-staff the sales floor and under-staff the support employees, i.e salesmen must sell and then pull the merchandise from the back room and arrange furniture and shelves.  Company pushes the sale of warranty excessively and offers few incentives for salesmen.  from 8-22% depending on sales.  Not a reliable job."
good,Its an Ok place to work if you have a strong background in sales. Paycheck will go up and down as demand for products in the store does too.
good,"Very on hands management style with sales staff. Involved with every aspect of store sales, operations and deliveries."
good,Typical retail job the biggest problem was taking calls from customers who had delivery issues and their not being a manager available to handle the call. There was a lot of delivery issues but that was years ago not sure how it is now. Compensation was pretty fair and my manager was very nice and supportive.
good,Let me start by saying its a great place to shop! As for working. You are not and never will get paid for what is expected of you without being a shady sales rep. Its to hard for the amount of floor management to do their jobs and watch the bad employees at the same time. You have to buy your own uniform and they fade which will require you to buy more the next year.
good,"Was a good place , but had way too many employees on commission only. No chance to make a good living. Management was nice and knowledgeable but, only did what was told from higher upper management."
good,"A typical work day included cleaning the store, restocking, organizing the products and loading and unloading for customers."
good,"Honestly, management was terrible and extremely pushy, I could not imagine this being a career move. However, if you're just looking for a paycheck, it's alright. It's a job that you don't need to care about, I never once had to think  about it outside of work and was in a drunken stupor half the mornings that I walked in. Working there is basically like being a server at a restaurant."
good,Not really happy with my current job. I like the atmosphere and the people I work with but over all I want to be in a field that helps me grow.
good,The typical life of a warehouse employee at Hhgregg can be summarized as the guys who get everything in the store done. 
good,"Our typical workday began with the morning briefing, followed by the previous days numbers. Throughout the day, we would engage customers to assist them find the product most likely to fit their needs. The hardest part of the job, were the days when sales were slow. The most enjoyable part was getting a big sale and knowing that the customer was pleased with their product."
good,HHgregg was a great company to work for but get used to spending a lot of time at work.. as a retail manager you work 60-70 hours on regular months.. and when the holidays come through just kiss your family goodbye!
good,Learned a lot while I worked for hhgregg. Met great people both co-workers & customers alike.There was nothing I couldn't handle on this job.
good,It is a ok company to work for. The only thing about HHGEGG is that they will not work with you on going back to school and there work hours.
good,if you like minimum wage then its a good place to be. Not a good place to try to make a living to start a family.
good,Wtih top-notch training and great co-worker HH Gregg is a fine place to work.
good,"HHgregg is no longer around unfortunately."
good,Very sells drivin if you don’t sell you don’t make money really have to spend a lot of time learning about electronics can be very rewarding around the holidays and if you just a good people person
good,had to get sales on everyday basis plus sale warranty on every product. Be first to greet customers and hopefully they will buy from you so you can get commissions off of every sale.
good,"Develop and initiate new processes in order to improve revenue, profits, and behaviors."
good,They have closed down here in the Memphis are so there is nothing to review. It was a decent place to work very competitive and face paced. It did suck working on major holidays
good,Company was very successful in Mid West. They thought they could expand into areas that they were never in and dominate the market. Their commercial sales program business model was to piggy back off the retail and logistics were impossible.
good,"A typical work day at HHgregg, very busy, I learned several different software packages, also learned the dispatch tracking system, work place culture was good, the hardest part of the job was the up and down constant rescheduling hours, we would go anywhere from working 1 pm to starting a 5 am shift , and your body have to try to adjust to the constant ups and downs, the most thing I enjoyed is working on the computer's and working with the customer to make sure everything is satisfactory with delivery and purchases."
good,Learned so many sales skills from the veteran employees however I recently heard that the company filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy. Had a lot of hard working and dedicated employees 5-10 years ago.
good,"A typical workday consist of monitoring open customer orders, updating merchandise tags, helping customers with their appliance needs, and weekly i-learn product knowledge. The store level management is one of the best i've been around. The culture of the  workplace is generally positive most of the time. The hardest part of the job is the poor employee compensation. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people in need."
good,It's an okay workplace great environment great people full of life and work.great equipment and very nice warehouse.I've learned to load trailer at a fast past.
good,"hhgregg is a great company to work for. Unfortunately, a series of events led to the company closing all stores on the east coast. Competitive sales environment, and a decent pay structure."
good,Warehouse worker at HHGregg's daily duties were to help and assist customers in loading products as well as cleaning the store and bathrooms and building displays.
good,Good company to work for however need to be more associate focus.  Should give more clear direction to management and sales team.
good,"Hhgregg is a great company, although at this moment sales have gone down about 80% out of 100%. Because of that hours are cut."
good,"Hard work Learned a lot about appliances and competition of companies"
good,My days where spent mostly waiting on customer to walk through the door. Some days we would have no one come in and I would be standing there for a ten to twelve hour shift. Typically when i customer came in they where only looking or comparing prices. My co workers and i where very friendly towards each customer and greeted them properly. The most enjoyable part of my day was going through the buying process or informing a customer how they could save money.
good,Good place to work and get creative skills. Also a great place to put your customer service skills to work. Loved driving and seeing new places. Along with gaining experience  unloading and loading the truck and rotation on the back of the truck.
good,"The work is good. better than working outside like my last few jobs. upper management could use an overhaul in its thinking, but that's with every big company"
good,"I liked my fellow employees. Our managers were ok. the problem was as full commission associates we were required to clean, stock shelves, answer phones, along with help customers. And if we had no customers everything else was done for free."
good,"HHgregg is a great company to work for. But if you expect to advance in a reasonable amount of time, it will not happen unless you know someone higher up."
good,"a typical day at work regardless of it being hot, cold or rainy outside, you have to stand outside."
good,At HH Gregg I was in charge of selling products in the electronics department. I had to greet customers as they arrived and answer any and all questions they may have. To do this I had to stay knowledgeable of new technology. I also was required to keep inventory and make sure shelves were fully stocked and looked presentable. I worked week nights which were very slow. This being a  commission based job made this not so ideal. I enjoyed getting to talk about electronics all day and interacting with people.
good,"HHGregg is mix of good customer service and demanding employee participation in the customer experience. There is constant movement on the salesfloor, from employee to management. You must be good at multitasking and efficient doing projects."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be receiving an inbound trailer, offloading it, then loading out home deliveries with our 3rd party delivery service, then handling all aspects of home delivery issues as well as planning and coordinating future deliveries throughout the day"
good,I don't have much positive to say about this company. The management was subpar and there was little to no training offered.
good,"Loved this company, Loved the job, they got too caught up in growing and forgot about the people, I see an ivory tower in their future, they are heading to the same fate as Circuit City."
good,This is typical retail sales job that can be very prosperous if you are willing to work 60-80 hours a week.
good,"Employees and management are not appreciated enough. "
good,"the work day would start with me cleaning the store; bathrooms, sales floor, and warehouse. I learned that  the expectations of co-workers differ at times. My co-workers were great for the most part, few problems between them and I. The hardest part of the job was working in an undermanned warehouse. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to interact with people."
good,"loved my managers and employees. worked with my schedule, payed okay for a retail environment. overall had fun working here"
good,"Come and open the building,review the day before numbers, prepare to open the store. Have a morning meeting to set goals and expectations. Open business and provide outstanding customer service while maintaining sales goals, coaching and training employees. Sometimes closing the businessas well."
good,"I sold appliances and tv's to customers, it was a commission job so some weeks it was very stressful due to the economy. We went though too many managers, neverhad a solid team."
good,This was a good company to work for but it has gone out of business. I have to have 150 characters but there really isn't much to say since the company closed
good,"There really is not anything to say about this place, given they filed bankruptcy a few years ago and they no longer are in business. It was ok, but no real management style"
good,"learned the ins and outs on how to check and keep up with sales numbers, progress, and forecast future sales based upon adds via television and sales paper."
good,out of business company was ran poorly anyways.  never cared about the employees very shady with the way they sold to customers.  Many of the problems where from the lack of communication
good,"The warehouse side was fairly demanding due to everyday maintenance, whether that was organizing and keeping the warehouse neat. Then building and repairing shelves, putting up new displays, setting up demos for new televisions and electronics. The customer service side revolve around answering calls from customers and other stores, notifying others of what have in stock, and planning shipments for new items in place what we're lacking in-store or customer orders. But the downtime came from a lack of customer traffic during weekdays and the gradual wind-down before the bankruptcy announcement."
good,"This company filed chapter 11 bankruptcy and is no longer in business."
good,Company was not very consistent and made poor business decisions.They went out of business about one year ago and all of the employees working for them saw it coming.
good,while employed there my hours were continuously reduced to the point i had to relate a request to manger to be given more hours to make a decedent weeks saliry or i would have to find some other work
good,"HHGregg is now closed nationwide. It was ok while is lasted. I was at the age of 16 or 17 at the time so it was great pay for someone my age! But due to the CEO's stupidity, the company went bankrupt and are now out of business and all stores nation wide are closed."
good,Too much standing with no customers. Commissioned. Didn't make enough to support the family. Company then filed bankruptcy.Wish I had more hours and more pay.
good,"Closed Out Of Business.. "
good,This job required you to fight for a sale. One of the most competitive jobs I've ever had. People would do anything and everything they could just to make a dollar.
good,The company is not closed down and it was a fun place to work and I enjoyed my co-workers. I did a lot of different jobs there and I liked to be in sales sometimes
good,"Not much to say about HHGregg now, the whole company closed down. I was there for 9 years. I found it pretty easy going. There was the occasional upset customer, but that's to be expected."
good,Sell and up-sell all store products. Learned managing roles and how to lead a team to success. Hardest part I would have to say would be unloading truck and scanning each item for inventory. Family environment would be the most enjoyable part..
good,"I enjoyed working for them, I would have recommended them to my friends and family as an fair employer however they are now out of business so no matter now....."
good,"to start my day I will clock in and head to the customer service area. I would handle clients returns, purchases, and setting up delivery. Also I would make sure the area was kept clean and invoices were properly put away."
good,"The only thing that was, in my opinion, frustrating were the expectations of being a sales manager without any of the training. Even worse is when they unloaded years worth of training onto us and had to complete in a month. Wasn't a problem for me but I have heard stories from past employees that were overwhelmed to the point of leaving."
good,I like that I got the travel all over the state of Indiana and how free your work environment wasit was comfortable in need and people that I dealt with and I love the time frame that we had to get things done it wouldn't too fast and it wouldn't to slow.
good,Would have enjoyed continued employment. However HHGREGG filed for bankruptcy and closed its doors. After being informed that the company was filing bankruptcy they were very considerate in helping their employees with off time to look for jobs until the doors were closed.
good,HH Gregg had a huge opportunity to take a large share of the appliance and consumer electronics business in their respective markets.It is unfortunate that they failed to become profitable once they became a public company.60 years of doing business gone in 60 days of liquidation.
good,it ws a fun place to work ill they were goin out of business....they wanted us too work twice as hard for the same pay and will not compensate us anything as a severence package
good,"Duties include cycle count checks, audits, receiving and shipping.Management always willing to give extra training, fun place to work and great employees to work with. Positive work culture."
good,"Great place to work, good benefits. Had the best boss ever! David Linnemann. Would have stayed with them till I retired but they went out of business. This was a fast paced job with lots to keep you busy. I learned how to do time management, how to talk to upset customers and take care of any problems that occurred. The best part of the job was being able to help a customer resolve their issues. The worst part was being threatened by an angry customer. I did most of my interaction on the phone, so if a customer got to out of control, I learned to put them on hold for a bit to have them calm down so I could help them. It worked 99% of the time."
good,N?A as the company filed for Bankruptcy Hours and Scheduling was good Employee and Manager relations was generaely ok. Best part of job was meeting new people and developing customer relations of trust.
good,it was cool i deliver appliances to home and stores and set them up for the customers. we deliver fridge washers dryer stoves tv and furnisher. i like the job and i dont mind driven.
good,"Made very poor decisions.  Did not think through new procedures and business plans.  Ultimately filed chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Otherwise, the mid-level management team was good."
good,Spent 11 plus years with team hhgregg. I enjoyed my time with them. I have lots of fond memories and had a chance to work with some great people that all helped to shape the person I am.
good,"The company was sorely misguided , However I did learn so much about sales and interacting with customers. Infact, interacting with customers was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"For the first years I was there it was a blast, as it got closer to the time they went bankrupt they were nickle and dimed everything. That is why I left."
good,"Great place to work; however, store is closing. I will miss all the co-workers and the experience I gained working there. Friendly atmosphere and great culture."
good,"My thoughts are irrelevant because whole business is going bankrupt and closing. That says it all, mismanagement would be "
good,"I would assist my office team, VP, Territory Commercial Managers and act as liaison between our department and the other departments at corporate. I owe most of my experience in the work force to hhgregg.  The hardest part would be knowing there were issues with processes for years, and resolutions not developing from corporate.  My boss (VP of Commercial) was great, and I enjoyed working for the other VP, Director and managers before him.  I loved being able to reward my team for working hard."
good,I loved my time at HHGregg but sadly the company is going out of business so I am looking forward to new beginnings.  I wish everyone that worked there the best.
good,Management was always supportive and helpful.  Some sales people were cut throat and it wasn't necessary. A stupid amount of replacing signage. It could also be fun at times.
good,"Productive, happy workplace.  I love my position.  I am able to meet and greet people from all over the city and country.  It also allows me to help out our Customer Service Department with those that just might come into my receptionist area and from time to time as well as Accounting."
good,"Excellent overtime opportunities during holidays. Days were simple, unload product and put away. Using the equipment was enjoyable. Handling all types of product from appliances, televisions, small electronics to furniture."
good,"i enjoy work  there but do the bankrupsy hhgregg is closing it doors for good it clam and melow and i like, had the most amazing boss ever and i truely enjoy working there"
good,is a great place to work with some of the best in the industry training. has lost some of its appeal over the years. management is awsome and room for advancement
good,Moved through the ranks quickly and enjoyed all aspects of commission sales and then the transition to salaried management
good,"Hhgregg is a highe company.. You have to be skilled and prepared for what gets thrown at you! The hours and money is great, healthcare benefits, also it's easy to move up in the company"
good,"A typical day at work I walk the store to see if anything got sold the night before so that I can restock it. Assist customers if sales associates are occupied. Relocate items in the store when planograms change; normally updated every two weeks. I set up all electronics, build and put furniture together when needed to go out on display."
good,"LOVE my co-workers, they are always full of enthusiasm and keep me up when work gets tough. However, I have noticed there is no room for advancement or any chance for a raise. The best part of my workday is getting to see all of co-workers and friends. The hardest part is dealing with customers and the managers at times."
good,"The job was simple as any other retail experience. The location I worked for unfortunately was a slow revenue store, and didn't receive a large amount of customers."
good,working in hhgregg is not that great because there is not a lot of work to do daily. I learn how to do a better job at customer service.
good,"Challenging and rewarding. Great atmosphere be in, and the people are amazing. I learned a lot working there."
good,"Barely recieve customers, environment is great. love the people but very little money made there though!! Very little to do, not good for busy bodies"
good,"Typical day is standing and greeting each individual customer. Finding out their needs and making suggestions based on those needs. "
good,"A typical day at HH Gregg is actually pretty smooth, where the problems exist is in the upper management group ( executives, directors, etc ).  The decision making is poor and there is very bad communication there as well.  My team and I do a great job keeping up with the tasks at hand, and all of my co- workers do the same."
good,"productive work place with an high turnover rate due to, co-workers lack of work, nice people just may be lazy at times. also a heavy work load depending upon your position."
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked with, but there was too much management turn over so there was no consistency. This made it difficult for myself as well as others to perform their jobs."
good,Learning the systems and info required to do the job correctly comes with who is giving the actual info. Other than that with a little common sense your able to grasp the job pretty smoothly just have to know how to deal with angry customer for long periods of the day but the job itself was easy..
good,"If you like sales its okay, but they changed the commission scale.  By doing so it really hurt the pockets of the associates."
good,"It was an easy job, pulling product, assembling displays I did not have any issues with co-workers. Much of the department i was in worked very smoothly"
good,They look to promote from within. Supportive management and great associates. Many Co-workers have become life long friends. Completely commissioned sales floor so sometimes tension runs high.
good,"great co-workers but the corporate hhgregg continually wants it's salesman to work more for less. In my two years experience I have probably taken 4 commission cuts in one way or another. Also, as ridiculous as it sounds, be prepared to work until 10pm on The forth of July!!"
good,"Seasonal job so didn't experience much"
good,Great place to work! Having the ability to work with the public and in sales is absolutely fantastic. Learned how to become a better salesman.
good,good money when I first stared working there but customers started to dwindle as did paychecks. hours were long but is kind-of expected in retail.
good,"Not a bad job however commission only is not for everyone.  Normal sales job, must love customer interaction to be successful"
good,Working conditions arent that good. Heat doesnt work and its very cold. Work hours are ok. Management staff is friendly as well as my other co workers. The hardest part of the job is keeping busy and the most enjoyable part of the job is that you dont have a manager standing over your back the whole time.
good,"I can't complain too much because it is a fairly new store in my area, so everyone was kinda new to it. Confusing job, with more management than necessary. Overall it wasn't a bad place."
good,Co-Workers are good. Management is good o enforcing the rules .
good,"Most of the people i worked with were great, management was pretty disconnected and only really cared about numbers. I was also told that my position would not be seasonal, and in fact they do not hire seasonal employees. When the holiday season was over however, and roughly half of all employees including myself were fired, it became pretty apparent they did indeed hire me for a seasonal position."
good,"being able to help customers was what i enjoyed"
good,Upper management issues to reason for leaving. As well as commuting back and forth.
good,Really developed a good snese of running a store but the ceiling only goes so high tough to crack the next level.
good,Management was awesome and coworkers were as well.  I loved our customers and helping them with all their needs.
good,"Fun co-workers and caring management"
good,The company as a whole is a good company.  They are a little unorganized but overall they are good.
good,"Low pay rate in comparison to regional industry averages. Poor operational training at retail store locations causing issue related to inventory shrink loss, delivery errors, and customer satisfaction. Management in Raleigh LDC is excellent and, despite store errors, maintains the highest of standards for delivery int he entire company."
good,"Writing and recording shipments"
good,"I learned a great deal of customer service skills."
good,"A typical day at work was rather enjoyable. My co-workers were wonderful and there was one manager there who was great. The rest of the managers were never anywhere to be found though. Co-workers were fun to be around, and extremely friendly, but were usually slacking off or not paying attention. Hardest part of the job probably would have been trying to figure out how the computer systems worked since they would kind of just put you there and expect you to figure it out without training. The most enjoyable part of the job would have had to have been the people I came across, and the friends that I made."
good,Cut throat straight commission environment which often led to dishonest sales tactics among associates.
good,"I very much enjoyed my daily routine at HHGregg and working in that field as well as in that line of work, They do not pay well."
good,Wasn't a bad place to work really loved the work place and the employees
good,"A typical work day consist of selling, dealing with customer, and updating price tags,"
good,I was a seasonal employee here. I learned some new skills and was able to provide professional customer service to the public.
good,"not well organized , managers don't know what there doing associates are caring"
good,"Despite the fact that weekly I was required to meet quotas, our sales staff and management made selling very easy and fun so that everyone felt needed and important. The merchandise consisted of mostly new electronics and appliance products and because of the great training I received I had no trouble learning and helping our customers understanding what they were purchasing."
good,Working at HHGREGG is a nice place. The management team is so what helpful.
good,long days good pay. retail work environment . commission based
good,"•	Assisted in the setup of store processes when store was in development"
good,The people I was working with are very cool. love the customers
good,"help people to solve issues and find the correct product for their needs."
good,"Hhgregg is a fast and slow work place. I've learned how to deal with all kinds of peoples attitudes, overcome them and find solutions for there personal needs.Management can be tasking at times and most are not very well trained. Most of your co-workers are have good intentions, yet are not as knowledgeable as a customer has been lead to believe about product.The totally commissioned based atmosphere can lead to some associates being very pushy and to aggressive towards customers. The pay can be awesome when your commission goals are met."
good,"Great place to work, if you don't mind a 'performance' based or commision based income. In some cases you may be part of an over staffed department, and still are expected to achieve sales quotas"
good,"I was offered this position mainly as a seasonal employee (Nov. 2011 through beginning of 2012). The employees and managers were great people. Somewhat busy Nov. and Dec. 2011, but totally slowed down in Jan. 2012)."
good,"Working at hhgregg in the web department is very busy with customers placing online orders with questions about their order. Working everyday with my co-workers is very challenging because I have to answer questions and do things they cannot do on a daily basis,which makes my job very hard at times trying to do my job and help and answer questions for my co-workers."
good,"Worked in a warehouse unloading trucks, and pulling customer orders to load in there vehicles."
good,The compensation is 100% comission. It definitely wasn't hard to make a decent paycheck. Benefits were great. Only bad thing was management. Way too much micro managing.
good,Start the day by preparing sales area.
good,"Working here taught me a lot about myself. It was a nice enjoyable place to work. Great staff, but if you aren't a strong salesman it would be tough."
good,I really brought up my customer service and sales chops with this company and that was lead by not only my desire and drive but by some great coaches within the company. Really learned the power of networking in this position.
good,It was a good place to work out if you wanted to travel around the country. The upper management was hard to deal with at times but manageable.
good,it was fun to sell electronic equipment. It was rewarding and paid decently. It is a great entry level job for younger people
good,I usually unload a truck. Put all items on shelves. put all big appliances on the sales floor. and roll out all items that are purchased
good,good place to work but not a career. Long hours and commision only make it a tough place to work. Not a lot of personal time.
good,Managers overhired initially and let they home office dictate payroll therefore even if you are a good employee you can be let go by balance sheet management.
good,Long hours. Company does not promote from within. Company philosophy changes monthly on what items to sell.
good,"I learned not to borrow power when delegating, how to multi-task more, and to focus on emails a lot as well. The overall management team was a structure that was built on who they liked or who brought them to the table for a promotion. The culture was the same and to be honest a lot of people was there because of the money only. Nothing really hard about the job and the most enjoyable part of the job was when it gets busy."
good,I really enjoyed my time at HHGregg. It was not a high paying job but the employees and sales atmosphere made it enjoyable. Too bad they are no longer in business.
good,company went out of business twelve years after I left.  I am still friends with the original core group of people that made hhgregg what they used to be.  What happened after going public in stock offering and decisions made as a publicly traded company are far different than what privately held businesses do.
good,"My day started at 9 A.M. "
good,The company is going out of business. I was there for 10 years. My coworkers were mostly wonderful over my time there. Store management was great. Most people were happy to help you when you needed it.
good,manager didn't know how to talk to his employees at all always had attitude even when doing things right. always made jokes about you or laugh. he didn't take his job seriously
good,"Good Company to work for however, due to their current economical issues, Customer Service is suffering. Inventory issues are rampant. Customer satisfaction difficult to achieve!"
good,"Most months trying to do sales here, there was a large deficit of customers. I spent a large amount of time not using all my tools and knowledge I learned over the course of the job, due to lack of business and lack of stock. It was a fun job, and very great experience. Just wasn't as serious or profitable as my efforts were turning out to be."
good,"A typical day includes you standing there for hours and taking maybe 7 customers a day and hoping that at least 3 of them aren't ""just looking"". I learned how to manage electronics and how to go in-depth in terms of TV features. Co workers were great. Management was good besides urging for sales to be pushed. Sales were the issue. If you sold a 4K TV and it came back in less than 30 days because the TV has its own issue or buyers remorse, it came right back out of your check."
good,Management is overworked.  They need an improvement in the sales associate compensation.  You might spend a couple hours with a customer and they return on another day to purchase products with your order sheet and other associates process the order with their number and have the audacity to leave the order sheet for you to see.  I believe in being fair and honest not just to customers but fellow workers too.
good,You have a lot of things that need to get done and some times you do not have the coverage or the time to complete all the tasks on a daily basis.
good,This company is not very supportive of its sales people. Some good managers but more bad ones. I have seen people fired for very small infractios.
good,full commission sales staff. Very cut throat and competitive environment. Management is very structured and on point.
good,"hhgregg is a small company with plenty of upward mobility for those who are dedicated.  With a commissioned sales force there are significant managerial challenges in regards to managing people, but those who are successful can bonus regularly and enjoy a relatively easy day to day work life.  "
good,"9 hour days with 1 hour for lunch. management is engaging and helpful. Hardest part of the job are slow days, you have to stand in one spot and wait for customers."
good,"I work the sales floor, taking sales ups. I connect with the customers find there needs & wants. I meet there needs and wants. I let them know all of the products available, and close the sale. I follow up on the delivery, and contact the customer for over all experience."
good,"HH Gregg was a great company to work for and I enjoyed my time there. My only issue came from the fact that I was promoted and stayed in the same store, usually upper management will relocate u. So my one time coworkers became my employees and the respect level was never were it needed to me in my opinion. besides that the pay was excellent, and work environment was fine. The hours were crazy but that's to be expected in a retail. overall good job."
good,Great Company. Focused on the customer.No room for advancement. No Accountablity in the stores. When accountability is held upper management disregards and blames managers for failure.
good,"Change is constant and necessary, to keep pace in today's world of Appliance & Electronics retail.  So much so, that a company that made it's bones selling kitchen appliances, washers & dryers, TVs and home theater can't be content simply sticking with the old stand-bys.  The additions of Serta and Tempurpedic bedding products, Ashley and Berkline furniture, and fitness equipment, along with the partnership with Verizon Wireless,a digital center product line that continues to evolve, and driven by a commission-compensated sales force, make h.h. Gregg the competitive, soon-to-be national player that it is."
good,"Management does nothing about their favorites. Commission based. Overtime, even though scheduled, can lead to going into the dark depths of draw, making paychecks small, for the next few weeks. Sneaky salespeople will ""walk the wall / troll for customers near the high commission items to try to steal them or snake them from other salespeople. Management is shaky. Our store manager is a perfect example of someone who has risen far beyond his abilities. You'll spend a lot of time replacing tags, and your customers going to the favorites. If you need a job badly, and can sell, hhgregg may be the place for you. Or if you live with Mommy and Daddy and don't need to pay for food and shelter. Corporate will change costs at will, most times reducing your commission, with no explanation. Questionable and possibly illegal practices. Have updated resume handy, and keep looking. Management has their favorites, and they can run the place, while others can make one mistake on an order or delivery, and have their entire commission taken away. Don't believe what they tell you what you will make.. Lies."
good,"A typical day at HHGREGG is quite redundant in the manner of purchase/exchange. The rewarding part to that is helping a customer find satisfaction in their purchase that fits both need and budget. The associates there are polite,professional,knowledgeable, and patient. The hardest part of this job is idle time when shoppers are not active, whether through inquiry or actual purchasing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the public, you just never know what extent of impact your presence may have."
good,"HHgregg is no longer in business so this review wouldn't be any help to someone, that was seeking a job with this company. I enjoyed working for the company."
good,"I enjoyed working for them in the Appliance Department. There were more customers through the year in appliance section than maybe other sections such as TV. Stove breaks, have to replace quickly. Also was easy to get referrals from clients since kitchen appliances are more personal. Work atmosphere was fine, you had to produce but that is the same for any commision job. Hours were long sometimes but that is retail. Where I worked management was pretty good. Was sorry to see them close but competition became furious and I feel like Headquarters became lost in what they wanted to sell."
good,"The company provided a positive work environment that promoted understanding at all levels. "
good,the company was a pretty decent place to work the only thing that I did not like was the management and rude the customer were at times. The whole day was answering phone for irate customers and trying to sole the problems
good,I loved my job. The commision rate wasn't to great. However that doesn't matter now seeing as the company is out of business now. I would have loved to go back. The company had good morals and wanted to be there for the people. This day in age you don't get that personal connection with people. Everything is online.
good,Hhgregg was a good company but then went bankrupt.   They never got on board with changing times.   Nice people in the store though to work with but upper management really never was in touch with what was going on.
good,constant interaction with management. The hardest part of the job was when the shift ended the most enjoyable part would be teaching/assisting others. The culture was an experience with a lot of interacting.
good,it was good job but terrible managment and they didnt pay there employees very well. the commission was based on 1% to 2% of what you sold which is okay if you sold a lot which wasnt a problem for me but wasnt for others
good,nice place to be at time coworkers made the time go by management could use more training on how to deal with employees the employees more training to
good,"In store level of company is a great work place, attitude is contagious...upper management needs to work some days in store to realize how to improve and make the company great again."
good,Hhgregg was a great experience. I learned a lot over the time of my stay. I would have loved to continue to work for the company but due to them filing chapter 11 my position and 1500 more was eliminated.
good,"Where to begin? I've worked at HH Gregg for nearly a year and it has been a very interesting and rewarding experience overall. "
good,"Good company to start with to understand how commission works, although given the other companies who compete with this field of work can effect your sales if you cannot give the ccustomer what they want. the goal is too stay out of draw, if you can do that you can be great here."
good,Delivered furniture to clients. I made sure that everything was placed where the clients wanted everything to be setup.
good,Easy job with easy duties such as unload truck stock items and help customers load merchandise and also clean restrooms and make sure store is clean
good,"My usual workday begins when I arrive early to turn on the various HDTVs in my assigned HT department, arranging the merchandise, assembling the display tags, and staying on point near the entrance to attend and welcome any customers coming inside. I make sure they are greeted courteously, then I approach them with confidence and ask if they need any assistance in looking up a specific product, ask questions and demonstrate to make the customer interested, offer a solution, and closing the deal while making sure they come out impressed. Since the store I work at is located in a quiet, warm plaza not too far from my community, it doesn’t get as much customer traffic compared to the other competitors like Best Buy and/or BrandsMart but we do get our busiest customers on the weekends and special holiday deal events such as Black Friday and President’s Day. "
good,"Commission Is a very good way to make money if you're good at it."
good,Not a very successful company! Cutting salaries is not a positive outlook. Benefits are lacking for this type of company.
good,"They put a lot of work on the delivery drivers. You would have to work there for a while to  get a good route. The hours are very long and the work load is heavy. If you have a family this job isn't for you. They sent me and my fellow driver to the mountains that is the straw that broke the camels back,,,on the mountains was no rail and it was raining..i was praying the whole time..i quit the following week."
good,Poor training for hourly associates. Very profit-driven company. Lack of team-building exercises but tries to boost team-orientated goals.
good,"Most of the days were busy, all the employees were nice. Management was great."
good,Management was great. Enjoyed the atmosphere. Co-workers were great. Always room for advancement. If you like interacting with customers this is the job for you.
good,Not what I was looking for in a job. I needed a better job with more room for growth.
good,"Very competitive environment, you have to come there with a tough skin. People can be nice or people can still sales from right under you. The atmosphere is dealing with customers daily."
good,First experience working with a full commissioned staff and I'm honored to have had it. This has provided me with new manners to support my team and drive sales.
good,"I enjoyed my job very much. I was well train and compensated. I was promoted quickly and felt I had the needed skills to preform my job. I would have continued my employment, but the decision was made to close my location."
good,Working for this company was great. They are financially sound and they provide great pay and benefits. The hours can sometimes be long but you are well compensated.
good,You usually have great coworkers. The hardest part of the job is being the only csm working so you ave to answer the phones while dealing with customers face on/
good,you get hours but hardly no customers. its really dead and it can get boring. management is nice.
good,"Daily sales training"
good,"My job kept me busy and I liked that. My Coworkers were great and management was awesome. I wish they didn't close, I would still be working with them."
good,"Typical warehouse setting requiring hard work and precision to meet daily work requirements.  Job advancement available based on work performance.  Must posses ability to work quickly, accurately with few errors."
good,When this store first opened it was great and then the profit off of product dried up. This was a very time consuming job the dose not give you a work life balance situation.
good,A typical day at Hhgregg is finding customers need in order to find the right product to sale them. Up selling   was part of my job which was the only way to make a decent paycheck. Working for commission was new to me  i had to adapt with quickly and i was successful at it  .Most of the manager i worked with were fun to work while getting work done. the hardest part of the job is when there is no customer walking through the door on the other the most enjoyable part of the job is when customer is walking in the door.. Overall its not a bad place to work  it just harder to make money nowadays.
good,"One of the best place to work. Great management team that will accommodate barely any schedule whether full time or part time, and the pay plan is great."
good,customers and co workers were fabulous the management was poor
good,Great company to work for. You have the ability to learn about technology and appliances. Great leadership that gives its associates the opportunity to grow within the company. The only negative aspect of this job is the retail hours. Other than that HHgregg was a great company to work for I truly have made some long life friends from this store.
good,"Everyday at hhgregg was like a box of chocolates, you never knew what you were going to get...in a good way. The sales would switch up weekly and have some customers coming in asking about sales from weeks ago. While this would be funny at times, the employees were always GENUINELY more than happy to inform them of the current sale and help them from there. On top of that, the employees themselves always kept the energy up and the vibes high. Through some of the busiest holiday seasons I've experienced in the business, never did tensions rise between fellow employees nor customers."
good,"Sadly they are in financial trouble and had to shutter 88 stores, and filed for bankruptcy. My job was very rewarding and we created a wonderful work environment.  I will miss working for his company.."
good,"you are a sales associate selling electronics and appliances. it is commission sales along with being paid minimum wage. Sell, Sell, Sell. If you are a sales person then this is your job."
good,"Overall great place, business is slow. Management is very aggressive to drive great results. Every sales holiday has a great enthusiasm behind it."
good,Working at Hhgregg was fun. I learned alot of new things. The only thing I didnt not like about working there was the management. The management was not a good person to manage the store.
good,Fast pace office customer service for both inbound and outbound.  Customer Service working with stores and delivery drivers to assist with making sure customers are satisfied.
good,"Clock in and ring people up. You deal with alot of exchanges, returns & price adjustments. I learned alot working there. You have to be able to handle a cash drawer really well. You're always on your feet which isn't always fun. The people I worked with were great."
good,this company went out of business due to to many New and exciting changes that caused a lack of confidence in employees pay and customer appreciation.
good,Management can be lacking at times. Expect to devote most of your time to this job. You spend more time at work than you do at home. Lots of downtime can easily put you into draw if you don't capitalize on the footsteps that walk into the store. Expect to receive exactly what you put into your work. Income is unlimited if you devote your life to this job.
good,For an electronics store it was an easy going job. I have learned a lot about electronics. Co-workers were fun to be around. Hardest part of the job was to find things to do when you have down time.
good,"A typcal day at HHGREGG was full of good sales energy as we opened with a positive meeting daily. Management was good very informative with good guidelines fro corporate for our  success! My co-workers were great as we spent alot of time together so we got to know each other well. The hardest part of the job was the schedule. I'm a single mom of then, a 2 year old and our hours we 12 a day with late nights. The most enjoyable part of my job was sales SALES SALES!"
good,This job ask a lot of you. Gives you a great sense of responsibility. Sadly they went out of business. Most of the time you have great coworkers to get you through the day.
good,"hhgregg was very competitive with other companies, managers were not helpful in completing sales. I loved the over atmosphere with the employees and customers."
good,I enjoyed many years working for them. They are no longer in business and I have been with another employer for over four years. I learned good selling and customer service skills with this company.
good,HHGregg always maintained a professional commissioned sales staff.  They trusted the employees to do their job but also held people accountable for their numbers.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time employed at HHGregg. I worked in the warehouse and did a lot of manual labor which i enjoyed. I got along with all my co workers and received fair treatment from my managers. They tried to cross train me to also do customer service which i was excited to learn however, i was trained by a coworker that had only worked there a month and was not very informative."
good,"Overall, I feel that hhgregg has offered me a fulfilling career with opportunity for advancement and I am where I am today because of this company."
good,"Typical retail aside from poor commission structure. Started making great money but as the costs of electronics drop so do commissions. Long days, frequently 10-12 hours a day, as well as limited days off especially during seasons/holidays. Management was great a majority of times aside from handling deals being stolen by other salesmen. Overall typical retail."
good,Typical day consists of numerous paperwork and follow thru emails. Managing sales associates and curbside coachings to enhance associate knowledge and customer service. Very enjoyable but typical stresses of retail come into play. Long hours are difficult sometimes. Loyal company
good,"10-14 hour work days"
good,"HHGregg is a great place to work. Fully commissioned sales associates make your job as a manager incredibly easy. The company is structured but also let's you play around with the business a tad bit too. If you are a manager, you are busy doing overrides and taking cash, as well as handling a multitude of phone calls - especially if you are a cross dock. The RMs and DVPs are great and are always there to support you. It's a small enough company that company trainings at corporate or a regional meeting spot you can regular meet and great, and even go out with the higher ups in the company. They promise that the company is expanding and that there is plenty of opportunity of growth, but all I have seen since I've started is turnover that helps you grow. If you come in as a manager don't expect the same pay as a sales associate that has been promoted (and is even less competent than you). The best part is the people and the customers. It's always a fun work day despite any customer ripping your head off. If you like retail sales; appliances, electronics, and furniture - then this is the place for you."
good,"great place, decent traffic, good products. no chance of advancement... commission based pay with no hourly... absolutely no consistency... managers are under disciplined and have no training etiquette"
good,"Work consists of helping customers with any electronic needs. You learn a lot of useful information about the newest technology and you work with a lot of cool people, but always have to watch out for your customers so you get your commission. The hardest part of the job is standing around waiting on customers to come in and the most enjoyable part is when you thoroughly help a customer out and they praise and thank you."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time with the company, however, management was very poor"
good,unload trucks on some day make sure store is clean and everything in right place bring new items to sales floor in spot that need to go
good,"This company closed, leaving no opportunities to advance in any department. If they had not closed the place was decent to work for and offered advancements."
good,"hhgregg was a really fun place to work. there was always fun people to work around and always I had good times. I definitely would have loved to continue working there, but unfortunately I had to go a different route for my career."
good,Good place to work but the DM was a really mean person. Would say terrible things to associates and management to try and motivate them. Not a good way to motivate people.
good,"worked at the HHgregg for a short while. good store and good place to work. good pay, but with the draw system, it was very difficult to actually make money"
good,Mismanagement of employees and their time.  Delivery department does not matter to anyone that works on the sales floor.  This causes delivery department to be unable to complete their task everyday.
good,"You have got to learn how to sell and sell quick 100% commisions, if you dont sell you do not get paid if you dont sell to much you get fired, great training fun way to learn about all electronics and appliances"
good,I enjoyed traveling around the country and opening new stores and markets. Was a great learning experience. Retail didn't mix well with raising a family however.
good,job was for holiday help only. I enjoy working there i learned how to assist customers and learn different qualities in electronics.
good,Answering customers question about Appliances and Home Theater produces. Making sure we have the best prices and a clean store. Dealing with customer service issues from them not understanding their own products to delivery issues. Managers assist with pricing and the more difficult customers.
good,"That company isn't really about the employee, just push for sales and up selling, work on commission no hourly base pay."
good,Hhgregg is a good company to work for very nice and com environment  but the management seems to be more concerned about the sales cost and dally check lists more then being concerned enough with the customers needs.
good,"Sometimes it may get a little ""hectic"" with the customers and the resbonsibility but, I enjoy going to work and staying productive."
good,"Long retail hours, straight commission, hard to budget. The first two years were great. Lots of sales, great pay. Then the market crash happened and people stopped spending money. It made salary go down dramatically, and on a commission-based pay scale, it was difficult to watch my salary year by year. I liked my co-workers and management staff, for the most part. The hardest part of the job, by far, was having to pull an 18 hour shift on Black Friday. The most enjoyable part of the job was making people want stuff that they didn't know they wanted."
good,"Typical day for myself was start at 8 a.m. doing inventory, checking my emails for extra daily work from corporate or other management that needed done. Managing warehouse staff with daily instructions on what needed done, as well as Customer Service staff and what their goals for the day were. Obtaining cash for registers and balancing the drawers daily. On specific days checking in and out trucks with products for the store. Hardest part was trying to get everything done on time. My coworkers were great, friendly, fun."
good,the job was awesome but the managers couldnt handle their workload and took it out on employees
good,It was a fun place to work when they were around.The work was fast paced and customer oriented.  The customers really liked the products and they loved the service that the warehouse gave them.
good,Great workplace. Commission structure sucked because of the draw system. Company was strictly commission based. Fun environment to work in and great staffed. Company sadly closed down
good,Good interaction with management. Interesting work handled a variety of duties. A lot of customer interaction. Acquired skills for customer relationships.
good,Great opportunity to expand customer service based skills . It’s truly wonderful to work with customers in person & through phone to help with whatever questions or concerns they have .
good,Created an atmosphere for training and learning of new products. Being able to convey product information and adequately communicating the right information to the customers
good,"Company was great for the most part, but unfortunately they went out of business not to long ago. I was sad to see them go because I liked my staff and management."
good,i learned stocking receiving here also but more dealing with electronic items like flat screen tvs computers laptops esc.here i also unloaded trucks and stocked
good,"HH Gregg is no longer in business, they closed the doors in March 2017. i enjoyed selling there a great team of salesmen. The problem was product selection, the moved from their core of appliances and electronics and added low-quality furniture."
good,HHGregg Delivery Center has tought me how to expand my working standards. I learned how to drive a tow motor because the job was located in a warehouse and also I worked in the office.
good,"Will learn a lot about modern day entertainment and all about different types of technology. Like cameras, TVs, refridgerators, washing mashines, dryers, and even sofas."
good,"I was a commissioned salesman and loved it.  It was my job to help people get televisions, appliances, or home entertainment systems that best suited their needs"
good,"My time at HHGregg was definitely a weird one. On the negative hand, it took them a very long time to actually get everything set up for me to start working. Also, more of a company issue, the commission system was very strange. The positives is that the job was really easy to learn, and perform. I also had absolutely no problems with any of my associates."
good,"I have worked for Hhgregg for several years and have found that they offered a lot of opportunities for advancement for individuals who are company loyal and put in the effort. Almost every member of upper management and internal/corporate that  I had the pleasure to work with all began with an entry level position within a store location or distribution center. I myself started as an hourly customer service rep and worked my way into management in just a few quick years. I always saw myself moving up within the company but unfortunately due to bankruptcy and closings that is no longer a reality. That being said there is a lot of weight upon individuals shoulders that I always have felt could have been distributed to create more positions...also creating more focus on duties and allowing for accountability. Within the last couple of years it seems that poor decision making at the top has led to the crumble of our company. Unfortunately the largest issue we faced at the store level was always a lack of accountability when things went wrong and were out of hands, but we always tried to set the right expectation and correct every situation as best we could. Overall the environment was always friendly and training and development were readily available for those who wanted to set goals and grow."
good,HH Gregg was a decent company to work for until they went public and they ended up going bankrupt.  Management was so-so after going public but top-notch before that
good,Worked for H.H.Gregg for 20 years. I gained a lot of valuable experience working in a variety of positions with in this company. Corporate office had flexible hours and was a comfortable place to work everyday.
good,Great job and management in the corporate office... Unfortunately due to other issues and current sales production company is going out of business...
good,"First place I ever worked at where I've loved the people I worked with and also the environment in which I worked. Only downside I've noticed is upper management such as regional managers on up, they don't seem to care much about the stores they reign over... and that's probably why they're now going out of business unfortunately. I was very happy for the opportunity though, and loved it!"
good,I am hoping the best for the future of hhgregg.  It has a lot of history and a large group of great employees.  This is a great retailer with a lot of potenital
good,hhgregg is a great company to work for and does more with less resources than any other comparative company. Declining Electronics sales results due to new internet competitors stopped projected growth.
good,"Currently still employed, this job is enjoyable but not fully reliable.  The pay can be good or can be bad, based upon individual performance.  Management differs but is typically great!"
good,"I am grateful for all the opportunity Hhgregg has given me. I cherish the relationships that I have developed. Unfortunately, I came in at a bad time for the company. They will soon be closing due to poor strategy."
good,"The most difficult thing about this job was having to drive on a forklift or on a clamp truck through the night. the actual work wasn't hard, just exhausting."
good,My manager was a very rude gentleman but other than that I highly enjoyed the job. I learn a lot of valuable traits and skills.
good,considering I had several jobs while attending HHgregg it was a very busy place for me to be at which I enjoyed because if i'm at a place of business that is exactly what I want to be.
good,HH Gregg is a leader with regards to upper end electronics and the appliance industry. The company is professional as well as providing seminars and schooling with regards to their merchandise.
good,It was an experience with great customers and great co-workers. I learned how to greet customers with respect. Great enviorment to work in.
good,"Long hours but, you get to learn and tinker with a lot of new technology offered through many great victor companies and educated on whats the best overall to provide to my customers..."
good,"A typical day for you in this position will have you wheeling out product purchased by customers, bringing in returns, replenishing bulk product on the floor and helping clean the store at the end of the night if you're on the evening shift. "
good,Supportive and competent management. Good co workers and an overall positive workplace environment. Ability to keep up with the latest improvements in appliance and electronics on the market.
good,"Long days, but their bonus was by far the best i had ever came across at the time of employment.  The management was great when I was there."
good,"I enjoyed working there. I learned alot of sales techniques and alot of information about electronics and appliances. I do not like how we worked under the draw method. You shouldnt have to pay back any money for working. The managers were very judgemental and werent very nice people once you actually got to know them. I did like my coworkers, it was a fun work experience besides the pay and the management. I loved working with customers and learning new stuff everyday. the store itself is a great store, they have alot of nice merchandise and great sales. It was a great learning experience."
good,"The requirement of hours and the choices of family time or work were becoming too adverse  I truly enjoyed working at several different stores from Richmond, Indiana, to Lexington, Kentucky.The friends, both professional and customer continue to be of great value to me."
good,"This is a Good company just not sure the direction they want to head.  This is causing confusion among the team members.  One week the company rolls out a new program, 2 months later the program is removed entirely."
good,It`s a great way to work out side. Also if u get tired of doing the same thing at your job. Then this is a great job to work for.
good,I learned how to interact with customers and provide outstanding customer service to every individual.
good,"delighted to do the work of making someone happy, being a skilled laborer is not always easy but end the it will make you satisfied with the work that you provide"
good,HHgregg was an incredibly easy job. Almost all of the work we did was on a clamp truck so labor was minimal. There was a crazy amount of downtime so it got boring sometimes. The people and management were great so it made time go by fast. The hardest part of the job was the monotony. That was easily dealt with being with the group I was with.
good,Great building block for an aspiring retail sales associate.
good,"you work a lot of hours on a day to day bases, good place if you can build a great team"
good,"fun but lots of hard work, many hours but pay is good. I recommend this company"
good,"Like most retail chains, the only advancement opportunities are either someone dying or moving to the sales floor. Management works very well with scheduling interests. Work flow is always steady and fast paced. Easy to do. Warehouse leadership is complacent. Could use some extra sprucing up and additional storage locations in the warehouse; something more custom fit for this location and not just a cookie cutter mold from others."
good,"One hour meeting before opening of store, making sure store was manageable, clean, and operational. "
good,It was a fast paced environment and you was mainly working on your own. As long as you did your job and did it correctly you got rewarded with bonuses.
good,"great benefits, great people customer service, sales was easy to learn. Once you follow the steps."
good,"As long as there was someone to help, I had a lot of fun. It is a place where you must constantly be learning and problem solving. If hhgregg had better marketing techniques and more productive business ventures, their competitors would have much more to worry about. The hours are long and can be gruesome, but that does not matter to any 100% commission employee who is good at what they do when it is a busy day."
good,"Bilingual Spanish & English, powerful telephone skills, able to establish immediate trust, and confidence.  Persistent, patient and sensitive to customer’s needs and apprehensions.  Effectively overcome objections to sales in a calming and convincing manner."
good,"Great for students. I worked part-time while in school. They were very flexible. Not hard at all, very cush."
good,Long hours but worth it if you have the drive to make money. You are your own boss.
good,On a day to day basis we would prep all the merchandise and electronics and we would load up everything on to the truck and then go deliver to the customers house. The people who ran the contracting business they were okay but didn't have their priorities in check. The hardest part of the job were the steps going up and down.
good,Acquired many new skills and techniques individually and as a team player.
good,Provides on the job experience that could lead to career advancement. 
good,"A typical day at work would include opening all registers, filing previous invoices from the day before as well as checking all deliveries to make sure the items are in stock and ready for shipment. Answering several calls a day solving customer issues with products, service, or over the phone shopping."
good,"HHGregg offers a more customer focused sales process than most of thier ""large box "" competitors. With a high emphisis on knowledge thier sales staff goes through 200+ hrs of training a year to stay informed on the newest technology in electronics and appliances. The staff is fairly small and works long hours together which encourages a ""family"" environment."
good,100 percent commission job very stressful.
good,Good job to have as part time while your looking for something else
good,"Before the company went under, HH Gregg was focused on customer care and service. They did their best to ensure on time and prompt delivery, and to ensure the knowledgeability of it's staff."
good,"Learned how to interact with customers and sell appliances with warranties also sold computers, tv's. Had good hours that worked with my college hours enjoyed working and learned a lot."
good,"A great place to work."
good,This company was a great place to get familiar with sales. And brush up on customer service skills. It also pushed you to want and go get more money. Definitely a learning experience
good,"Hhgregg was a great “stepping stone” job. Hhgregg taught many lessons on selling; primarily because it was 100% commission vs. a draw system. Meaning if an employee could not sell, then they would owe money to the company. A sales associate had to take advantage of each sell and make the most of it. This is because you didn’t know when the next customer was going to come into the building. A large portion of an associates opportunities to sell came from self-advertising and report, leading to repeat customers.  At some times the job was difficult, but with persistence and dedication an employee could earn a sufficient paycheck. Education and operation weight vastly on associated as well. Hhgregg, at least in my region, had many problems with installations and deliveries being executed correctly. In instances, such as these the responsibilities rested on the shoulders of the selling associate. It was necessary to fully understand delivery and installs to be able to correct problems. This job taught me not only the needed information on the products, insurance and customer service; but that hard work and determination, report, friendliness, and self-reliance were needed in sales."
good,"Would have been nice to stay there, but the CEO was not about taking care of the business. Not really sure what he was concerned with. Now there are nearly 5000 people out of work.....Thanks BOB!"
good,"hhgregg has fallen from grace over the past couple of years. It was a "
good,"A typical day at work is either fast paced or very slow, but can be very fulfilling either way, I learned much about customer service and management, as well as what kind of manager I do and don't want to be, through HHGregg, upper management can feel disconnected, but often times is very helpful when communication is open, management on a work-front level tends to be hit or miss when it comes to knowledge level and ability to communicate with subordinates but upper management does what they can to prepare and train, workplace culture is heavily based around customer satisfaction and giving the customer the best experience possible, the hardest part about the job is not knowing day to day whether a manager will uphold company policy or disregard it, the most enjoyable part of the day is how rewarding it can be to successfully help a customer."
good,I use to love my job at hhgregg. The longer i am there the less I enjoy it. Managers don't want to do their daily duties so they get passed off to someone else. Half the time you can't even get one of them to take a manger phone call. Then theres no way to move up cause they change requirements even tho you are the most qualified person for the job. They don't really want to pay anything. Then if you're hourly unless its black Friday there is no overtime. And during certain times of the year they cut hours so if you're full time you end up with non fulltime hours. And with all the sales events and things nothing on you don't really have time to have a life outside of work.
good,"its good if you love to talk to people, while you help them find what ever they need for their house."
good,"Absolutely loved the job just hated they refused to give me part time like they promised."
good,"Good companies to work for."
good,"I work on the electronics side of the store. I talk to many customers about pcs, laptops, and TV's. I learned all about customer service, how to sell, and much, much more. I enjoy working with most of my co-workers. The hardest part is dealing with customers who are not willing to buy. The most enjoyable part is when you watch a customer leave the store highly satisfied and what they were in search for they found."
good,"The job was great, however the management lacked consistency. Since the time i started until I quit, the store went through 3 managers, all with different styles. The last one I worked for made it almost impossible for the sales people to do their jobs effectively."
good,"I would deal with the sales staff on a daily basis and I created relationships since we had to work together.  So we had good repore.  I enjoyed everyone I worked, I enjoyed working with customers to resolve their accounts and to help them from keep their accounts past due in the future.  HH gregg was a good place to work."
good,"This was a really good commission based sales job. You just had to keep your eyes open, and always ask for sale. I like how they gave you the seven steps to close a sale. It was very helpful to keep conversation with customer. However, being able to get along with your co-workers is a must. If you were able to establish a bond with them, you wouldn't have to worry about people ""snaking"" you out of your sales on your days off, or while you're on break, etc. When I was there we had a pretty good system, and it was all because of good communication."
good,"The two positions I held at HHgregg taught me a lot about the retail industry as well as sales. For the better part of my employment there, it was a great store to work at. Unfortunately, towards the end the management took at turn for the worse. I'd have to say that the hardest part of the job was dealing with the way that some of the management team treated myself and my other coworkers. The best part of the job was helping customers by answering questions and providing excellent customer service. Another thing that was important about the job to me was how close all the employees were as a team."
good,The company's appreciation and reward for protocol accomplished and a job well done is excellent.
good,"I love and enjoy enhancing the customer experience while I help them narrow down there search and select the merchandise that best fits their needs. Management would never assist the strongest sale associates and their attention was always geared towards associates that had a lack of knowledge of their products. Managers wanted associates to train other associates on every day processes. I learned how to become extremely self sufficient. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I turn someone that is""just looking"" into a buyer that ends up spending 5,000$+ dollars. My coworkers were great.  "
good,was a very exciting job with the mental stress of running a business
good,"My knowledge of shipping/receiving and expertise in customer services was a huge advantage to HHGREGG entire operation.   "
good,"The environment was very great the other employees and managers where wonderful to work for, out side of the lack of growth one can achieve in the company, the knowledge one gains from the product reps and the training were wonderful and helpful in the long run."
good,Fun and friendly workplace yet productive. I learned skills that are transferable to other workplace requirements like office management as well as warehouse management. Advancement was dependent on how much you knew. Unfortunately this business no longer conducts business otherwise i'd probably still be there.
good,You had up days in business and down day. Because it is retail you needed to meet the needs of the sales force. You worked long days and but it was made up for by comping time off.
good,"Hhgregg is now out of business, however, I did enjoy working there.  I enjoyed the customer interaction and the people in which I worked with each and every day."
good,Happy with my time at HHGREGG im very hurt they went out of business. i was there for 5 years i had a good time and i will truly miss that company i learned alot.
good,left hh gregg 1 year before they closed i like being busy traffic there was slow there ive been in the tv and appliance business for over 45 years my mom and dad owned a business and grew up in that business
good,"The HHGREGG electronics store was closed in April, 2017."
good,"The company tried to have the most reasonable prices and give great customer service. Some customers took it to the limits, wanting everything for nothing making for an interesting very stressful experience."
good,"This place is OK to work for. If you are a salesperson, you are only paid strictly on comission. If you are hourly, you make about .25 cents above minimum wage."
good,"Fun at first until the commission structure completely changed. Not enough exposure, marketing wise, to gain a foot hold in the market place. So they just close the entire southeast region."
good,"Overall, like each company it has its ups and down. I loved the company and experience that came with it. Being there helped in social motor skill and quick thinking. Great job overall."
good,"Fun to work at, always allowed us to take care of our customers the right way. Compensation was never in line with other retailers for the work and hours we had to put in."
good,"This job provides an opportunity to connect with people. Typical day involves preparation of upcoming delivery product, scheduling, resolution of problems. Sometimes have to step into other roles such as operating register, merchandising, report generation as needed. Also assist with training."
good,"HH Gregg has given me a rewarding career for the last 12 years, I have had Opportunities for growth and was able to develop great leaders for HH Gregg...."
good,I love this company but they are going filing chapter 11 and it has become very hard and I am scared my store may close need to find a company to grow with .
good,"HHGregg is a good place to work.  They offer opportunities to learn new technology, contribute to the success of the business and work in a great team environment.  I have had the opportunity to further my technical skills and work both individually and in a team environment.  Management staff was a challenge but recent changes have improved that greatly."
good,Helped Customers at register with sales and returns Assisted manger delivery team with posting credit on customers accounts. Assisted sales team with entering in sales.
good,The job was fun and productive but I didn't like that I did not receive benefits because i was part time. I was a really hard worker to complete my task and i enjoyed my stay while working here.
good,"Great opportunities for advancement. But with advancement comes more time away from loved ones. Pay was great if you were in a good store, but some stores are in very difficult markets."
good,Decent job once you get the hang of it. 100% commission can be great and also horrible. during busy periods you make good money. during slow periods you make very little.
good,"HH Gregg was slow at times and busy during holidays.  Typical sales position selling appliances, electronics, and furniture."
good,This company provides all the tools necessary to excel in sales.  At the time I was employed this company had made a mistake in choosing a poor marketing firm that cost us a lot of business.
good,Great company to work for but take of a lot of your personal life. Benefits not the best. But overall they take care of employees
good,If you work hard and have aggressive sales skills you will do well. If you re looking for a clerking job don't apply. It is retail hours but overall a good place to work.
good,"hhgregg is a great company to work for. Loved selling, including learning about all the new types of product that was constantly coming in. Problem is the company is so small that it is still tough to see where the company is going. They are constantly changing their operations procedures, prices, and company goals, that it is tough to agree with their decisions. Deliveries and installation programs are very broken and set up for bad customer service expectations."
good,"open store"
good,A typical day at hhgregg was busy we learn different ways to process orders for the customer hoe to deal with pricing and delieveries management was helpful co workers was great to work with no hard part to the job the most enjoyable was interacting with different people
good,I learned that I am not cut out to earn a living as a commissioned sales person. The managers were very patient with me and my co-workers were very helpful and supportive.  The hardest part of the job was trying to convince someone to make a purchase that they were obviously not prepared to make. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet so many different types of people.
good,Great environment and they treat employees with the respect and dignity.
good,I help my guest find the right products based on their needs. Make sure I can effectively educate my guest on the current home theater or major appliance trends. Effectively meet and beat my quotas as set by my store manager. Helping out multiple guests and taking notes of every single one of their needs.
good,"Working at HHGREGG allowed me to incorporate admirable attributes of work ethic. A typical day would consists of acknowledging customers, I would familiarize myself with their electronic needs and provide them with 100 percent customer service. I learned so many good things working there, I have learned how to patiently deal with a customer, and devise a solution for his/her needs. Our management was affably cooperative and well trained. They would prevail over any obstacle that our team would face. I can hardly say anything about ""the hardest part of the job"" to me there is a solution to everything if tackled with patience, concentration and honesty. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I would come up with lucrative solutions to a customer's needs and he or she would depart the building with a big smile on their face."
good,"My experience with HHGregg was overall a positive experience. The pay wasn't very competitive and of course it was retail hours. The stores themselves are neatly organized, great customer service, fun staff."
good,*i unload a truck and put up stock and do roll out
good,"I greatly enjoyed working for HHGregg. When I first started with the company, sales traffic was huge and there was opportunity to make good money. Traffic has recently gotten slower and the job has become less challenging and rewarding."
good,it was a very rewarding sales career. there was a very strong sales culture there. weekly training modules. Managers always willing to step in and help close sales if need be. Its a shame they went bankrupt though.
good,Greeted and qualified customers for sales of electronic products. Educated customer on products and provided financing and and other offers on products.
good,This review really doesn't matter seeing as hhgreg is no longer a business and has been shut down. i worked the warehouse in the back and did enjoy my job most of the time.
good,It was a fast paced place to work before the windows were shuttered.  Great interaction with customers and sales.  On the job training was excellent and it was easy to transition working there.
good,Na just wish they would of stayed opem longer or gave us more of a warning on why they are closing stores were doing good just didn't have the product that we promised customers
good,"Excellent sales environment "
good,"it was great working for them. Like all company , it had its faults ,but over all was a good company to work for. I'm going to miss HH Gregg.It will be oe of my top 5 companies I worked in the pass."
good,decent workplace that was fast paced leading to long hours that seemed to go by very quick. loved working on third shift and i enjoyed my time there one of the best jobs i ever had
good,The company is going out of business and will be closed in a month or two so giving them a review for future hires is kind of a waste of time.  Sorry for not writing more.
good,"Overall good company. In the customer service department, they were always willing to work with my schedule and meet my needs. My managers were always will and eager to assist me with any issue that I may have. They used every situation as a learning tool, this is what I believe helped me secure my position in becoming a supervisor."
good,Was fun to work at while it lasted. Wish the company was not goong oit of business. Work balance was easy and the group i worked with was great. I will miss Hhgregg.
good,"I've worked with some amazing people here. HHGregg has given me the opportunity to grow as a leader. I've traveled to out of state locations to assist when needed, which I have enjoyed."
good,"Great pay, hours are long and hard sometimes its sales so save when the getting is good. If your not a people person move on, if you have your ducks in a row and can deal with missing out on every holiday like I can you will do good. Former owner has passed and so have most of the folks I worked with so good luck to whomever reads this."
good,"Great job, learned alot about sales, operation, and how to watch for inventory and shrink. Absorbed information about scheduling and was given a great opportunity to learn operation of the store. I really enjoy learning how a store as a whole has many different sections that must work as a whole too."
good,"Ware house work at Gregg can be a bit of a grind."
good,"A typical day at work consists of me helping my customers and making sure their needs are met . I'm always making the most out of the day . My team is great and the management is up to par . It's all about team work and that's how we succeed everyday. The most enjoyable part of my job is making my customers smile and becoming a friend they can be comfortable with when they shop. The hardest part is when they are unsatisfied with a product because I feel that same frustration when they're unhappy. At the end of the day I always find a solution to a problem so their frustrations quickly turn into joy. I have learned that in order to fully provide outstanding service , you must try and genuinely connect with your customer and   be attentive . Listening is also an important skill as well because it shows the customer that they matter and that's my motto : You Matter ."
good,Fun work place with great management. Supportive team environment from all employees. Decent amount of paper work to keep track of.
good,It was a good company that provided me a learning environment to grow and mature. I learnt many different skills which I believe will improve my life
good,Great job in the beginning to work for.  The commission pay if your good at sales can be better than a lot of company's out there.
good,"HHGregg was a great place to work, if you could make the sales. A typical day involved dealing with the customers and trying to make your paycheck. If you were a good salesman you can fit in good. I was able to learn a lot about electronics. I thought I knew a lot before I started to work there. The co-workers were always very friendly despite the competitive atmosphere. My managers were very professional but knew how to be friendly with the employees without breaking the professional barrier. The hardest thing I think to deal with was the actual selling, even the best salesman can't make someone change their mind. I enjoyed learning so much from everyone and meeting all the vendors from the products we sold."
good,"A typical day at work is making sure that the customer service front desk is clean and organized at all times and registers are filled with receipt paper. Also making sure signs are up to date with our current sales and then it's answering phone calls weather it is a question, assistance, issues, or returns. After working with the company since 2012 I've learned a lot about appliances and how to handle situations with deliveries when it goes bad. What I love the most about working with the company is that it is never a dull moment. There is always something to do and be productive weather it is helping a customer resolve the issue with there appliance purchase or being organized behind the front desk."
good,"A typical day is dealing with customers all day whether on the phone or in person. As a cashier/customer service rep i handled cashier transactions and customer issues as well. I also worked on the sales floor as needed or if i wasn't busy at the service desk.The management always communicated well with each other as well as the staff, they were also easy to speak to they felt like family.the most enjoyable part of the job is the family friendly environment and interacting with customers while the hardest part was dealing with disgruntled or unsatisfied customers. My co-workers were very pleasant people and easy to get along with."
good,The compensation was all dependent upon your own earning.  I liked that but if you did not make the quota per week then you had to pay back the amount that HH Gregg did not achieve by your lack of sales
good,"Great place to earn a living but there is no  time for a personal life but if you can deal with that you'll love it as I did, very competitive. What I enjoyed most is the awesome commission checks."
good,"At HHgregg depending on the day, I would load and unload truck and put all the product away. I would make sure the warehouse was organized and everything was not to hard to find. Also, I would clean the sales floor and the restrooms at the beginning of each day. Also, I would take the customers product out to their cars. I learned how to become more organized and how to clean a public restroom. My co-workers were very interesting and different. We had a couple of incidences were an employee was verbally harassed Management was horrible minus my supervisor. Upper management never involved themselves with warehouse and only cared about the sales floor. The hardest part of that job was dealing with angry customers; I was always a part time cashier. There was no real enjoyable part about working there."
good,"Overall decent job, Need better management, customers can be a pain  sometime but thats why you have to have patients to deal with there issues,"
good,If you love technology hhgregg is a great company to work for.  You will have the chance no matter what position you in to make  a lot of money.
good,"Did commission based sales, selling Furniture, Electronics, and Fitness equipment. Learned how to find out customer needs and the steps to selling, My management was always helpful, and my coworkers were good at providing goals to keep up with. The hardest part of the job was closing sales, but also the most enjoyable."
good,HHGregg allows for quick career growth with it's efforts to become a nationwide MAJAP retail chain within the next 10 years.
good,"H. H. Gregg is a very good place to learn different things an to grow. I learn how to be a sale assistant as well as a awesome customer service/ administrative assistant. The allowed you to handle your personal business and etc. Management was right there with you 24/7. They never thought they was better than you or ask you to do more than you could, because they was learning as well as you was. If they was hiring again i would apply."
good,A work day a Hhgregg would involve being attentive for potential customers while maintaining your work area. The managers and fellow employees are always helping you understand product. Working at Hhgregg will help anyone with potential master their products and how to sale them to meet their customers needs. My personal experience with Hhgregg began in the warehouse and unfortunately it was during the holiday season. My determination paid off when I received a promotion to sales associate in appliances. I later was promoted to sales associate in electronics.
good,"If you can stand on your feet all day and sell things, this job is for you. 90% of the job is commission if you like that kinda thing."
good,"HHGREGG is a consumer electronics and appliance retailer that is growing steadily and making an impact in every new city. While the economy has affected those who work commission sales, HHGREGG gives its employees an opportunity to maximize one's pay check with a large assortment and selection customers can choose from. The management is fairly good, but there is high turnover. This is a great company as long as you are determined and hard working. It is frustrating working a sales commission job in this day and age, but as long as your resilient and steadfast this company is a great fit."
good,"h.h. gregg initially was an easy place to work and make money. As time progressed, however, I seemed to make less money every year and had to work harder for it. Management's idea was to bombard the store with commissioned salesmen. This meant less money per salesmen. Additionally, a lot of questionable behavior went on with no reaction from management. As long as management hit its numbers, they really didn't care what went on,"
good,This was a great place to work until it started having money problems. The lack of profitability on electronics and televisions caused the closing of all stores eventually.
good,"Good place to work, however no longer in business.  Learned a lot of different info on a vast amount of products.  All commission could be challenging.  Nice recognition to sales force.  At the end commissions were cut, ominous signs of GOB.  Left after a couple of years. My first two managers were quite sub standard and unprofessional duo, latter managers were very instrumental in increasing store and individual metrics.  Loved the latter managers, disliked the first two. Outstanding company to work for."
good,"Not a lot of customers, competitive pay, commission pay. Great electronics. Friendly staff. Good location. Great training. Fast pace job. Bi weekly pay"
good,"From a small, family owned retail company to a large, dominant regional retailer, hhgregg grew to a $2.5B chain of 230 stores.  Being a part of this company during its unprecedented growth was incredible and afforded a very real contribution to its success.  My career spanned 35 years and during that time I had the privilege of working with some very talented people who worked well together to carry out a culture of putting the customer first."
good,"Typical Sales environment: inventory, commission sales, cashier duties, merchandising, service logs, customer service.  Great atmosphere.  Competitive."
good,fun place to work at with advancement opportunity. great benefits. management worked with staff to gain maximum sales opportunities. working at hhgregg felt like a second family
good,the job was ok up i learned organize deliveries   until the end whe the contractor bailed with out paying me my last three checks which was very unprofessional
good,company went under   so it would be in your best interest to not work here any more or even think about working here anytime soon i just wanted to do this review
good,"Be prepared to work based solely on what you sale. Majority of your work is going to come from upselling. People know what they want to buy, you just need to show them what they NEED to enhance their purchase."
good,Great at first with decent commission payout as long as you knew your product what to sale with attachments and warranty but when ceo's milked the company payouts declined with hhgregg bankrupting and shutting its doors.
good,Best part of the day is that you get to meet people and because of it being a sales position you get to work on people skills. It was a team environment which was good.
good,"Come to work set up routes get teams off dock I learned how to manage a large staff"
good,Was a great place to work and the people where and are great to bad it's going out of business . The product selection was great and learned a lot while working there.
good,Work pace is pretty steady and the people are easy to work with. The training that is provided for you is a little shaky but overall is an easy place to work. The environment is laid back and duties are simple. Hardest part of the job is working with customer issues and keeping up during our busy hours.
good,Hhgregg is a great place to work and obtain sales and customer service experience. Providing each and every customer with excellent service and superb product knowledge with having fun.
good,"If you don't mind lifting a lot. then that's the job."
good,"In my brief tenure at hhgregg, I observed some really great practices and also some not so great trends.  I'll start with the good.  The store manager truly cares about his employees and his customers.  The assistant managers always seemed to be put out, over worked or just plain cranky.  The commission tiers were great when they had a diverse spread from 1% to 4% however over time, the company lowered the tiers.  Many products that would pay 4% now pay 2%.  Also, there is a shark mentality in the store.  Not many associates will watch your back and make sure you get credit for your sales.  Training was also horrific with a tortuously slow internet connection to watch videos... "
good,"I was offered a better paying job is the only reason I left, the people you work with were pretty awesome. Good group of people. Still a customer today."
good,It was an overall good environment to work in. There were a few managers who were not as proficient as they should be. Instead of being concerned with having good employees they were concerned the good employees would take their job. Besides those it was a great place to work. I learned quite a bit of my computer skill and phone skills there and really enjoyed making sure every customer was as happy as they could be. I enjoyed being sure no one was being defrauded any of their money and that their products were delivered in a timely fashion.
good,"I enjoyed all my previous jobs they gave me opportunities to meet new friends and meet different kinds of people, I learned a lot how to take care of customers  problems and do something about it and give them satisfaction,"
good,"working as a Customer Service Merchandiser/Cashier, I am always interacting with customers, and through this have gained a proper knowledge of different attitudes and ways to handle them. Have a good Management team who train to meet any customer issues and supports if any issues arises.Good co-workers who help and support each other to succeed."
good,"My overall experience with H.H.Gregg has been in between good and bad. The experience that I had which made it pretty fun was, learning about new products, interacting with customers, the reps that cam and told you about products. "
good,Hard work can sometimes be a grind but very rewarding.It is one of those jobs that the harder you work the better you would be off.
good,"my typical day is taking the cash drawer.  I cash people out paying cash and help out customers on the phone or in the store out to the best of my knowledge,  I help sale associates with roll out to their cars."
good,HHGregg Is A Good Company To Work For With Much Room For Advancement As They Push To Grow. While With The Company I Was Able To Use Skills Acquired From Previous Positions To Gain Progression Within. While My Work Ethic Speaks Alone Having Prior Experience Helped That.
good,I got a job with hhgregg to have some part time work during my senior year of college. I was able to be successful and pay my way through school. I created many relationships with customers. I had to stop working at hhgregg because I play an intercollegiate sport and did not have the time.
good,"Train and lead sales force of 15 sales force and 12 operations associates."
good,"i learned alot about all the products we sold. and alot about what goes into the warehouse and coding even tho that was not part of my job. i made a lot of friendships, but it was very educational also."
good,learned alot of hands on skills and also building skills that will help me in the future. working in the warehouse also helped me with organizational skills i still use today.
good,I'm ready to advance my career. It's a great place to work however very boring at times
good,"work with great people"
good,in at 8am long days nights and weekends are required.  an ever changing industry and evolving company.  hardest part of the job is balancing work and life.  The most enjoyable part is its ever changing and dealing with people
good,"This job is exactly what you can expect from mostly any other retail job. a typical day at work can range from working with few customers and filling the time with paperwork or other preparation duties for the next business day, to having multiple customers at once and learning to effectively multitask in order to make everyone as happy as possible. Management is very encouraging and love to help you succeed."
good,Working there for several years has given me valuable experience in sales. New selling strategies and learning what new technology is coming out. Working with others there can be a bit stressful being a commission only job.
good,A work day at H.H. Gregg was always different with many types of customers visiting each day. I learned to respect and be patient with everyone you meet. You never know what their situation may be and to put on a smile no matter what. The management staff became friends of mine because they treated their staff with kindness and patience. My co-workers became like my family. We all enjoyed working together and that's what truly makes a job worthwhile. There were times I had very demanding customers that wanted everything to go their way and I did my best to make that happen and see them walk away happy. I truly enjoyed the day to day duties of my job. They gave me a sense of significance in how I was helping the company.
good,Great retail location to work at...the staff was very friendly...they provided lots of working hours and competitive pay
good,Great Benefits

good,"helping customers, answering the same question for the hundredth hour"
good,"merchandizing product"

good,I enjoyed my experience there. You get what you work for. Management was ever changing so continuity was difficult to maintain at times but all in all I worked with some great people
good,"A typical day would be taking care of customer issues, whether over the phone or in person when they came to the store.  Employees were always motivated to work."
good,Very friendly place to work. nice employees and managers. They also have nice clean areas to work in. They are a customer friendly establishment and they pay for travel and expenses.
good,The best job I ever had hated to see it go but the rich didnt know how to handle their money. It was sad. Best buy survived barely but I didnt expect this company to fold.
good,"It was a good place to work. It was very competitive place, because of commission. I had no real problems with this company other than the closing of the company."
good,Working in the warehouse was a fun and fast paced environment. There is always something to do even if it seems like it is getting slow. Good place to also enhance warehouse skiils.
good,"i work for then for almost  5 years, and even i moved in the state of florida a lot they always give me a job   is ashame the close down their doors. a lot of people miss this company and like me think is a shame they close down cause the ceo took then to bankrupt."
good,Some what non professional but the stores were closing down . The staff was paid in a uneven matter. Issues were addressed unprofessional the best part were the coworkers as human beings
good,A typical day at work was going in and maintaining price points on the various product. I was a Appliance specialist and entertainment specialist made the presidents club and was taken to a all expense paid vacation with all the other president club members. It was a great place to work at the beginning of the store opening up great perks and a good work environment but they tried to compete with the other big stores and started to cut commissions and pay that it drove sales associates away..
good,HHgregg was a great place to work. I was compensated very well and they were willing to work around my college schedule at the time.   The only thing I did not like about the company was working the late hours during the Holiday season.
good,"i enjoyed my job and coworkers while employed at HHgregg. Unfortunately, the company had to file bankruptcy and is no longer in business."
good,"Enjoyed helping train and hire new employees, also learning about the newest electronics and house wares from microwaves to the latest fridge. Always changing of stock, so there was also something new to learn about."
good,"They were a very good company. They cared about all employees. It was like family.  The most enjoyable part is learning, and advancing quickly. There was nothing really hard about the job."
good,Loved everything about it besides some days where it was stressful. I had to not only deal with my job in inventory but also deal with customers who were nasty.
good,its a good company that i as happy to be a part of. i learned a great deal working with the leadership that they had in place. would highly recommend the company.
good,great place to learn and grow--they are now out of business nationwide. i was the number one person in sales profit and warranty sales in the region of 22 stores.
good,"HHGREGG was a great company for me. I began working for the company right out of high school.  It provided great working experience.  I have been there for almost 7 years, working from warehouse to sales,  and managing until the company went under ultimately closing down. My team members where great. I did my best to help them out and helped me out when there was work to be done."
good,"Loaded trucks "
good,"Had amazing managers, got deals that you probably couldn't get anywhere else, and overall was an amazing experience. I learned the skills of sales and communication."
good,"Always a new challenge right around the corner.  Spent four years with the company and cherished each one.  If it weren't going out of business, I would consider staying a few more years."
good,I liked that job got discounts sell auctions my boss was cool and layed back the people are ok..just needed more hours it was fine just got tiered working night
good,"Very friendly co-workers who where reliable and easy to count on. The management team was very knowledgeable and easy to work with."
good,"hhgregg is/was a fun place to work for 28 1/2 yrs.  We had yearly employee cookouts, as well as monthly individual pitch-in for each departments.  I am so sad that they are closing!"
good,HHGregg is going to be closing in a few weeks and will not be employing anyone anymore. I enjoyed my more than five years working there and am sad to have to leave.
good,Company gave great opportunity to work with customers and learn product. I learned a lot about electronics and appliances. Also how to handle situations with customers. The workplace was great often times I worked with friends because every employee in that building is friendly. The hardest part unfortunately was dealing with the companies lack of product.
good,"I built my skills as a sales associate, and loved working for my managers, The workplace culture was very relaxed and we all worked well together. Being on full commission was a challenge at times, but overall great company."
good,Management work day is 10 hrs 5 day a week and that is maintained. Work day began early all associates very well trained in there position self starters. Goals were clearly  communicated and management supported the team to reach those goals.
good,Very great place to work and meet a lot of new and interesting people. Good training is available and it's a pleasure to go in to work. The days go by fairly quickly and when there are good sales. The management is also very skilled and helpful.
good,My fellow associates are great people to work with.  Fun atmosphere and challenging work at times. Store management could be more team-oriented and prioritize a common goal instead of departmental advancements. Amazing work/life balance.  Management understands your needs for personal time.
good,"I enjoy the customers I encounter on my daily route ,especially when you deliver they product and they kitchen looks fantastic and they are amaze with your work and they can't stop raving about your wor"
good,Working with customers every day to help them get what they need and make sure they no about the products.Make sure its what they need and that they keep the items

good,"Good place to work. "
good,besides not having an actual hourly wedge the commision paid of most of the time specially if you have a smile on your face and have very good people skills.
good,"Working for HHgregg was a fun experience, and learning the sales environment was an eye opening experience. While I had worked in sales before, never had I worked on a commission base pay before. It was interesting, but not my favorite part of the job, due to low foot traffic and difficult to understand pay rates."
good,great workplace not to busy a lot of downtime to just kill time or find busy work like clean an stock not to interesting but what ever pays the bills
good,This co. is great customer service is a lot better than best buy just visit one and see for yourself. The best thing that I like about this co. is that they have no restocking fee unlike best buy and they will refund the difference if your purchases  go on sale after bought them.
good,Love the company and  the acknowledgment the company shows their employees. Very professional company. Mangers are beyond wonderful. Easy to move up with the company

good,"Lots of activity, always busy, and room for improvement.  The job was what you made it, and I learned a lot.  I'm glad I had the years with the company I did."
good,Typical day at work was standing around and cleaning trying to find something to do to pass time. i learned how to communicate with customers better. Management wasn't all that great didn't really know how to keep the business running and wasn't around when you needed them. The most enjoyable part was that you had a customer leaving out the store with a product with a smile on there face.
good,When it is slow I have to find projects to work on.  I enjoy the competitive/commission sales.  I strive to be the number 1 salesperson for the day.
good,"High Pace Sales Job, if you know the product and work well with people you can make it work at HHGregg.  Do not treat their employees well enough for as much work you put in for them"

good,Hhgregg is a great company takes care of their customers and their associates. The atmosphere along with the sales reps were awesome.
good,"I love Hhgregg. I would recommend anyone to work here, whether they have sales experience or not. The people here are amazing, and the managers are laid back as well. Everyone here is approximately the same age group. The youngest is 19 and the oldest is 35, so there is a lot of energy in the store."
good,"I was trained in many areas of inventory management."
good,"A typical day at work is concentrated around assisting customers and selling them the proper products for their home. I have been cross-trained on both the electronic and appliance sides of the sales floor. Management is very instrumental in helping us close deals with customers. The hardest part of the job is staying focused during down time. The traffic in our store doesn't compare to the traffic in some other stores in the region and getting tired or bored and uninterested due to long waiting periods between customers generally has negative effects. The most enjoyable part of the job by far is assisting customers, building relationships with those customers and finding pleasure in knowing that you sold them the right product."
good,sell sell sell hhgregg was the type of place where u had to move everything out the door a great place to get ur startin exp in sales

It important to provide continous customer service and try meet their needs. It important to maimtain a workimg and professional relationship with my peers and mangement, we are forever learning something on a . I love my job ,I enjoy being around people and assisting people in thier endeavors. The hardest part of my job is not making a sale that day it a big factor on your income when you are working on commission."
good,Ive learned alot loved environment great place to learn team was great.
good,"worked there for a brief time, they really do want the employees to succeed."
good,"I love the atmosphere just wish the pay was better. It can be relaxing most of the time, it's a lot of laughing & playing but the work gets done in the process if its a persons 1st job it would make them love to work."
good,Out of business.  Great place to work though.  They had a great structure.  I was fortunate to have some great managers there.  It was a good experience.
good,"Although the company is no longer in business, I will always thank the experience I had working for the company. Balancing a business that functioned as a full commission sales floor while also working with traditional retail hourly staff was simultaneously the most enjoyable and most difficult part of the job."
good,"HHGregg was a very friendly mannerly environment, I enjoyed that it was relaxed and open. The management was very presentable and relatable and my coworkers were friendly and helpful."
good,A very fun place to work at the work environment was very fun to work at overall the managers helped a lot in the training so I learned a lot of them.
good,"My typical day at work consists of selling products to customers, and helping them out with any issues they might be having. HHGregg is closing all of its stores so do not try to work there."
good,The store level is well run and definitely fun to work at. Executive management has failed the company and made plenty of not smart decisions in regards to product and stock level.
good,I'm a hard worker team player quick learner I ran the store and warehouse and did inventory in charge of getting everything on the floor and rolling customers TVs tables and couches to their cars
good,"Typical day at HHGregg was basically making sure washers and dryers was aligned right, Tv's turned on and ready to be displayed. Coworkers was the best part of the job. Everyone got along and everyone helped one another when needed. Management had my back when I would hit a rough patch. Only difficult part of the job was loading awkward items into the customers cars, selling was no problem."
good,I was required and hired for seasonal position so even though i most likely would have kept working there it was a certain need to have people at that time and i was fine for them giving me the opportunity
good,"Working at Hhgregg I learned a lot about how to communicate with customers. There were a lot of changed being made toward the end of my employment with them. Such as schedules, and different tools we'd use everyday so it got a little more difficult."
good,"Extremely fun-spirited atmosphere with a highly approachable management team.  Four inter-working parts of the store (Warehouse, Sales, Customer Service Merchandisers and Management) interacted with respect and camaraderie to execute each part of the smoothly operated whole. My position's greatest challenge entailed seamlessly multi-tasking between phone calls, customers and sales team members with brief but accurate efficiency so that the sales and management team could focus their attention on building rapport and making sure the customer's specific needs are being satisfied.  Taken with me was an advanced knowledge and experience of customer and vendor relations."
good,we did things like a family we work on everything as a team we happed each other when it was need. i learn a lot of new things that helps me in my everyday life. the hards part of my job was that i had to leave and found my path
good,A typical day at work consist of getting the stations ready in the morning including checking tags. After that's when the day really starts and the selling begins.
good,"Company is always looking to grow and there is plenty of growth opportunity with them, especially if you are relocatable.  The pay structure for management is more bonus incentive then anything, which is a major flaw in compensation for the work managers have to put in.  BUT if you hit you goals over LY then and actually make bonus, then the compensation is worth it.  Upper management is very good at communicating and you do not need to jump through hoops to get an answer, you can call or email the question directly to the person who can get you an answer or they will redirect to someone who can ."
good,"The typical work day is very exciting, fun, teamwork is amazing, and the managers are awesome. i have learning a lot about customer service and handling them to help serve there needs. I enjoy helping others including other employees. I have trained a lot of employees by providing them with everything i have learned in my recent years of customer service. The management team is awesome and very helpful, there is always someone in management to help with what ever i needed. There were roughly 26 co-workers that i worked with and they were all very awesome when it came to being professional. the hardest part of my job was calming customers down after being mistreated by certain employees. i felt it was my job to help them with whatever they need. the most enjoyable part my job was meeting new people"
good,hhgregg was really slow. management was really helpful and supportive also. most days were really fast paced and i really enjoyed putting that large sale together.
good,This company has allowed me to grow and determine what my long term goals are for myself.
good,I was with this company for almost 4 years and I hate that my relationship with HHG is no longer a working one. I left the company due to reasons that were personal but I have to admit that after being in retail for several years and experiencing other retail environments that HHG is hands down the best in the biz. They truly do care about their associates all the way down from corporate in Indy down to the warehouse members in each store. Great positive experience that I miss but also learned a great deal from. Excellent benefits and pay as well.
good,I love hhgregg inc. It was a fun and exciting place to work. The management worked with us to make more money ourselves and for the company.
good,"In an area where sales come often, a lot of pressure from management to meet certain goals."
good,"loved working for hhgregg, great experience but the scheduling was very difficult to maintain due to me being a single father."
good,They really focus on training and customer service at the locations I've worked for. Had a excellent relationship with most of my managers inside and outside of work. If I could go back I would in a heartbeat. I'm gonna miss this place
good,Enjoyed working there for almost 26 years. Now a casualty of the current retail apocalypse that seems to be taking down many companies. I will miss my friends and associates.
good,Working for HHGregg allows me to balance work and family with a more relaxed attendance policy. It is fun to come to work and be in the relaxed atmosphere. Most everyone is willing to teach and their goal is to expand your learning.
good,"Open the store up by counting drawer, bringing up registers to start the day, prepare bank deposit to be taking before 11am daily."
good,"Commission based job makes the worker provide the highest customer service, because how well you perform is based on your pay. Learn to manage yourself and make smart decision to make profit. The hartest part of the job is the pay checks is not consisted."
good,"HHGregg came into my life at one of the lowest points in my life.  I had been out of work for 6 months and living in a homeless shelter.  I had never worked in commission sales and I was afraid, but I was also desperate. 'Since the 1st day I started working there I sang, that's how glad I was to be employed again.  "
good,Pretty good job with great people. Loved my time there. Few employees so we felt like family.  Hard to deal with some customers at times.
good,"I perform maintenance and repair on 75 locations. There is a lot of drive time but I am able to conduct my work without any supervision, which I like a lot."
good,"Great people, good managment, good company"
good,This was a fun place to work. I learned a lot about electronics equipment. I gained a lot of skills and had a lot of great coworkers. I was impressed with the quality of their furniture and electronics.
good,"I was recognized for the hard work I would always put in. Within the first 3 months I was promoted, and pay raise was more than I anticipated! My warehouse team were great workers and took directions very well. All in all, if you're looking for a good company to work for, and wish to move up in position, HHGREGG is a good place to work."
good,"Good company to work for. I enjoyed the people I worked with. I worked 6 am til 2:30pm, loved the hours. I learned to drive a high low. I loaded and unloaded semi's with appliances."
good,"Working part time for Hhgregg is quite enjoyable, where each day i am there I help customers find the best solution to their needs. I have worked in both Home Theater and Home Appliances, and always have competitive numbers being that i believe in total sales solutions, making sure my clients have everything they need and know what they are buying before they walk out the door the first time. I have learned how to package items and services together, as well as understanding better ways in encouraging customers to buy."
good,"Hands on with operations including warehouse, customers and inventory."
good,when this job paid on commission the pay was excellent and set a very good environment.  towards the end of my time with the company they had a directive to move more towards hourly pay and expand on products sold. We had focused on home theater and appliances during most of my time there and by the end had added beds and other furniture pieces.
good,I really Love this job before it closed down. Great environment to work and fun coworkers. I learn about top down selling and patience working here. I was taught by the best in the business.
good,"I loved it here and would stay if they were not going out of business!  I loved all the people I worked for, and how we worked as a team.  I hope that my next adventure will be as fulfilling as this one."
good,Being a customer service merchandiser at HHGREGG was very educational. I learned more about electronics and appliances than what I expected. Management skills were great and every situation and customer issue was handled professional. The hardest part of the job was being unable to satisfy the customer due to inventory. the most enjoyable part about this job was meeting coworkers.
good,company is out of business- I assisted customers with their purchases by answering questions providing product knowledge and providing the best possible sales experience.
good,"This place is closing. I loved the discount on the home decor, the people were great. I had to leave due to the set hours. they sold cheap t.v's . great group of people."

good,"•	Experienced in shipping and receiving merchandise"
good,"This is a overall great place to work. I love to work in an open, fast pace environment, meeting new people and assisting them with their needs, the feeling just overwhelms me with joy. I love interacting with my fellow team mates, teaching and also learning new techniques of sales methods, to help meet, not only the companies goals but also meeting my own expectations as well. The management team is always on board looking for better ways to improve the team so that the team reflect their awesome management abilities."
good,This company no longer exist. Almost 1 year ago this company went out of business. I only worked for this company for 3 months in total before leaving.
good,"Before they started focusing on money on 2012, the company had promise. The sales were up and the associates focused on customer service. After a CEO change, commission structure changed, sales went down as an outcome"
good,Great Company to grow with.
good,"Helped customers, worked incustomer service mainly. check-out, returns, and exchanges on merchandise."
good,This was an awesome place to work and I learned a lot about electronics and sales during my time at hhgregg and if they didn't close down I would definitely still be employed there
good,It is a great place to work. The employees are driven to perform every single day. They are knowledgeable on the various tech and appliances found in the store.
good,Being into technology hhgregg was an obvious choice of employment. I learned a lot there as well as shown the path I wanted to take in my career choices.
good,"This job included doing paper work, checking customers out. This also included light sales duties. This included using computers as well. Great job overall."
good,"Hhgregg was a good place to work with while it was open. The relationships between all with staff was great. Sadly, all of their stores are closed now so this review isn't going to help anyone."
good,not really much to say about the company anymore... clearly them going out of business says something about how enjoyable it was to work for the company.
good,This was a good place to work and grow.   You would go in there and it seemed like you would learn a new thing every single day.  You would go in there and see great managers and great coworkers.
good,Learned the fundamentals required to engage a company through the human resources department. Working alongside senior level professionals allowed me to receive the fundamentals.
good,"Collect payments, answer phone calls, help customers with their returns or other questions they may have. Open all workstations, count cash drawers in the morning, when you are the closer shut down all work stations, count cash drawer and give your drop to the manager."
good,A commission base job that you made your own paycheck. The schedule was not very demanding and you also had time to spend with your family. Also could take advantage of store employee discounts.
good,"Friendly management, they make you feel welcomed there, and are always willing to help. It's a very calm and peaceful environment, and the workload is manageable."
good,This was a fun and busy place to work. I learned a lot in regards the the technical aspect of the product which helped me achieve sales goals set by the company and goals I set for myself.
good,Even though this was a seasonal job I was able to see how every worker is utilized and how they are integral in helping the business be successful.
good,"The pay was ok, benefits were pretty great, managers had no idea what they were doing and there was hardly any proper structure. Occasional free food was provided and there was an occasional meeting to provide information. Had daily ""morning meetings""but most of the time was spent fooling around..."
good,"Love working with the public, dealing with electronics and gadgets. Management was great"
good,"Very structured work environment."

I also learned how to assist individuals with merchandise that was suitable for their needs.  The management team was very helpful and understanding.  My co-workers were very supportive.  The hardest part of the job had to be maintaining the ""Draw"".  Draw determined your paycheck amount.  It was based upon what you should be making versus what you are making.  Selling enough merchandise to maintain this draw seemed almost impossible due to company conversion.  The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting appreciative customers with their needs and providing them with solutions that are available for them.  Overall I enjoyed the experience."

good,"Customer service oriented, Great staff, amazing management"
good,"At HHgregg my job is based on complete customer service first. If I take care of customers first and have a positive attitude I will be productive at work everyday. At HHhgregg after focusing on customers the next thing to do is make sure that the store looks good, making sure that everything is nice and straight. Working at HHgregg has showed me what customer service really means. I define customer service as not saying no but saying let me find out what I can do for customer. As far as management I have worked with every kind of manager you can think of. Some cared all about customer service, but some of them didn't know how to talk to there employees. There were some managers that talked down to some employees and some that talked down to customers, and I feel that with me seeing both sides of that I know what to say and what not to say to customers. A lot of my co-workers where really great to work with. I have nothing but respect for my co-workers, even when there where times when I bumped heads with them but they where great people. At first the hardest part of the jobs was keeping a postive attitude when talking to customers because there where so many different types of people and you just had to know how to talk to them. The most enjoyable part of the jib is getting to learn about all the new product, and being able to interact with the product. I always liked showing how to use the internet on the smart televisions."

good,"Every day I would come in at 9am and get all of the products ready (refrigerators, stoves, microwaves, beds, etc) and would be sure to read up on absolutely any new information that could be useful to my customers or myself. The job was 100% commission with no base rate pay, so you had to rely solely on what you sold to make income. I was the top salesperson almost every month employed, and took pride in my knowledge of every detail of every product. It was a lot of work, but it paid off. I would work one-on-one with customers to find the best product for them and for their lifestyle, and I was told numerous times that I was unlike every salesperson. I was knowledgeable, really listened to their wants and needs, and helped them however I could from every aspect. The most enjoyable part of the job was new customers coming in, asking for me personally because their friends or relatives had recommended me to help them find what they were looking for. I traveled to Chicago to train new employees for a grand opening, and I trained new employees at the Chillicothe location."
