rating,review
bad,Title says it all. Most problems stem from poor management on all levels. Some great people working here though........................................
bad,".Challenging to open minded with my experience."
bad,"Learned a great deal while working there about the industry as well as the processes. Great starting point in a young persons career path"
bad,Cutting Edge Technology. But this company has more lay-offs over the years that they hire. They tend to lean more towards out-sourcing to overseas than anything else
bad,"Low salary standard.stressfull,superior and subordinate problem.no team work.lack of benefit.low increase for yearly appraisal.company frquently reorg people if manaegement team."
bad,"Several significant reorganizations company-wide have taken place over the last 5 years. The latest reorg in  Oct 2014 moved directors and senior management into new roles across the company. Technology and segment groups were joined under general managers (new structure). Same reorg also resulted in significant layoffs (at least 10% of staff) and many teams have been understaffed in key areas. This paralyzed the company for at least 6 months.  According to rumors internally, requisitions are awaiting signature and hiring will start up again this fall (particularly in the product lines)."
good,"great company, but when you have 2 people doing the work of 1900 employees and you have no say and the management does not stand behind you, then there is a time to move on"
good,"They have a lot of time for meetings and it makes it difficult to get a lot of work completed. They are not very focused on primary objectives and the messaging is unclear, at times."
good,Company provides innovative projects to work on everyday. A lot of technical knowledge is contained in senior engineers.
good,Worked there for a few months and completed job tasks as asked.
good,A manufacturing company that requires employees to be trained and certified with all tools and equipment they are operating within their cell or lab. A clean room facility that requires clean room garments to be warned at all time.
good,"a variety of working time/schedule/shifting;"
good,"When I originally started at ADI in Nashua it was great! Then the confusion started. The floor leader did not train me as was expected, I have been there for 4 years now and am still being told not to do something, then told to do it, told to do it this way, then that way. I have so much confusion as to what I am suppose to do I no longer do anything without someone telling me. I am tired of being spoken too and told not to do something I was told to do yesterday."
good,"Was a fun and innovative place to work for many years. Now management is trying to be all things to all people, won't prioritize and properly staff initiatives. Random reorganizations, high-level people leaving or being pushed out."
good,"It's a laid back place. The CEO doesn't seem to know what to do with the company. He talks about moving into software, but just laid off 10% of the software engineers and abandoned hit IoT initiative. Most of the people over 57 were offered early retirement or laid off. Raises never exceed 3% and there is little opportunity for advancement, Every division is perpetual understaffed. While having a greater than 40% profit margin, the profit sharing and health insurance were reduced and vision benefits dropped entirely."
good,"Typical work place, good security, innovative, competitive resources, and good management system for a semiconductor company or wafer electronics."
good,"It used to be a wonderful place to work. It is too bad that things have changed. Analog is now just another company with short sighted management interested only in the stock price. Employees are now just another commodity. The company has performed layoffs in spite of the fact that it had plenty of cash and was not losing money. People are routinely apprehensive about the annual layoffs in the November/December timeframe. Because of this, a vicious competitive environment has been fostered where backstabbing is the norm done by people who mistakenly feel that it will make them more secure. It does, however, still offer one of the best 401K plans available."
good,I am happy working in analog devices but I working as contractor(direct contract) so i looking forward for permanent job.
good,Exceptional place to work; the culture of the individuals who work there take pride in a quality product. The most enjoyable part of the job is experiencing the final product.
good,"ADI is very good for those starting out in their careers to get oriented and has a lot of resources for networking and building one's engineering tool set.  The work/life balance is good and the pay is good enough."
good,"All the different people you get to work with, friends made for life. A learning experience nearly every day. Valuable skills learnt that will allow you to improve your work ability now and for the future."
good,"Over the years it has been a great place to work.  Historically, great benefits. ADI encourages movement within to round out skill sets and stay challenged."
good,Analog Devices was my first job out of college.  I worked on the manufacturing floor for almost a year before I moved into a new role.  I don't have much to say about the company culture because it has been so long since I've been there and at the time I had zero experience
good,I have not been with company for several years and since my tenure the company has gone through multiple reorgs and a significant merger. I left for a better opportunity. It is not ideal for a non-engineer (ADI is a very engineer-driven organization). Good family/work balance depending on the manager you report to. Somewhat political.
good,"The department of test manufacturing is not good. The culture in there is it always be the senior to be the 1st to be promoted or have the more power in talking. The culture is base on seniority which is not nice. Because there are some of the seniors is not capable of the work. "
good,this is a clean room and a understanding place to work. you deal with new tech and the people is always happy and the job is enjoyably not worry about stressing out too much

good,I was working here as an contract employee.Nice teamm role.Everyone is supportive but contract employees are not getting any benefits form the company
good,Bread and butter of company is from legacy products created in the 70s. Little innovation but friendly folks. Not for the ambitious but for folks simply looking for a decent job.
good,Challenging everyday. The most enjoyable thing at work is I get to see so many different people at work and have conversation with them. Interacting with all levels of management is a plus to.
good,Challenging workplace with the option to move freely between departments. Benefits package is very attractive however the salary could be better. There are not that many opportunities to progress up the ladder.
good,"I learned SCHEMATIC and PWORK to prepare detailed electrical and mechanical drawings for new product development.Create CAM files for a copper clipboard."
good,"Typical day at work is good, we have a good working environment."
good,"Small teams working on leading-edge tech products.  Strong R&D and leaders in the areas they play in, but little commitment to fight for market share in new areas.  They are good at creating new product categories."
good,Spændende job med mange udfordringer - der er aldrig 2 dage der er ens. Mulighed for at skabe sin egen hverdag.  Meget rejseaktivitet. Få kollegaer med ledelse i UK.
good,"ADI was a very good place to work.The people that I worked with in San Jose made it worth coming to work every day."
good,"okay, free coffee and parking. Grey ceiling doesn't let younger workers move ahead."
good,"Challenging company, highly collaborative, smart people, innovative but a bit too risk averse, slow in decision-making - too many analysis. In the middle of an integration, so it's a bit chaotic there now. You have to be able to deal with ambiguity. Some weak leaders at the top."
good,"Analog Devices is a member of EICC (Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition), a code of conduct establishes standards to ensure that working conditions in the electronic industry are safe, that workers are treated with respect and with dignity."

good,Fast paced company with room for growth from within the company. Management lets you work and instills confidence in your abilities. Hardest part of the job can be the long hours at times.
good,In vielen Bereichen flexibler und fairer Arbeitgeber.
good,"Good place to work, management at times do not work well between workcentres, however recent upgrades within company have seen imporvements in this area"
good,"A lot of great, smart engineers who are open and willing to discuss problems that come up in your circuits.  Our group is all about power electronics."

good,People is great. It has a decent work/life balance. But Management and compensation needs improvement.
good,"I have spent almost 6 years working as a operator in a state-of-the-art wafer fabrication facility in Ireland. Overall i find my experience very good. People i have worked with, culture at work, bonuses, salary.All this things were very good. The only thing which was hard is that i had to work both dayshift and nightshift."

good,"Analog Devices is a great place for entry level production applicants.."
good,"A typical day of work, I meet with the Team Lead (TL) and with other technical guys, communicate with the end users and other project stake holders with regards to the progress/status of the project and document each stage of the software development.  The means of communicating with the project team and end users in terms of passing documents is through email, printed documents being routed or through Skype Instant Messaging.  Part of my job is to analyze the requirements, build/code/test new applications/software.   I deploy the applications to the test server in the IIS and Database and then the testing is done my TL is the one that deploy the applications to the Production Server.  Before the buy off by the users the web apps have to undergo end to end testing from my side as the developer to the test to be made by the end users of the applications."
good,"Good place to work but could improve on the work life balance on the 5 cycle shift. After a 12 hr shift you have little or no time or energy for family or hobbies while on shift. That said because of the shift there is good time off between shifts."

good,"Analog devices have good projects, work, and opportunities. Management is encouraging and friendly. Overall it is a good company to start your career if you want to enter semiconductor industry."
good,I enjoyed working at Hittite/Analog Devices.  The people I worked with were professional and shared their experience and knowledge.  Unfortunately like most large semiconductor companies they have moved the majority of their manufacturing to offshore locations.  I think it is a great place for good engineers.
good,It was a very good place to work.  The company was constantly changing and being adapted to the newest technology.  It was nice to be exposed to these changes and be adapted to them.
good,"Good place to hone your skills, down side there are many people in the same organization so a lot of over lap. Not a very good training program"

good,"A great and organize Managements."
good,"Analog is a great semiconductor company with some really good managers who act as mentors as much as directing tasks.  My only complaint (as of 2004) was the pay.  They figured bonus and stock options as part of the package, but both were very unreliable over the 6 years I worked there"
good,"I enjoyed working with Analog Devices as HR Administrator. I've been exposed to different aspects of HR e.g. Benefits, Employee Relations etc. The knowledge and skills learned everyday cannot be discounted because Analog has a healthy working environment where we are asked to speak out and re-engineer our own processes. Trainings tha t has been provided was excellent. The Management has played a very effective role by building transparency in the organization. For someone who enjoy working in this organization, I don't have to work a day because it is really fun working with the team. The only thing that really made me decide to quit is the fact that headcount is limited and I have to work as Temporary. The most enjoyable part is that every effort is being recognized and appreciated."
good,Great company for young people getting the foot in the door. Overall management was weak.
good,"There's a lot of room for pushing the scope of the job and gaining additional skills and responsibilities. For example, when I started, there was no program for energy management and procurement. I was able to secure and purchase natural gas contracts directly from the suppliers to achieve cost savings."
good,Management and workplace culture are top notch. Job was enjoyable in the sense that the managers are working towards a clear goal and focus on developing people.
good,Managers are very approachable and understanding.  The work environment is fairly relaxed and the people are very professional. Plenty of opportunity for growth.

I continually feel like work matters and makes a global impact. Lots of opportunity for growth and diversity of responsibilities."

I learned a lot of things from simpliest to hardest work and even to learned the best technique to simply my works."
good,"As an intern, I learned a lot about how the semiconductor industry works from designing certain IC schematics.
