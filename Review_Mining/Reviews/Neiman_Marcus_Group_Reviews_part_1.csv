rating,review
bad,"They have no management training, they do not care about their employees.  The work environment was terrible.  I was there 4 years and they never did anything for their employees.  I've worked for companies, that was always helping your grow, this company does nothing to help in anyway."
bad,Seasonal Work From Home is great to make holiday funds. Working from home is the only great experience about working for Neiman Marcus. The trainers are great.
bad,The job was ok during holiday season and then they started sending me on very long extended lunch breaks up to 3 hrs unpaid plus sending me home early. It was a waste of gas going up there I was not working the hours promised to me
bad,"Neiman Marcus pride themselves on providing there customers with exceptional customer service but treat there employees with such disrespectl. Needs to update computers and provide better training. Upper mangements are terrible.     "
bad,"This company has a lot of issues. From MGT to staff, this company runs based off of ""popularity"" contests.  The company recognizes those who don't do much, because the MGT Staff has their favorites."
bad,This is not a place to make a career because they are backstabbers.They want you to work hard to make bonuses for them and little or no raises for you
bad,"This company has been doing this the way that they have for over 50 years and sees no need to change anything. It is concerning how when a great company starts to look at profits more than their people, and things start to fall apart, the only change is sporadic and illogical. This created even more chaos."
bad,"I worked there for 2 years.  It was the most miserable job I have ever had.  Management was a joke.  No career advancement, clickish, backstabbing, no pay raises, constant harrassment and discrimination.  Your mental health is worth more than that.  Please skip this place."
bad,"Written up for everything, lots of cliques and brown nosing. Did my job, kept to myself and still got dragged into drama of others. Worse than being homeless"
bad,"Working for Neiman Marcus was my dream job. Unfortunately, it is a toxic place to work.  No room for advancement, deterred from learning, very poor compensation, very poor management, too many issues to list. Very sad..."
bad,Poor management and high school work environment. Supervisor was a jerk My manager was great. The supervisor felt like he was the manager and HR. Wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to work here.
bad,"Too much mess, I was called a racial slur by a employee , she was fired, but my mind never got back to work balance. I did not like it way too my favortism, people standing around doing nothing but still had good prodution"
bad,"I have worked other retail jobs before, neiman marcus last call was by far the worst job I have ever had. We were always short staffed and never had enough coverage on the floor. The work is too much for the amount that we were paid. It was a very toxic environment. The customers were terrible. Management was horrible. I never felt backed up by management. Working here made me quit retail for the rest of my life."
bad,Very impatient and unwilling to train. Schedule is demanding and it is very difficult to change a schedule. Very demanding and inconsiderate supervising.  Very disappointed
bad,This is a horrible place to work they don't train you very well and the things that you don't know you asked about they expect for you to know they don't care about their employees just what you can get done for them they lie about the hours they'll give you and the workload when there is no work load they either constantly ignore youyou or send you home early
bad,"It seems great at first. But the greed on the floor that management encourages is toxic and depressing. "
bad,"They humiliate they're associated, they yell at employees.  Very competitive, very hostile, fake, gossip and more. I do not recommend working in there to any of my friends and family."
bad,"Neiman Marcus is outsourcing its Customer Service jobs to other countries to save money, thereby providing a lower caliber of care to customers, and not taking care of long time employees or being forthright."
bad,"It's hit or miss with a high chance of missing as to if you'll enjoy or hate working there. The majority of departments have terrible managers, who treat their workers horribly, and the small number of departments that have great management, are hard to get into."
bad,"Long hours, little pay, high expectations. That is how I can describe working at Neiman Marcus. You are not nearly compensated for the work you do and put in. The person above you always gets credit and there is no room for advancement."
bad,"would never recomend working with diminishing sales, all going to internet sales with several people resigning due to failing commissions and continuous loss of sales to outside entities."
bad,"Unprofessional place to work for, everything is unorganized. The management is terrible and have favorite employees who they donâ€™t penalize for anything."
bad,"Terrible company culture. Overworked with out moral/monetary appreciation. Awfully structured business model. HR department may as well be nonexistent. "
bad,Political and lack of structure including respect for an individual. When issues came up they would sweep under the rug. Training was not present during my time
bad,"Micro management, cut throat, watch cctv and employees. Most of the time its drug dealers that come in spending their money. Low life's within the store. Cant make a stop unless you are cleared to do so by micro manager in charge. Please avoid this place. Complete was of time. Look elsewhere. They will lie to your face."
bad,"Horrible work enviornment and I would advise everyone to stay far away from corporate ( I can't speak on what working in stores is like). Corporate offices are filled with Caddy and unfriendly (mostly women) who lack basic human decency. Everyone is looking to get ahead and is in it for themselves. Management does not listen and the room for growth is almost non-existent. Favoritism is a BIG issue and flat out rudeness and disrespect can be expected daily. Employees are underpaid and over worked. If you are a coordinator, you will not receive sick pay and will be forced to come in sick."
bad,"this was the most depressing place to work, they treat the employees badly there. I really don't miss working there at all Saks was a better fit for me until HBC bought the company"
bad,"Really terrible."
bad,"People don't get along with each other and everyone works on commission and needs to make over $10,000 to meet their quota and not get fired. My department manager lied to loss prevention saying that I had kept a client's information in my mailbox for a pre-sale. When in reality she allowed me to take that information and she kept it in her office. I lost my job and she was promoted to a higher Department with more money."
bad,"Upscale retail clothing store, has alt of name brand products. Online orders  are as important as self shoppers, all has to on time or referred to other store if out of stock.Put customer first, strife to stratify customers, very expenses."
bad,"It is straight commission with horrible return policy. MEANING, when your customer brings back merchandise to return you pay back the commission you made on that. Mind you, most merchandise are brought back after its used. Plus, it takes an hour and more to close a sell, so when it comes back its like you worked for nothing. Not a fair company to work for, only name."
bad,It is such a mess of a job.  Not to mention that buisness is so slow.  You spend more time staring off than selling or anything else.  Your day drags.
bad,"Typical day at work included opening the store, making a morning sheet which was often wrong because of the information that HR provided you with, arming/disarming alarms, handing out keys, stamping associates purchases. This job is not challenging whatsoever. The policy we had to follow to catch a shoplifter were so strict that we would never be able to apprehend anyone. Upper management was absolutely pitiful. The operations manager here at Palo Alto had been working for NM for 38 years (Yeah that's right 38 years), yet he knew absolutely nothing about how to operate this store. He was constantly referring back to the Assistant Loss Prevention Manager (Who is easily the most valuable associate at the store). We were so short staffed towards the end of my tenure that we were opening and closing the store by ourselves (7am-8:30pm), often times without breaks because upper management didn't answer their phones. This place will be a great fit for people who want to deal with incompetent upper management,, constantly overworked, as well as being underpaid. If you don't see yourself enjoying these few things, I would suggest looking anywhere else for a minimum wage job."
bad,Although working at Neiman Marcus Fashion Island was ultimately a dream job for me I was greatly disappointed with the work invireonment. It lacks good management and the work space is very cut-throat. It is a great experience and very quick-paced.
bad,Not a great place to work. Sold a dream that they did not deliver on. It was great in the beginning but soon found out management does not care about their employees success.
bad,"Management is not consistent,  no steady sales (customer traffic very low) and therefore pay is very inconsistent as well. Work hours are long and employees work weekends and holidays. There is no upward mobility and a lot of turnover. Returns affect commissions."
bad,"They use people to their advantage. You come in and do your job if you finish quickly, you are sent home for there is nothing else for you to do. you might work 2 hours a day or 8 depending on whether they need you"
bad,"slave work. slow except for holidays. not much work to be done in store besides cleanup. Over staffed. Repetitive work! long hours! work break, very few! pay was horrible. no benefits, part time hours never promoted, because management is full and doesn't seem to want to leave. always hiring young staff who leave within a month. everyone wanted to leave as soon as they could. staff continued to not care about display and tags and mixed items everywhere"
bad,"I worked there for over 3 years. It was great when I first started, but then the company started to reorganize and it was downhill from there. They are nit picky and concentrate way to much energy on picking on lower employees, instead of correcting major issues that would help the company and employees as a whole. They have many system issues, and they will blame on you, if you work from home. The calls come in back to back and as a supervisor, you still have to take calls from customers, which is one of the changes they've made. Insurance is expensive and not very good. You pay 100% for everything except physicals."
bad,"Lowest paying warehouse in the area for all the BS that you have to put up with.  This was by far the worst job I ever had. It was a production warehouse but pay was only $9.50/hr.  All warehouse associates only got a 30-minute lunch while supervisors, managers and all office associates got an hour for lunch.  We were lied to almost daily and once a month we had those Employee of the Month assemblies where management pretended to care about you.  I am so glad that I do not work here anymore.  Would not recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked at, would not recommend to anyone. Hours are unsteady, work is very physical, you are forced to go into different departments even when your not trained for the department and you only make 10.00 an hour."
bad,"Why is a company that has no hours for current employees, hiring new employees. Abused and mistreated.  No respect.  Horrible work environment and customer base.  False reviews submitted to corporate. Unfair compensation.  Management lies to employees and does not treat employees with respect.  Backstabbing manager."
bad,Only worked this job shortly after Saks closing-very critical management with even the shipping manager getting involved with selling. Moved to Norrdstom.
bad,Neiman Marcus  did not work for me . I had problem contacting  him after my assignment no response to went i need to do next. They had me still employed with them i ask what do i do for you all they did not no anything.
bad,"I spent 10 years trying to keep my head above water. No matter how well you do, the next goal will be higher.  In a commission only environment it's impossible to obtain every unrealistic fantasy goal management created. The return policy was a nightmare and our paychecks suffered from it. Management was ruthless and heartless.  They had steady paychecks and zero understanding for how hard it could be to try and sell in a company that never had enough stock on hand. I've seen multi million dollar books have anxiety and panic attacks due to the pressure put on them. Managers telling us which vendors to push and sell so they can make their bonus. Not approving schedule requests or vacations if you didn't make them happy. If you want to never know what your paycheck will be and thrive on being only as valuable as your numbers are then this is sadly the place for you."
bad,"I can find nothing good to say about NM LastCall. Well there were a few people that were ok to work with. This is a pit stop job. Used. Abused. Ignored. Favoritism. No benefits. No growth. Teenagers may like it. Adults, RUN!"
bad,continual loss of commission while management promotes on line purchasing diminishing ability to earn based on sales
bad,This was a high stress job with very high stress staff. The compensation was not worth the over all job itself. This is no some place to create a career.
bad,"The location of Neiman Marcus that I worked at had by far the most unprofessional, suppressing upper management team(in store) that I have ever worked under. I am sure that some employees do thrive with this company, however, this location is extremely depressing and seems to have a very high turn over rate."
bad,I despise this job. Phones are ringing off the hook constantly and majority it is complaints about the company. Bad employees mess up deliveries and then I have to fix that . I get yelled at by entitled rich people all day. Some customers are nice but everyone else wants to degrade you. I apologize and the common line used is. I don't want your apology it's not my problem you messed up so fix it. Assist doesn't help with anything and tells you to look in the portal and your TM just wants to make sure you're working. I was happy before I worked here and now I dread picking up the phone. No real assistance for employees that feel abused by customers as you can't hang up or tell customer that due to their behavior the conversation is over. So take punches and get yelled at.
bad,"Neiman Marcus was one of the worst company's I had ever worked for, I worked here years ago but when I did I was grateful to at least have a job but the pay, benefits, and the work environment was horrible!! It was also very clear that the warehouse employees were treated differently, glad I left when I did because I would never see myself advancing in this company in any way!"
bad,"nothing to say, worst place to work, store manager has some serious  issues, bad hours, bad pay, no respect for workers, benefits are ok, perks are that its so dead you can walk around and get personal stuff done because its the same customers all day"
bad,go in do your day to day assignment the less information about yourself as possibly there is nonthing confidential
bad,"I love working at a fast pace. Working here was so fun, I got to meet different people every day."
bad,"I worked as an OST member at the Chicago Michigan Avenue location for several years where the percentages of Inventory stats where never good enough, Management had terrible communication, and no consideration of team suggestions to improve the system whatsoever. Employees, both stock and sales, were treated terribly and a false sense of morale was always pushed at weekly meetings to create the illusion that the management was actually being productive."
bad,"You can bust your butt, get all the stats in the world, destroy previous years accomplishes and still not get a raise.  They promise you that they promote from within, but they do not.  I was located at a store with 5 LP Investigators.  2 got fired because of a bad stop, 2 more quit because of horrible management and the way that they were treated by superiors.  I was by myself for 3 months before the company decided to hire anyone else.  Then I was expected to train these people (who had no experience in LP before) and still do every bit of work for the entire 5 person staff on my own.  For 6 months I did all the work of the ASM / Ops Manager, all audits and safety requirements and still given no appreciation.  I was lead to believe (by getting false promises from not only store management, but corporate management) that I would receive a promotion because of my excellent track record and ability to basically do 6 people's jobs by myself.  Did that happen?  No.  In fact, when the company hired a new ASM/Ops Mgr they started to force me out because that particular person wanted to bring in his own team.  So, where is the family/team atmosphere?  Non existent.  Further more, I had 7 internal investigations (Associate Thefts) that were well documented and clear as day.  But because the company has no backbone or ounce of integrity, they would not touch the terminations.  They did not even interview these individuals.  "
bad,"Terrible HR, Terrible work environment, Terrible engagaement, terrible pay."
bad,"Over all the associates at this location work hard, are friendly for the most part and work well with each other. I was hired as a Loss Prevention Investigator when the Job title should have been ""Operations Specialist"" I was quick to find out that the position was more focused on operations than theft resolution.  Almost five months with the company and not a single shoplifter because they didn't want to certify newly hired lp. On weekends instead of LP being focused on theft prevention the assistant manager rather you work in receiving processing shoes for a big event.  Never mind the fact that if the women's manager and assistant manager don't like you, they will work together to find any reason to terminate you. The assistant manager lacks Loss Prevention knowledge and is not really LP oriented.  This specific location has a different style of training; computer generated training and because you have precious LP they expect you to know everything so you find yourself training your self at times because your training manger (the assistant store manager) has to outsource for answers.  So, if you don't like to catch shoplifters, you Love to process merchandise, you ENJOY handing out keys for associates and validating their everyday purchases then this is the job for you.  How ever, if you enjoy catching shoplifters, and internal investigations, this is not the Job for you.  You report to someone who lacks field loss prevention experience and lacks basic knowledge such as for example ; the password to their camera system. Wich out of pure luck a non member of management found."
bad,"Seasonal job no benefits, just temp work. Direct Hire. I am rehirable and would go back to make extra money"
bad,"Was fine till I needed emergency surgery. Had to miss time and when I came back, I was hauled to HR. Do not get sick. If you do they will find a way to fire you."
bad,"With a corporate setup of the Support Staff in complete opposition with the Sales Staff, for the sake of remote-order fulfillment, getting work done isn't just a headache for both sides of the equation, it's nearly impossible, and no side wins. Then add in a bullying Director, to whom rules don't apply,  backstabbing management who think only of themselves, and will throw anyone under the bus in the blink of an eye, and you have yourself a work environment that is totally unbalanced, highly stressful, and emotionally unhealthy. "
bad,"standing all day with untrained leads,no benefits bad attitudes"
bad,"Not a good work environment. The culture there was very skewed, and the compensation is awful."
bad,"Was hired as a stock associate part-time 30hrs per week to set up new store location in Rosemont Il.Was never trained in any aspects of the receiving area,and was scheduled only one day a week after the store was open.Was told by management if I was not available to work  sales floor and fitting room I should start looking for another job.Let's just say I no longer work there.Very clique like work atmosphere among the management,they were very rude and unprofessional."
bad,helped the customers put orders and take payments online from the customers
bad,"The job is easy or the most part, but they do not treat the employee like more than a trained monkey. God forbid you have an emergency and you need to leave, no matter what is, even if you are bleeding all over their facility, it will count against you. Over-time... forget about it."
bad,"Workplace - did not feel welcome. "
bad,Awful treatment of employees. Management is discouraging at best. Ancient company with ancient practices that don't translate at all in the modern workforce. Run far away if you want a fulfilling job with room for learning and growth.
bad,"They divide employees into seval classes, favor and spoil some of them and give them special treatment, but discriminate some others who even have to have more stressful work load than those favor ones.  "
bad,"Employees that are commission-only are ordered to do all kinds of side work that takes them off the floor for hours every day to save the company money from hiring those needed people. Ridiculous return policy...customer has the run of the store at the employees expense. I averaged $400,000 in returns per year, which was subtracted from my check even though I spent hours of my time with these customers that are allowed to return anything after they have used it and kept for as long as they want. Online returns is the other nightmare. If you work near any parking lot you will have a line of returns all day long prohibiting you from selling or servicing any customers you may already be helping. These online people have no receipts which creates a huge drain on your time (no commission, neglecting your existing custy), they want alterations which can take another hour of your time (no commission. Oddly management sees no issue with you loosing your selling time. With that said, the company is continually being sued by its employees."
bad,As a Senior Executive it was a lot of games being played and employees suffered from these games. Not an environment I would wish on anyone. Never seen a company not focused on their employees.
bad,"WARNING: You wonder why a company of this magnitude is losing so much money? It all starts from the top."
bad,"I worked in a (Good Dish) Palette Restaurant as Server Assistant. The manager of this restaurant is very unprofessional, rude and unfair. It's a very stressful place to work."
bad,"A disaster waiting to happen.  This company is going downhill fast.  Merchandise is so overpriced.  The term ""Needless Markup"" couldn't be more true.  Wouldn't be surprised if the company goes under within the next five years."
bad,"Typical day for me was managed by me. I did all the merchandising "
bad,The management team was horrible when I was there and had very obvious favorites. The worst was the store manager and the women's department manager. Absolutely awful. The women's department manager is unstable and is rude to college students because she didn't further her education.
bad,"i felt like i was back in high school with the way i was treated, if you are not in favor with the upper management they would not help. i constantly had to go to my supervisor with issues on one particular co worker who would not do anything, would disappear to talk with their mother who also worked for the company instead of doing the job they were getting paid to do. There was always so drama some crisis that happened. it really felt like the company did not care at all about how the company was running. i could not understand how a high end retail job that had such a great reputation could be so unprepared, coordinated, unhelpful, and uncaring. I was totally put off by everyone i met and interacted with."
bad,"Neiman Marcus' working atmosphere is very cut throat, due to 100% commission pay. Their is no team effort to achieve ones goals. Sales people will lie and cheat to get a sale. Management does not assist you at all and they are terrible when it comes to customer service. They will not assist you in increasing your sales, or give you advise, they just criticize everything you do. I worked their 10 years and the company is going downhill quickly with their clientele and sales force."
bad,"Core values of the company seemed great when I frist started, then they used and abused with many hours and no appreciation. Instead with working 60+ hour weeks, you were told you arent doing good enough or find something they didnt like instead if a 'thank you' or 'good job'. Also, do not have much care for their employees. the ECDC in pittston pa is horrific."
bad,The Job can not accommodate your life outside of Neimans they want do not give credit to workers when deserved
bad,"Reading emails, and answering voice mails,"
bad,-Long hours
bad,If you get in good with the managers your fine. Because manager run the store. Their favoritism is known. Get used to working weends and holidays. Neiman Marcus talks about family but they are really talking about customers families and managers are the only one who can have a life. Doing thing the wrong was is accepted as a good job. Doing the job right and safe is frowned upon. Your hours change from day to day and week to week. i'm glad I moved on when I did. Managers are stuck up and it makes working there very hard.
bad,"Undercutting hostile behavior among coworkers is norm supported & modeled by management. Outdated systems and inadequate inventory. No reason to visit store, items commonly out of stock so they have to be shipped anyway. Aging out customer base with no clue how to modernize. Far below average compensation. Constant confusion as to what the ""policy"" is today."
bad,Retail sales have given way to on-line sales.  Reduction of on hand inventory makes it very difficult to service customers as their needs are immediate.  There are constant fluctuations in policy in order to make a sale that are not properly discussed from the main source.
bad,"Miserable environment. Dishonesty, unethical practices encouraged. At times it is a lot of fun, many friendly coworkers and clients as well.  The morning fashion shows and meetings were amazing."
bad,"Their labor management system is a joke, they play favorites with workers, if you ask for a day off more then likely you wonâ€™t get it, they cut your hours so you canâ€™t pay your bills, they will write you up for any reason they even make up reasons to write you up, will do anything to deny you a raise and if they cant deny you a raise then they look for reasons to fire you..."
bad,"Awful place to work. Don't believe the pipe dream they'll give you.  Because of their ""draw system"", you can basically work for free. Almost everything you sell will get returned because of their ""60-day return policy"" co-workers are hit and miss, as some are sharks. HR is a joke that lacks any sheer sign of empathy or compassion."
bad,"Interesting that anything happens on the sales floor their LP team blames a sales associate and then they get rid of that employee because someone has to pay back, so LP gets away from getting in trouble. The managers have their favoritism and so some employees get away with a lot of things."
bad,Not the best place to work. Catty environment. No incentives given for hard work. Favoritism place a major role there. I would love to have been apart of the Neiman Marcus culture. Very difficult when working under certain management.
bad,"Store Manager bipolar, one day happy next day nasty, she has 2 faces, she has her favorite employees that can do whatever they want,  she is not fair, cursing all the time, very unprofessional. At first she offered me a lead position,  and a full time job,  after a year she told me that I will not be a Lead anymore an cut my hours from 36 to 29 per week."
bad,The Lead selling position is nothing more then a glorified sales associate with no power to do one job. Store management  lacks many skills such as people and professionalism.  Asst. Manager will always question other associates to finding information on other associates.
bad,Working at Neiman Marcus Last Call Studio isn't a hard job. There isn't room for growing within the company because of them cutting Full Time & Part time positions. You're best bet is to stick it out for a year in order to transfer to a full line position.
bad,"Run away. Not what the leading company it used to be. Unfortunately, the growth has outpaced its people practices. Poor corporate leadership decisions have lead to company wide lay-offs, a new corporate system fabled to bring wide-eyed view of sales only left everyone blind, a company debt larger than its assets, now they look to hire part time staff to avoid offering insurance benefits. This once solid company is on shaky ground. They carry products similar to Saks, but operate like a Kmart."
bad,Its an okay job if you like being fake and acting like management is doing their job just fine. The amount of disrespect is so nasty.
bad,"Once I had great admiration for Neiman Marcus, not anymore. If you hire on, you better be prepared for this, just in case. Should you consider advancing into sales, be prepared, you will take an assessment test, you must pass or you are at a dead end. They will let you take it again in one year. So many unhappy associates that could not pass this trick assessment test with 93 questions."
bad,When you start the job they are friendly towards you.Soon after  you are then Verbally told on a daily basis that your personal life is secondary to the Company.If there are Hardships outside of the workplace the company comes first.Co-workers are pleasant to work with.The hardest part of the job is no matter how good of an employee you are you know your days are numbered in staying there.There is no job security
bad,All I can say is there's a problem when the CEO'S and higher VP's are all jumping ship.
bad,"neimans is very unclear on what direction they should go as a company.  No chance to move up. no return policy, great discount. "
bad,"Management doesn't support individual development and growth. They don't recognize extra effort, initiative, and loyalty.The culture just caters to the rich and top sellers. The yearly evaluation is ridiculous and not based on performance. Don't stay longer than you need to. Good fashion and good service can be found in other stores."
bad,Company never listens to their employees. Even though the business is customer service driven. They have very bad standers for emplyees and create a hostile envoriment. Like some associates working on straight commission which sucks when their are having a bad sale day. Products specialist ( Cosmetics & Fragrance) area must still be accountable for selling while associates looks at them with dismay because they are on a salary. Store manager is races and have her favorites. Just a very bad environment.
bad,The manager over shipping is a very difficult to work with when thing don't go his way and will make up lies to get you fired. As well as the supervisor in shipping have no clue of how to run his area. Will make you do ten different jobs in one day but never fully complete them. But tell human resources that he can't locate you half the time. It will be a great place to work if those who like to micromanage knew their job.
bad,"When it's peak season, you can can get over 40 hours and overtime.  After January,  the hours get cut to 4 or 6 hours a day.If you are lucky to get to transfer to another department, you can get your hours then."
bad,"Was bullied by my managers and they kept telling me to apply for another job out of the company. I always voiced my opinion to HR and HR would support the managers instead of the employees. "
bad,"Productivity is all they care about and don't get fooled by anything else. You stand all shift long, use your hands and wrist doing very repetitive tasks till they might get damaged, easy to grab heavy totes which are not labeled and hurt your self. They don't have workmens comp they send you to their own doctors."
bad,"waste of time , not moving anywhere in that company . does not care about there employees. its like working with high school children. Bosses don't know how to do there job."
bad,This job is about managing your time meeting deadlines accomplishing your work goals. Meeting customer demand customer service. Shipping out boxes timely manner
bad,"The high turnover rate is due to lack of diversity, the who you know not what you know mentality, and unprofessionalism.  A management team that doesn't care makes for a hostile environment and a horrible work environment.  They receive good outstanding positive employees and do not know how to train and/or retain them."
bad,"Too much politics in career advancement. Unfair place to work. A typical day at work involves managers giving orders to the sales team to meet sales goals. Creativity and outside the box thinking is greatly discouraged, and there is too much pressure to abide by the managers rules. The managers make different rules almost everyday making it difficult to identify what is the standard code. "
bad,Terrible place to work for! Occasionally dealing with rude customers is nothing in comparison to daily harassment and abuse from management. For them you are nothing more then a cheap labor which they can easily replace.
bad,"I was sought out by this organization for my background in leadership, finance, and compliance.  I didn't apply for my role, I was recruited.  "
bad,"If you donâ€™t make your annual personal sales  goal by as little as $1.00, youâ€™re gone. No joke."
bad,"Employees are under paid for the work done, the company is now out sourcing out of the country so your hours are not guaranteed be cause the could be given to the outsourced agents if it is too slow."
bad,"Low pay, DRAMA, racial competition encouraged. Just rediculouse place to work for anyone over 30. I thought I was going to work for a solid company with moral character. When I found there was no escaping or correcting the wrongful and unlawful way they run things..... I left."
bad,"The management team is a popularity contest, very unprofessional, very inappropriate, company overall makes huge cuts and lets long lasting employees go frequently. Visuals have no experience and no work ethic. Overall store feeling to outside customers is stuck up and rude employees. i would never suggest anyone to work shop or eat there."
bad,I personally had a bad experience with Nieman Marcus due to my managers making the job I had harder than it needed to be by not being upfront with their teams on what they needed
bad,"The Sales associates are old ( over 50) jealous of new staff and try to gang against them , always there's some kind of conspiracy going on to get rid of the new young staff ,it's like Mafia ."
bad,"Should have an awesome GM where hard work pays off and details are important. Now, mediocrity, complacency and downright apathy gets awards! You have some of the most hardworking associates who have such incredible job knowledge being overlooked! In this store the focus is not about the affluent client anymore... the ones that continue to shop are served primarily by the personal shoppers. They are extremely stressed. Some management are very weak and itâ€™s unknown how they keep their jobs. Used to be a well-oiled machine! Not anymore."
bad,"You hear the name Neiman Marcus and the initial thought is top shelf. Maybe at the full line stores, but Last Call is a disaster. Ineptitude at corporate is overwhelming. My operations manager was unable to train me at my job because she was not properly trained in hers. I hold on to hope that things will improve. Here is the irony. I have always wanted to work for a privately owned company. Now that I am at one I wish there were shareholders for leadership to be accountable to."
bad,"Working on the parking lot level you handle all the returns for the entire store and ALL the online returns when you are supposed to be selling to earn straight commission ONLY. They overstaff this area for the multitude of nonstop returns due to a ""return anything whenever you feel like it policy.""  This causes a great turnover in staff because they cannot survive financially. This lack of policy really hurts my sales. Anything that is returned on you comes right out of your next paycheck. I loose $25,000/yr in income due to liberal return policy. This is work I have already done!!! I have earned this money and they take it away!!! On many days you are working for free, or you OWE the company because you did not sell enough to get over all your returns. They allow customers to wear and use everything the store sells and then return it for a full refund! The customers are fully aware and take full advantage of this, most not realizing that we work for commission only. A great discount is not a benefit if you are living paycheck to paycheck. Employees drop like flies."
bad,They are slow I donâ€™t have time for them nomo need to be I need more hours I have a baby an have  bills I need more money time to with my son they just need more help
bad,"I worked at the location in Tyson's Corner Mall with the job title of stylist. Many of my co-workers could not tell the difference between fake designer items and real ones despite working along side brands such as DVF and Alice +Olivia. The stylist position is Cusp's version of a sales associate, but don't tell the staff.  A typical day at work consisted of dressing mannequins and the occasional customer. The store is always clean, and the backroom is organized nicely. The customer's are typically friendly and outgoing. Pay is hourly plus a small commission percentage. Management is professional (for the most part). Co-workers, on the other hand, need help with the fashion industry allusions that developed from their job titles. "
bad,"This company allows you to work from home, the training is self taught so you learn everything on your own. The managers never were available for me when needed,"
bad,"I was so excited to work at this company but greatly disappointed. Management never cared about there employees especially when it comes to training. So the employees were always lost and we had to train ourselves. Management are horrible, we would complain but they would lie to cover up and they would take their side. The new current manager was more at the desk must of the time, leaving everything last minute, would never listen to his employee ideas or suggestion. Some people at OST are very miserable, and complaining about eachother. My own manager would even talk bad about me with coworkers. The only benefit about working at this company is the people at other department are very friendly and loving."
bad,"I am a big fan of great customer service and just a peaceful environment. Neiman Marcus made me feel like i was in high school again, it was too caddy if you're a girl thats going to be stressful. It is commission so everyone is very competitive but not in a fun way. The managers show favoritism, just not a good experience at all."
bad,"good coworkers"
bad,My overall experience with Neiman Marcus was very postive. The company strongly assists its workers to achive excellence.
bad,"This company hired me knowing they would be closing the store within a year. Horrible people to work for, the worst experience in my entire career. HR allowed this, shameful to do that to people."
bad,"Intimidating place with some racism specially among some of the people who have been there the longest, Leadership is very weak. No clear model on where to go next and bring business back."
bad,Complicated security systems were being thrown together in bad configuration due to management without knowledge on how to run a SOC or implement policy and procedures.
bad,"I learned how to handle all customer situations while working in a diverse environment. It has provided me a full understanding of basic retail concepts like selling, advising customers, visual merchandising and loss prevention."
bad,"Taking customers orders, trying to do suggestive selling, there was not a difficult part, but the best part was helping customers"
bad,Unusual culture- many employees a challenge to work with. You MUST be aggressive in your sales techniques to survive here. It is critical that you enter with a book of clientele as it is virtually impossible to gain new customers that will be loyal.
bad,"you were left alone if you did your job,you knew what was expected of you.you learned something about the buisness every day.management was not great,but ok.co-workers were fun and great to be around.the hardest part of job was standing all day,but it was ok.most enjoyable were the hours,you went to work early,but got off early."
bad,"Extensive, long, and laborious online application system that fails half way through the process. Very discouraging and disheartening."
bad,"I had worked at Neiman Marcus for about 6 months literally building the store from the ground up and in the beginning I had hope that things would be great. Weeks into working there I noticed things may not pan out the way that I had imagined. I immediately began to feel unappreciated, invisible, and improperly trained if trained at all."
bad,Retail schedule sucks and is unrealistic for a real life. I will never opt for a position in retail by choice again. The people are pompous and the pay sucks.
bad,"Can not make appointments, because you never know when you are going home. poorly managed, Can totally understand why they are in trouble. There treatment of their warehouse workers are terrible, Have no respect and treated like a low class citizen.  If only the corporate knew!!!! Or maybe corporate is behind it.Also the temps are paid more than the employees.  Beware!!!! "
bad,management is terrible treat their employee unfair hope you never get hurt they treat you horrible
bad,"Sad to say but NM has lost its glory that once ranked it amongst the best places to work. Gone are the days when management (especially at this location) understood and appreciated the teams they led. Today, save for a few worthy individuals, the leadership has gone to the dogs, despite having exceptional sales associates."
bad,"Lack of hours, Low pay, Mangers have no education or leadership skills. If you can stay on the ship long enough you'll get a chance to be captain. The company wants you to go above and beyond but treats you like dirt and pay you pennies. A joke of a call center. No associates are in the call center and the ones that work at home are monitored. Whats the sense of working from home if your tied to a leash."
bad,"Easy place to work but low pay and no hope to move up, I graduated with BA and I apply  for a management position and their response was, not qualify, that I had no experience. After 6 years working for them and no appreciation for anything, it is just not worth it."
bad,No job security. Big corporation business model. No career advancement. Retail is a failing industry and shoppers are much smarter. No customer traffic.
bad,"The HR department is only there to prevent lawsuits. The Store manager uses 3rd and 4th rate managing skills, she is not ready to be a manager let alone a store manager!"
bad,It could of been more successful if creativity would have been applied. NO work/life balance.  Unprofessional sales associates.
bad,"A typical day is 9 hours with a 1 hour break.  Scheduled hours are rotated among all associates in the Department throughout the week and are as follows; 9 am to 6 pm, 10 am to 7 pm, and 11 am to 8 pm.  Management is professional and supportive but is primarily focused on back of house operations for the Department and can provide very little front line support which is often needed due to high absenteeism.  The work environment does not lend itself for growth opportunities.  Co-workers are professional but highly competitive due to salaries being a straight commission base."
bad,I didn't particularly enjoy this job because I could not see myself making a career out of working in a call center. However this company uncovered a lot of my potential and helped me realize my worth.
bad,"I worked in the Irving Distribution Center for many years. The Loss prevention management promotes males versus females. I worked MANY holidays when others wanted to be with families. I worked when others wanted vacation. I worked the snow and ice days when others could not make it to the distribution center; including management. I listened to the ongoing trash/vulgar mouths of the management. Management changed the work schedule to meet their needs or else to ""set up"" an employee to be fired. HR does very little to support employees d/t lack of HR experience and skills. After the many years of employment, my rate of pay was barely above that of a new hire. Annual pay increases are little to nothing. I was a true assett; experience, knowledge of P&P, knowledge of culture -- yet being paid the same amount as a new hire with no experience. NM Irving Distribution runs ads for LP Associates all the time b/c they do not stick d/t management. It is sad b/c it can be a fun place to work. Hopefully someday management will be removed. An 8 hour audio/video of management in the workplace........"
bad,"Doesn't give good raises if hourly and benefits are very expensive. Also employee are very territorial, when it comes to the area they work. Salesperson are o commission."
bad,"Management doesnâ€™t care about you. HR doesnâ€™t care about you. Masks on for Halloween and after that itâ€™s scary. Employees are there to make an honest living and are very humble people. They will work you to the bone if need be. They donâ€™t care if they are under staffed. The OPM is always on a budget and will make you pay for it. The GSM is nice. Also, the only perks are the discounts and sweet people you will meet. Thatâ€™s it!"
bad,"Poor Management and Work life balance. Benefits are horrible. No internal growth opportunities. The overall culture of the company is bad. Constantly, in reactive mode."
bad,I went to Neimans because they told me they try to always promote from within. That is not the case and itâ€™s mt biggest issue. They prefer to bring in outside people vs looking at excellent internal talent.
bad,One particular department in Accounting has absolutely no work life balance.You are always putting out a fire. Training is mediocre. Management is disrespectful. The culture is horrible. The most part enjoyable is the discount.
bad,there is no room for growth with the company they almost always hire from outside so internal growth is impossible. so if you plan on trying to grow with the company its better to gain your experience through other companies before coming here.
bad,"Never step into a sales position at Neiman Marcus. The sales associates at Neiman Marcus are not treated well, they are underpaid, and the company demands all of their time. The company will promise a ton of money through commission, quick advancement through the company if desired, as well as a positive work environment. Every single one of these things is not a simple exaggeration - they are straight up lies. From what I hear management and corporate employees are compensated well. Management can be treated well depending on the store manager but thats not always the case. Corporate employees are paid nicely and treated well."
bad,"Favoritism at an all time high, very poor mgmt. Extremely poor team players. I want to work and give 110% where its appreciated. This company was not. Thank God I didnt last long there, my fingers started getting crooked due to Rheumatoid Arthritis setting in full bloom. I would still go to work in pain and hustling hard. That company did not care. Even though at the interview they tell you differently, as do other companies. SAD. No wonder their turn over is extremely high. Its not rocket science. Too bad those managers did not have a brain."
bad,"I come in and I immediately stand outside as the door greeter in a suit for 7 hours a day, or I would be at cashier handling sales."
bad,"Its boring, don't pay well ,cuts hours badly when not in peak season. Bad communication with mangers favoritism. I did learn people skill and how to drive equipment. off on weekends."
bad,A typical day at work consist of meeting interesting clients while improving my negotiation skills. The hardest part of the job it has to be with the management style of handling disagreements between employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the opportunity of meeting interesting clients and providing excellent service with the best products in the industry.
bad,Work was up and down depending on the work flow. 50 hrs one week and 20 the next.
bad,"Favoritism seems to run rampant in the White Plains location.  Allegations were made against an employee by another, yet no one was investigated.  It wasnâ€™t a good experience for me."
bad,"Neiman Marcus is not a great work environment. I did enjoy some of my coworkers and made a very good friend, the job as customer service associate is not recognized or compensated for the amount of work done. The management seems to pile everything thing on one department without any knowledge of all the department does for the company."
bad,"It was a super high pace of work, Like most places they Micro manage people. You had to watch your back or you would get all the difficult work. The hardest part is when you get fast enough to make your production they would up it more."
bad,"This company is not a team player. They work their best employees to the grown and praises the employees who don't help with customers etc. The manager has and will continue to violate the companies policies, because they allow it."
bad,Not a good environment. Favoritisms. Does not promote fairly. Toxic. No career planning if you wanted to go into management. Employees are rude to one another. Tooooo much drama!
bad,At Neiman Marcus youâ€™re expected to dress like a socialite and celebrity or look like you just got done with a photo shoot while being paid like a popper . They do discounts for employees to get 50% almost monthly.. however with what you get paid youâ€™re lucky if you can afford an apartment in the hood . The only way to make good money there is to be there a long time and build a client base . The pay structure and culture are awful.
bad,"No career advancement, been with the company for 10 years and I am stuck in the same department and position despite of producing over a million a year. Ive been applying for 7 years and they deny my application for another position or department  , they rather hire from another company than the people with in ."
bad,"Fun customers, built great relationships with the customers.  Unique product.  Always great to see a new customer become one of your best and loyal customers who you can assist with throughout the store."
bad,As an order filler at the Neiman Marcus Warehouse facility the work is fairly easy once you have been trained. It takes 3 weeks to officially be hired. As stated on our initial schedule we are to work Monday-Friday only to be told once we are hired on that a certain number of Saturdays have been added because of the holidays and when we were getting close to those certain number of Saturdays being done more were added until after the holidays. I wouldn't be surprised if the ups continued to add more Saturday's to the work schedule. There is no work life balance at all and I will not be working here much longer.
bad,Employees aren't taken care of. Many times short on staff and can be overwhelming. At times people are micro managed. Can be quite annoying and help isn't received.
bad,This job is very stressfull. If you want to go the bathroom at all you have to take it out of your break time no matter what. You deal with very uptight customers and when you have to call a store about a product their customer service skills are a zero.
bad,"I should of listened to the reviews before I started this job 8 months ago. It has been the worst retail management job I have ever had in 15 years. This company allows behaviors I have never seen in my life. If you have a problem like harassment and elevate it to corporate, nothing will get done and they turn everything around on you. I was a victim of this and sadly the company handled it so poorly I had to retain a lawyer. Do not drink the juice, this place is a cult."
bad,location has a great opportunity to grow but management and staff is holding it back. hopefully it will get better before a lot of the good workers find a new job.
bad,"As a product specialist have to preform facials, Oxygen machine for skin,  standing for 7 hours, not a lot of help from management,"
bad,"very unorganized , very unprofessional management and staff . Too much favoritism, no consistency in rules . I did not like the way the Returns Department was managed. HR department NO better, offered no solution to any issues  or concerns I had and nothing was truly confidential."
bad,The company does not care about their associates. Everyone is in a race for themselves and effective collaboration is halted by stale senior management not willing to change with the times.
bad,environment was very unstable. the job was easy but doing the same constant things everyday all day became very boring
bad,"Neiman Marcus is the epitome of luxury shopping.  The work environment is fun and enjoyable with different events such as fashion shows and personal appearances by designers and celebrities.  Sales employees are incentivized with various prizes for meeting sales plans or different performance metrics and are met with perks such as employee discounts and different employee appreciation events. Although sales employees are abundantly recognized, the support team and managers can be overwhelmed with execution of different events while managing day to day responsibilities with no help from the executive team.  A little appreciation for the support team could go a long way to create team morale and improve overall culture."
bad,Don't expect to keep your job unless you're willing to go behind peoples' backs and try to get others in trouble regardless of whether or not that person did anything wrong. This is the most stressful retail environment I've ever encountered. Management is misguided and HR cannot do their job successfully as they wear too many hats to be efficient in any of their many jobs.
bad,I enjoyed working with customers and learned a lot of techniques that better all of my experience that would help me in the long run.
bad,The day starts with a store morning meeting with all associates.
bad,"you never know what someone is cooking and it's hard to trust your extended family. a lot people with seniority so they're set in their ways.  few of the managers are very self absorbed, literally would not greet you, acknowledge you, and they all think you're incompetent if you have questions, concerns. in meetings, they would often encourage you to speak up and if you bring up an issue. you're suddenly nothing, but a nuisance to them and you're permanently shunned by every manager. a lot of them just listen to respond and they don't officially address any issues once they are brought up. all the managers are in a clique and high on their horses. it is very disheartening to learn when someone makes far more than you do when you put in an effort every day. a lot of lazy, pretentious old people."
bad,The on-boarding process at Neiman Marcus was amazing. The long tenure of most corporate employees speaks to the quality of the organization - quite impressive. The only negative part is dealing with people with limited social skills or respect of people in general.
bad,Managers do not care to develop talent as sales associates are paid full commission - sales associates who figure out how to make money on their own stay and the ones who can't figure it out on their own leave.
bad,"The discount is the best perk depending on the department you work in , you may have  lucrative pay. most clothing departments are not that great and very competitive like every other sales environment."
bad,Locate product to a line and make pricing tickets for them.. then push out to the processing area. Clean and help out where needed. I like to treat people the way I want to be treated.
bad,"A typical day is anwering phones and watching security cameras"
bad,I just did not like because I feel in retail you do not learn anything. It was not natural over there.  The people I worked with were stressing me over nothing.
bad,"Very aggressive and challenging work environment, most people don't last because of goals and no help from management. The only nice thing about working for NM is the customers. If you have a problem handling stress don't work for Neimans."
bad,Stay away from this company. You are a partimer but in the bussy season they want you to work 50+hours mandatory. If you are pretty and you like to kiss management behind you have an opportunity of advancement other wise forget it. There is so much favoritism for a few people and really bad treatment for other. Believe me when I tell you to stay away from this place.
bad,I worked for the fur services when I was younger. I inspected fur coats and was a shipping clerk. Fast paced place
bad,"Itâ€™s astonishing to me that a company built to define luxury and quality could treat its employees like ants. There is no culture of fairness or respect. Managers will defend poor behavior of top selling sales associates. Yet thereâ€™s no protection for high performers among jealous co-workers. The corporate office in Dallas is overwhelmed and inefficient. Custom orders are rarely, if ever, delivered on time. Their sales system hasnâ€™t been updated in 20 years. They do not treat their management or sales staff well. Human resources is a political joke. I will never ever consider working for this company again. I cannot patch for other locations. However, the Austin store was the worst job I have ever held in my career."
bad,I was able to perfect my Adobe Photoshop skills to the highest level. There were some very talented coworkers there who shared there emence knowledge of photshop with me. I forever grateful for that.
bad,"I worked with some amazing career sales professionals. However, many managers are not-so-stellar causing top producers to leave out of frustration. Plus, given NM's exponentially-growing, on-line business and the new CEO's mission statement, sales associates will soon become ""ringers"" and brick & mortar locations will soon become glorified showrooms for experiential customer engagement. Sound good to you?"
bad,If your a product specialist you have very high ringing goals and have to compete with sales associates which causes a lot of conflict. You will work all holidays and hours are not easy.
bad,Neiman marcus was a good company to work for. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work part time on a job and still work on you full time job.
bad,"Work here for the benefits or the discounts.  As a commission sales associate be prepared to give back 40% of your earned commission in returns.  Neiman Marcus customers are accustomed to purchasing, wearing and then returning clothing because their is such a lax return policy.  Managers tend to stick around because they have job security.  Very few if any, possess any real motivational skills, and advanced managerial training in leading teams is virtually non-existent.  The HR function is reduced to iPhone management.  Be prepared to be underwhelmed by the training that you will receive.  It is computer based, and mechanical.  And don't assume anyone in HR has any real mediation skills either, because they don't!  In an environment where anything goes on the sales floor, and ""work-it-out"" amongst yourself, is the catch phrase of the day, be prepared to be bullied by sales associates that have been around a while.  You will not be supported by HR because HR doesn't have a clue about creating an honest culture."
bad,Cannot keep employees due to micromanaging and shortening lunch breaks and still punishing employees when they need a little more time for restroom breaks. Not to mention no employee loyalty from company. Forcing new employees to learn things they are not ready for due to not being able to keep themselves staffed.
bad,I learned a lot about safety and OSHA compliance.  A typical work day was very long and dealing with many personalities.  Management was not very supportive of training methods in the growth and development of the staff.  The workplace culture was very hostile and the hardest part of the job was dealing with dishonest associates.  The most enjoyable part of the job was training associate to be safe in a dangerous environment.
bad,i didn't enjoy working at neiman marcus. they did not have a very good work and life balance. i always had to work weekends and i never felt like my concerns were heard.
bad,discount is great. im assuming the store I worked at was ran differently than most stores . Overall I met some great peoples along the way
bad,"A typical day at work consists of checking your email, seeing which clients you need to contact via email, phone call or hand written letter. There is a lot of down time and so you constantly have to find things to do to keep you busy. I don't think having issued iphones for each sales associate is really essential. I think updating the register system so it does what the iphones do would be so much more efficient and effective. My co-workers are fun and pleasant. The hardest part of the job is the health benefits, they aren't that great unless you are covered by your spouse and they have amazing health insurance. They are expensive and you still have to pay an out of pocket deductible. Despite that, the discount is absolutely awesome!"
bad,"Goody pay, but work around business needs only, Cannot go to school when working with them, not a job for students in customer care."
bad,I enjoyed packing  with other employees and answering questions that trainees had. I would pack for a couple hours and then when the volume was high i would move to a different department to clear out work and make jams and the lines was clear. To keep the production going and for employees to keep there production numbers.
bad,"I was able to be a self starter and work on my own projects while also managing two attorneys.  I was given many advanced tasks over the years, which enabled me to stretch in my knowledge and job skills.  The amount of work I was given for my own projects started to outweigh the work I did for my attorneys, which was a challenge.  I worked with wonderful people at my level."
bad,"Management favoritism is above all else. Immediate suspension upon an accusation made by another coworker. Hours vary drastically from 2 hrs to 9. When it' slow, it's so slow that bills are hard to pay. When it's fast(peak season) you are expected to work 12+ hours daily(even if you have other responsibilities.Been working there for almost two years. Learned how to order fill and pack."
bad,If your into working your way up and being a buyer then this would be great but you would need to move to TEXAS! Other than that easy way to make money but you have to put in a lot of hours to and try to busy on days that are slow!
bad,Good as any retail place is. The mall hours made it difficult to have a set schedule. 
bad,Nice enviroment but need better pay for everything you may put up with.
bad,"I'm very grateful to Neiman Marcus because I learned that working in luxury retail may be what I really want to for the rest of my life (management though, and not sales). However, I feel that there is no room for advancement. That said, if you want to have a better pay and position, it's going to be difficult unless someone retires."
bad,the amazing part to work with them is to be updated with the latest and greatest in fashion.
bad,"As a Multichannel Sales Associate, our primary job was to handle all things related to orders via phone, chat, and email. The difficulty with doing that was that we were to do all three at the same time while maintaining quality customer service through each method of contact. It was a great way for me to perfect my multitasking skills."
bad,"the people where nice very friendly I miss working there. I had to wrap items like shoes, make up, samples The stuff would be on a rack and I would have to check the reciept to make sure the numbers matched then wrap the items with the reciept on the outside."
bad,"Pay is commission vs draw 60% of what you sell is returned. Customers are not loyal. Store manager at Roosevelt Field is grumpy, not approachable, shows favoritism and only supports her million dollar sales club associates."
bad,"NM needs to find its footing, communicate its mission top down and consistently stay on mission."
bad,No room for advancement.   The company has it's policies and number sales goals you have to meet.  But the return policy is so bad.  People but the clothing and wear it and then think it's ok to return it. The company almost 95% of the time` would return the item after wearing it.   Definitely not good for business.
bad,Neiman's IT/IS department was completed outsourced to two companies from India.   Approximately 250 IT/IS professionals were walked out the door over a period of several years.  The company is in serious financial trouble and is heavily burdened with a lot of debt.  I would be very careful with this company.
bad,My opinion of the company is neutral there is lot of isssed with them laying parole off cutting jobs the mgt was very aggressive towards employee . The store mgr was always all over the place never really there for employees
bad,Co-workers are nice and friendly. But management is poor. They only care about themselves. HR doesnâ€™t care when you go to them. This company was a good place to work at. Until lately
bad,"I've had good times and bad times, just like anywhere.  But the quality of employees has been declining.  Some of the managers only care about their numbers and it is very hard to make your monthly numbers (sales).  Lots of returns.  Its awful"
bad,Retail is tough right now and their management style is even tougher.  It is the creme of the crop with experienced sales people and there are a lot of great lessons from a very diverse group of coworkers.
bad,"If you get an interview, be sure to ask what happens after peak season is over as far as hrs are concerned.  You don't get any vacation days for 6 months so be prepared to get sent home at 9-10 a.m. sometimes & your check is small."
bad,When I first applied at this company. I apply for full-time. Unfortunately  there were just giving 25 hours the most. I wasn't satisfied with the hours I was receiving otherwise it's great company. It was climate control. The pay rate was fair.
bad,The worst company I've ever worked for by far. HR is pretty much non-existent.. they treat their long-term employees horrible. FW culinary is a shame.
bad,Very structured environment in a call center.  Days and hours changed weekly.  The work atmosphere was not for me being so structured. Pay was below what I had been accustomed to.
bad,"Recruit straight from college. Treat you like a freshman in college. Acts like fashion is brain surgery. Pay is poor and advancement is poor. Only perk is NM discount, but only useful if your parents pay for your rent/car."
bad,It was a slow business.  It is your job to get the clients in the store to shop.  You must be very proactive and try to achieve unrealistic goals.  Management isn't the best; very clique-y.
bad,A typical day at work is checking my email and my daily quota from the day before. Then I reach out to clients for either follow ups or inviting them to specific events the store may be having. I enjoy my coworkers but it does get competitive as we do work on commission. I dislike working weekends.
bad,the food is great and the customer service is okay but the owner is very non-complient
bad,"If you are a very aggressive seller, this is the place for you. Management is only concerned with the bottom line and only cares for what you can do for them and how much money you can make for them. This company, in the last call division, is not very sustainable regarding their staff and feels it is easily replaceable. Overall, they pay very well and provide nice benefits, but a work life balance is hard to achieve working here. It is a highly stressful place to work."
bad,"This job was only a seasonal job,and if you wanted to make some extra money ,or they will help you to become a part of there team,that what i like to have that opition to be hired or i can work just for the season."
bad,"I learned a lot about the business, however Neiman Marcus took a longer time to adapt to newest trends. The Beverly Hills customers has seen everything from Paris to Tokyo. They come in expecting something unique. Neiman Marcus does not deliver to that clientele."
bad,The job is very much under paid. Some management take their positions to the extreme. Management do not know how to talk to the workers. Lack of communication in many areas. Hard work recognition goes unnoticed.
bad,"neiman marcus offers an open-ended return policy-great for customers, horrible for sales associates. You could get paid for your commission on an item, and then a month later someone could return that item, and all of a sudden you're in the hole because you lost that commission."
bad,You have to be in the Neiman Marcus  circle  or click what ever you want to call it. The sales associates thrive  on only sales sales and sales.  Oh yeah  did i mention sales ha.  Im into Customer service
bad,"Management wasn't good they don't solve any  problem, when they teach to job they hurt so much people also, The workers are always complaining about each other.You can not trust any body.They dint.t fallow their promise.The hardest  part is that you do not feel so restful  this is a performance deficit."
bad,"I think Neiman Marcus's biggest problem is that they are very over staffed. There were days where I wouldn't make a single sale because clients were greeted and infiltrated before they even made it to my department. There are many things that sets Neiman's aside from other retail stores, but the biggest one I seemed to have difficulty dealing with was that there was a team for everything. Visual, marketing, custodial, loss prevention, etc. Sales associates had exactly one job to do, sell, and because of the over staffing there would be many days you're left standing around twiddling your thumbs. That may sound like a dream for some, to go to a job where you don't have to do anything, but most associates are paid on commission, so you're not making the living you were promised in orientation and interviews. There are only so many phone calls and emails you can send to clients and other peoples clients, if you run out of work, other associates will often go tattle to management, that you aren't doing anything, to make themselves look better. It's high school drama at it's absolute finest."
bad,the associates i worked with were nice once you were there for about a year but as for being a new hire they have little to no patience which makes it very hard to be trained for several jobs at once. most jobs i had to learn on my own
bad,"the envoriment was nice for employees,management was great.."
bad,Assisting associates on a regular basis and satisfying customer with appropriate resolutions to problems.
bad,Flexibility of working from home or in office. Pay is competitive. Need more consitency from management. Employee information channels need improvement.
bad,"I only write review if something bad happened. Like very very bad. Someone who worked there over 30 years, and have very close friendships with the assistant store manager, and no matter how much drama she made, the assistant store manager would always clean her mess. And she got a chair to seat at counter all day long. She bullied many many new employees. Itâ€™s keeping going still"
bad,"The management team and lack of organization was always terrible. Everything from poor time management to how they talk to their workers was poorly handled. Pay also started to lack with peak season you got 40 hours on average a week at 13 per hour, but once it slowed down you barely worked 30 hours a week if your lucky with no ability to pick up new hours. All that paired with the bad environment and overall lackluster system did not make it worth it."
bad,"Favoritism is the name of the game at Neiman Marcus. If you produce and know how to ""schmooze"" with management, you shouldn't have a problem working there. Neiman Marcus San Francisco is an international tourist destination and if you only have the English language at your disposal, you will have a challenging time staying on par with your multilingual counterparts. What Neiman Marcus doesn't tell you is their level of interest and attention with its online customer base. They give offers and perks not given in store to drive their flourishing online business while it kills their in-store business. They will also pull product directly from their brick and mortar stock to fulfill online orders so the customers that actually do come in to shop are disappointed with lack stock driving them to shop online or with other retailers. Despite the companies self-sabotage, they still expect you to produce numbers that haven't been seen since before the Great Recession. They don't give raises or bonuses no matter how great of a performer you are, ""Sell more, make more."" If you don't mind this type of environment, by all means..."
bad,"Typical day at work is very slow, I learned how to deal with credit fraud, management does not directly address issues, workplace culture is belittling, and I was not challenged in this position."
bad,bad company in declining retail market. old school management doesnt adapt or seem to have much connection to sales staff ie whats really going on in store and on floor. not much walkin traffic at all anymore. same old same buzz words and middle managers spewing company line.
bad,"This is a great company as far as benefits.  However, your skills will get you nowhere if you are trying to move up to management with the approval of other managers.  However, if your manager is not willing to ""endorse you"" and other members of management want you to work under them dependable, responsible, or not you will not be able to move on."
bad,"Friendly management . Hard working and care for the store."
bad,"There was always alot of work to do but, it was always given to first shift. Supervisors did move workers around to help out in other areas  which was good to learn new things. Supervisors did not have backup plans when equipment including conveyor belt malfunctions. Instead, workers were sent home early causing production rate to fall behind."
bad,"Coming from the finance industry I understand the importance of good management for consistent, strong gains on a long term basis for any corporation. I am not confident that with the management that exists at this location, continue success will not continue for too long."
bad,Very slow most days and difficult to make sales with payment restrictions on the customers. I think it might be a good company just not a good fit for me.
bad,I am the Corporate HR Manager for 13 Stores on the West Coast. I primarily do all of my business via phone and teleconference. I work in an office environment with 3 other associates. The hardest part of my job is consistently managing competing assignments and priorities. We have a lot of employee relations issues that have to be dealt with timly and professionally. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the store management and seeing them learn and grow within their positions.
bad,Typical day involves picking up finished garments that was altered for clients and either sending it to their homes or scheduling an appointment for them to pick it up.
bad,"Automatic termination if you donâ€™t reach goals...I.e. opening accounts, receive perfect 10 on customer survey or donâ€™t receive any at all   Must contact well over 100 customers per week to advise upcoming events or birthdays etc   Most all departments are commission only  and the return rate is astronomically high"
bad,Very low hourly pay with yearly raises that are less than .50! Very hard work.  Managers are mostly oppressive.  I enjoyed the co-workers. The discount was very nice.
bad,You could never achieve the goals do to the return policies of the store..  The customers where able to wear the gowns and outfits and return them with out any question. you could never reach your goal
bad,not a great place to work. Very fewer growth opportunities and fewer benefits. I was working here as a consultant and never join this place as a consultant.
bad,worked hard not compensated met a lot of good people from various backgrounds
bad,"Stressful and unorganized , some managers were rude. Unfairness between coworkers. I loved the job. People who been there for over a few years thought it was ok to mistreat others."
bad,Working here made me hate the retail industry because it was the high end customer base that felt entitled to everything and it made the sales associates feel like they needed to impress the wrong people.
bad,Like most any publicly owned retail store they are more focused on the dollar than anything.  Business was very seasonal and was directly affected by how the stock market was doing due to the clientele's lifestyle.
bad,"Everyone at Neimans is miserable, immature, and stressed. The attitudes are apparent in the every day interactions. Nobody is happy there and thus the attitudes feed off each other."
bad,Business needs of the company and customer are top priority. Seniority is not a major factor when it applies to moving into different roles of the company.
bad,"My typical day at work is to clock in and start with the RF scanner and signing a line. Saying good morning to the co-workers and changing the trash bags, I would then start my day off with apparel. The hardest part of the job to learn was how to use the RF scanner. The most enjoyable part of the job is after I learned how to use the RF scanner and meeting all of my new co-workers."
bad,I have been fortunate to have many opportunites within my 8 year tenure with this company.
bad,"Opening the store, disarming the alarm system. Finishing up any reports or paperwork that needed to be filed away. Conducting a short meeting with the sales associates about loss prevention. Opening the main doors for the customers to enter, testing sensor alarm system, turning on store music, monitor cctv while issuing keys, box cutters, stamps and scanners to associates, perform daily audits while continuing to monitor cctv's. brief coworker apon arrival to their shift. The management does not really help with the process. The hardest part of the job is adapting to the consistent changes to the companies policy and the stores policy. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the other associates there. They have good positive attitudes and help keep morale up."
bad,"I worked in the changing room area. Customers were allowed to bring as many pieces they want to try. I have to make sure the same exact pieces that go in, come out."
bad,"Use to be a exclusive shopping experience !"
bad,It was a great place to work and it still can be with better management behind them. When I started 6 years ago the management was wonderful and I enjoyed working for the company. Alot of people have left and it is no longer the same. It can be stressful and unorganized.
bad,I learned how to provide excellent customer service and to go the extra mile for the client. Management was generally supportive. The hardest part of the job was pleasing the customer but on the other hand the most enjoyable part of the job was a happy customer.
good,"Could be fun at times but there was no room for advancement without resistance. Too many individuals do not want you to do better than them, even if you are more qualified for a position. They say they will hire in-house first, but that is not always the case."
good,some weeks you get 40 hrs some you 20 - 30. they offer no raises and the packing supervisor sucks
good,"Training could be improved for what was expected once getting on the phones. It was too short; therefore, could no way cover what I needed to know once I started taking calls. However, my team manager was great with support, tips, encouragement."
good,"This company has some of the worst supervisors I have ever seen in one establishment. If you do apply for the warehouse in Longview, TX, do not apply to work in the Lockerstock departments. The coworkers are great, but the supervisors are awful. Neiman Marcus does not care about their non-management employees. The pay is below par, the working conditions in at least 2 of the departments are rather hazardous due to lack of intelligence in design. I would not recommend anyone to work there."
good,As i worked her i saw people come and go but the people that should of been leaving never left. Alot of leads dating workers people drinking and doing drugs on the job they say full time but you barely get 4 hours a day
good,"I had a difficult time at this company due to the fact that it was very difficult to gain any upward mobility. Management tends to be very fickle and judgmental, and they don't groom there staff to advance."
good,"Working in a small store. Very little growth or advancement in a career. Only way is to go the corporate route which would be a big relocation. Good thing weâ€™re the schedule. Slow location, seasonal island job. If your in college or retired would be a good fit for you."
good,"the store environment has gone downhill since they expanded its online platform. no one wants to shop in-store, I don't blame them either. with most departments commission-only its very cut-throat. people will do everything they can to get that money. people aren't happy, and it shows."
good,"Itâ€™s nice and all working there but the new manager is horrible & the customers can be rude. You get too overwhelmed not worth it.  As a cashier customer service gets all the hard work, and customer service girls get yelled at by customers, they have a lot of responsablities that the managers should be taking care of. You end up being by yourself up there & it can get overwhelming when you need register backup and no one wants to help. Very hostile environment"
good,"Typical work week is Mon-Fri  7am-3:30p with mandatory Saturdays 7am to 1pm.  Often the work week will also change and will be a 50hrs five day work week.  "
good,"nice company to work for"
good,"In October of 2015, they laid off 95% of their Visual Managers. Now the leads have to do all of their tasks plus be responsible for the whole store environment. All in 37.5 hours a week, NO OVER TIME EVER. plus no increase of pay. There is no opportunity for growth or wealth. This company was purchased by a hedge fund and the Canadian Teachers retirement fund. They are making changes in a retail environment that they do not understand. They are dismantling everything that made us Neiman Marcus."
good,"Assist counter manager with training, sales reports, inventory, marketing, training, event planning, and execution. Most important to meet all sales goals. Currently, help to manage a team of 4 make-up artist and 2 sales support employees. The hardest part of the job is cold calling clients to invite for our monthly events and  successful  meet our booking quota. The most enjoyable is helping and solving our clients needs and building long lasting relationships for our brand. What I learned and will take with me from this experience is to work with different personalities;I've had the most interesting experiences in the last two year."
good,"Amazing place to work with great merchandise."
good,the store is very high-end so the fight for a customer is daily. because no one shops in store anymore. the sales floor is very selective so you must have a tidy area or will be wrote up.
good,I enjoyed my 7 yrs working with the customers. Internal management and ethics were horrible for such a great company.  I was threaten via strangulation by a manager once. The office politics were cut throat!
good,Great place to learn and grow. I wasn't a huge fan of working on commission. I worked with lots of great people and learned a lot about retail in my time spent Neiman's.
good,It's more about promoting who is favorite than who is qualified. Many times people with High School diplomas are promoted over those with Bachelor degrees. Most people that have an education leave.
good,"Having been there almost 3 years, the company was a great company to try out the work from home system. It's convenient for those still in college or with children. The benefits includes tuition reimbursement, adoption assistance, medical/healthcare, and employee emergency assistance. The culture is was lacking and morale was low. The only employees that were energetic and upbeat were those who had been there 25+ years. Otherwise, the energy is similar to that of the patients in a nursing home."
good,Work life balance was nonexistent due to it being retail but it was a fun job with amazing people.  Management was definitely not up to par and turn over was excessive.
good,Displayed perception of advancement and success is falsely portrayed by management. Management lacks support in personal and career development. Little openness to change or acceptance of new business growth proposals.
good,"Everything in the store is micro managed and the store environment is very oppressive. Most employees are unhappy in their roles and it is very hard to move up in the company, despite what they tell you upon hiring."
good,"Good place to work if you have a built up client base, If you're working in the cosmetics department keep to your self and just focus on your counter.. This store is extreemly slow and the deparment its self barely breaks 1million a year."
good,The company is a corporate atmosphere which unfortunately lacks feeling and compassion.
good,"You come in go over your assigned floor plan each and everyday then service customers. I learned how to engage customers and get them to buy products as well as the visual setups. "
good,"It was a ok place to work. For the job I was doing they didn't pay enough, the hours weren't that great and the management sucked."
good,Poor upper management constricts Reps from providing extended customer service to call-in customers. At the end of the day Mgt is only concerned about numbers and not the customer.
good,"Neiman Marcus would be an ideal place to work if they had better management. I would recommend this job to someone who is needing employment on the spot, but not as a career goal."
good,Good place to work for sales driven individuals. Neimanâ€™s really got off track and many people lost their jobs because of poor planning and execution.
good,"Not a relaxed place. you are expected to attack customers as soon as they entered the store. people gets annoyed at times,.  There is pressure to make your goal which creates a hostile environment,co workers are stealing your sales and constant fights on the floor. The store is very slow, cannot make money."
good,"Unfortunately managers do not look for the best interest of their team. Sales associates all rate Neimans so highly because of their compensation, this is not the case for every other hourly employee. "
good,"I did like working there. it was just the pay wasn't that good, but other than that it's good."
good,Morale has decreased since work continues to grow without superstars being compensated for great work.  No flexibility.
good,"Systems are antiquated, and advancement is tough. The people were very unhappy to be at work everyday due to management having strong tempers and emotional reactions."
good,"A typical day at Neiman Marcus consisted of working for 2 hours then having a 15 minute break. It was a warehouse job so I've learned to organize clothing by color, size, and department. The hardest part about this job is hitting your PEP Score for the day in whatever department you're in. The most enjoyable part were meeting new people and being in a different enviornment other than fast food."
good,"I was very exited about the job but Management is not the best. Full time is 37.5 hours, thats it. They won't allow overtime. The hours are flexible so no set schedules & and of course you can request days off but if management wants them too, they will take them over you. Benefits are crazy expensive too so expect a low low check."
good,"As in most jobs, you miss your coworkers the most.  Although, I must admit, Iâ€™ve never before been spoken to during monthly performance meetings so shabbily by my manager as here, the cream of the retail crop.  It mustâ€™ve sounded more constructive in translation.  Anyway, I interacted with a ton of great customers, the most knowledgeable coworkers imaginable, and loved the time I had there.  Everyday, vendors from different departments throughout the store would come in to give morning tutorials about their latest offerings/seasons merchandise.  Apart from Holidays, it could be, as a coworker so aptly put it, like being a museum guide."
good,The managers are unfair and the pay is very low. The benefits are good only if you spend a lot to buy things with your discount.  Some employees are treated with favoritism
good,"Typical day: Customer service, stock merchandise, assist fitting rooms and backup cashier. Everyone who works there is usually friendly. Not a bad place to work."
good,"A good company that could be great if they:"
good,I wouldn't recommend this job for those who do not enjoy selling or are not good at selling.  Advancement in position and pay is dependent on the amount of sales make and accounts you open.
good,Fun place to work but the management has to change in order to make workers happy and also the warning system for workers needs to be revised and improved.
good,"a company over a century old trying to compete with the new ""see now buy now"" consumer mindset. Some people have worked there for 35 years- famtastic longevity, however those people just cant comprehend the sort of instant consumer mindset these days. they struggle to understand the fact that we cant wait six months for a catalog to be shot, printed and mailed out.The executives have this desire and mindset, the newest hires just coming out of college have this mindset, it is more of the middle managers that give the most push back."
good,"The Neiman Marcus in Westchester, NY is extremely slow paced. The day would go by slow and the number of employees outweighed the clients shopping. This would make a hostile environment when you are working on a small base pay with commission."
good,Management wants to be way too involved in what goes on in Associates lives . The environment is Super stressful and Doesn't really provide solid solutions for help . Trying to sale comfortably can feel like a rat race and management encourages being aggresive to say the least .
good,"There are very few advancement opportunities and there is a large gap of pay between their sales employees and other employees.  If one of the top sellers of the store violates a company policy or is caught stealing, Neiman Marcus doesn't fire them but instead gives them a warning.  If you aren't a top seller and you are caught doing the previously mentioned things, you are fired.  I don't understand why they have these policies that I am paid to enforce if they don't enforce them and just look the other way.  Loss prevention is basically there to smile and greet all of the employees as they walk through to start their day and nothing more."
good,I enjoyed working from home with Neiman Marcus unfortunately this was only a seasonal position so that's why i no longer work there but it's a pretty convenient job
good,"Aside from the chaotic structure and lack of training, Neiman Marcus derives it's standard from an old, draconian/authoritarian type of work environment, where they heavily play favorites and there are no ifs, ands, or buts when it comes to certain policies."
good,The management is good and the people are mostly enjoyable to work with. There is little opportunity for advancement and not a lot of rewards/recognition in sales.
good,"All IT work being outsourced to TCS and Infosys (India).  No regard for long-term employee experience. Company is bleeding money, been bought out twice via leveraged buyout, in debt to the hilt.  They are trying to outsource everything to cut costs."
good,Company restructered its internal runnings as it pertains to their sku systems which  made doing business very tedious and laborious.
good,The atmosphere is very relaxing and enjoyable. The people and incentives keep you coming back day after day. Management makes job work life balance very hard.
good,"Department managers DO NOT work together or coordinate. Within departments, managers and supervisors give opposite instructions. New information about processes is rarely announced or explained. It is a stressful work environment. Nobody there is on the same page!"
good,Its a great place if you are in the sales not in the support area. Not much room for advancement. Management has been improving but still a few flaws.
good,I enjoy having the flexibility to work on jobs alone and still have the backing and support on some projects as a member of a team.  Moral has recently taken a dip due to many layoffs and restructuring of the company.  There have been many notable cuts to most departments at the store level.
good,"In my role as Visual Merchandise Coordinator, I managed 14 departments in a store over 100,000 sq ft. I oversaw the visual standards for Neiman Marcus, while maintaining the brand integrity of various luxury vendors, fashion houses, and companies we work with in our location. "
good,Company is overall a good company to work for. They need to have more incentives for the employee and also more team builders.
good,Supportive of hourly associate but not of middle management. HR was an obstacle in disciplining staff to make the work environment better.
good,"okay place to work, flexible hours, room for advancement.  "
good,The job was very fun and cool in the beginning but they tell you its a promote from within but they lie. And they also give the cheapest most pathetic raises and expect to make you happy.
good,The location I work at was pretty ok. Some of the coworkers there were friendly. Management showed a lot of favoritism towards employees and customers they liked or customers that spend the most money. It was too much gossiping there. Great discount and I got to meet people from all over the world. I had to get people to open credit accounts and get their emails. The managers sometimes talk to the employees any kind of way.
good,"LP Leadership is full of some amazing individuals. Great people to work for, however, advancement is incredibly difficult. Must be open to and except change."
good,Life/work balance was not desirable. Management needs to focus on retention. I would not return to this position for lack of stability and the current hierarchy
good,"Retail sales opportunities are shrinking every year. Pay is becoming an issue. Lack of stock is an issue. Too many people working at a department is an issue when there are no sales."
good,"Menial work is needed.  As part of the OST the store acted as a warehouse for online sales.  Job is to find product, collect it, pack it and send off to customer."
good,I strongly disagreed with the way sales associates were paid.  They had no return policy so clients often return items and the sales associate had to pay back their commission if the return was within a year. Items were often worn and damaged.
good,"The applications would run super slow of course negatively impacting customer service delivery. Otherwise, kind colleagues cool people to work with huge communication gap between management and in store associate vs online associate. Hardest thing to deal with is the pay not much incentive not a lot of opportunities to make commission due to limited inventory which count towards such little rewards. The customers are the beat of this retailer and keep everyone amused and fashionably current."
good,"The Neiman Marcus culture and experience is one of a kind. However, the management styles vary by store and the company lacks CONSISTENCY across the board. "
good,"It was an amazing place to work.very fast paced .Learned allot there."
good,"could be very tense , everyone trying to get customers to make and close a sale. Very aggressive and sometimes unfriendly. you have to be constantly making sure someone else do not take your customer. its  a hustle enviroment"
good,"My overall experience at Neiman Marcus was a learning curve. I was brought on as a supervisor, however felt I did not get the from my manager and mostly my store manager. I was regularly undermined when working with my team and did not see growth potential in the company. I did enjoy the customers and my peers the most. I learned a lot about myself as a manager and how to grow as a person."
good,I gain a lot of knowledge on all levels of the retail world which gave me the tools needed to grow within the company although there is not much room for growth i pushed my self to gain as much growth as i could
good,"Neiman marcus is a fairly good place to work considering that it is now a public owned business."
good,"Worked here five years, management is poorly communicated. benefits expensive to employee. Salary poor as well. Hard to move up. company on shaky grounds."
good,"Not enough walk in traffic from tourists, and repeat clients don't appreciate getting phone calls about new merch/promotions. The dress code is laid back as is the management of my particular location. I feel that there should be more incentive and a higher commission along with more praise for good sales, it would motivate much more than just sales alone."
good,"Supportive management. Fun working alongside colleagues and developing relationships with customers. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting."
good,"can work as many hours if you know the job"
good,All they cared about was the numbers. 20 cent raise once a year. Expensive health care. Played favorites at my location. Fun environment other than the favorites. Hardest part of the job was dealing with all the random drama that occured.
good,"Retail is a tough industry to work in when it comes to work/life balance and schedule. However Neiman Marcus is one of the better companies to work for. The benefits and discount are fair."
good,Awesome place to work at. Company culture and systems are very antiquated. Colleagues are fun and all get along great. Opportunities are hard to come by.
good,"Neiman Marcus is a great company to work for however the management team seems to lack a sense of urgency to develop their employees to their fullest.  Work/ life balance is average, would expect a much niche community within the company however it feels as if your on your own."
good,I had a great time working for Niemans. Coworkers are amazing however it is a 100% commission based job so it can be very cut throat.
good,"Managed daily account activities by operating the store credit "
good,"Luxury Merchandise and great staff. Clients are more than lovely. "
good,We're a tight knit group and we help each other out a lot but management is horrible. 
good,"Fun, social environment, Get along well with my coworkers and create a positive work environment on the sales floor."
good,Long 8 hour day on your feet the whole time. Often times not that busy and have to be very aggresive in order to sell. Management doesn't seem to care about their employees and only care about the bottom line. However all co-workers are very nice and enjoyable to work with. Have definitely learned about styling and merchandising and have new love for designer clothes.
good,Nice place to work with flexible hours and now you can work from home one day a week.  Dress code is casual which is great and location is irving texas which is close to a lot of nice places to go for lunch.
good,"My fellow coworkers were welcoming (for the most part). Management wasnâ€™t great, issues were never really handled, more so just pushed to the side. I didnâ€™t feel valued."
good,"Honestly the stress is not worth $12/hr. As a customer care agent you are constantly reminded of what not to do to get fired and you are a worker bee. The customer's can be very unpleasant. Policy and procedure changes every 90 days so mastering the job is not possible. The employee discount is a plus to all the headaches. However, is peace of mind worth a discount? Do not expect advancement unless you plan to be the perfect employee, which to NM standards, is impossible."
good,No real leadership at this particular location. Unfair wage practice. Pay is not on par with the cost of living in the area. Upper manage definitely play favorites and it's noticeable.
good,Very difficult work environment.  Numerous people have issues with upper management.  Hardest part of the job was others taking advantage for work they didn't do.
good,"I began as an associate in the active department, which was great, because I worked hourly+commission. However I was not prepared by the lack of customers in the store.  I was given goals that were unattainableto make and resulted in a deflated mind set. However, I kept going and to this day I'm still working at Neiman Marcus.  I am not a quitter."
good,"Boring, slow. For the lazy workers they earned their pay, but for all they ask of you, if you actually do your work, you deserve more, ungrateful for the extra work you do and only focused on your shortcomings. I got it cause I was told it was an easy job. Iâ€™ve gained good experience cause of all the rolls I had to fill do to understaffing and high expectations"
good,its a retail store.  Most management and associates are good people to work with.  There are some managers who like to micromanage too much.  Loss prevention gets the short end of the stick as there are hardly any incentives for it.
good,"Retail is hard in any company, however the sales assoicates are  a great group to work with. Niemans is forever changes to meet the needs of the customer, however slow to help employees."
good,"Employees should not be allowed to cheat in order to meet their sales quotas."
good,"Room for advancement. Learned a lot and would not be where I am today without Neiman Marcus Group. This place is a great first step in your career, not somewhere you will want to stay forever. Vacation policy sucks."
good,"I think they can train more after just throwing new employees on the phones. There is no phone learning period, you will be evaluated immediately after your first call. You are graded on the things you never learned. then when you ask for help that counts against you too. EVERYTHING counts against you."
good,"Individual Contributors - "
good,"This is a fast pace upscale environment. You encounter a lot of different personalities. Staff is great! Managers are mixed, some are cool some are on power trips"
good,The data center is a business casual work place. It was a fairly friendly work place and fairly relaxed atmosphere. It has somewhat of a flexible work schedule.
good,Neiman Marcus is a leading retail provider who provides employees an opportunity to purchase high end merchandise at a discounted price. Neiman Marcus tries to provide a work life balance by closing earlier than other retailers.
good,This job would be so much better if the managers knew how to manage people instead of trying to keep a bonus. I am being shorted $ an hour because of a manager wants to keep their budget tight so that they can have a bigger bonus.  New flash you already getting at least $65-70k so why not spread the wealth to the hourly employees. Receiving Lead positions should be making at least $19/hr and receiving associates should be making at least $12/hr but like I said before managers are slow and greedy so they will not understand the logic of paying employees their worth. The 30% discount is cool especially when they allow you to double dip with other sales and discounts.
good,"As manager, always involved- always hands on with staff."
good,"The company has been great to work for going through college but in my time at Neiman Marcus Last Call, I saw many opening for coworkers to advance through the company but instead they stayed where they were and the company hired from without."
good,"There is a high rate of turnover in the night shift and employee dissatisfaction that creates a lack of morale.  However, I found the management staff more than willing to work with me."
good,"Extremely fast paced environment. If you like to be mobile and active with a drive to learn this is the place to be, temporarily. The company is going through a reconstruction period that seems to have been going on for years. Even though most cutbacks are recent you learn that many of the higher ups were aware for a long period of time and will act surprised when it happens. The structure of management is quite skewed and you will have so many bosses that you are not sure what the expectations are supposed to be. Hours are retail of course and you are always subject to different hours and a high turnover rate, however from what I have seen it is in large part due to the push out by the managers in this department. If you apply here I strongly recommend that you keep your resume polished and continue to look if employed."
good,"The job was all Adobe Photoshop for 8 hours. Mostly removing tattoos and other skin abnormalities. Every once in a while you'd be asked to color correct some product, or scale an some product down. I started out as a freelancer for 4 years and when I finally was hired on full time they laid me off 4 months latter."
good,"At times, the company lacks leadership, but it may be because the pay is not great and those that are qualified do not stay long."
good,"too much emphasis on technology, not enough on the fact that we work on commission and are self-motivated to sell. we need managers who have worked on commission and understand....."
good,"NMG has a clear division between employees and the contracting companies managing it's IT Services and Infrastructure."
good,"Processing merchandise and getting it ready for the sales floor."
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking 60-100 calls per day from customers, store management and sales associates. While working here I have learned many things about the retail credit industry and the intricacies of credit evaluation, credit risk and credit fraud. As for management I have no words. My co-workers are very professional and make coming to work enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is not being able to give immediate answers to certain inquiries because the job in many instances depends on other departments."
good,"I held a work from home position. There were numerous technical difficulties that were not resolved after numerous calls to the head IT department and numerous tickets put in to the system. I would get an email saying that it was fixed, but it was not, then I would not get anything for weeks. Very frustrating. There was also no real system to get time off for things that you did not plan for when you were hired as a work from home employee. There were no direct bosses for you to speak with, you could call in to a phone number and talk to someone one day and someone different the next day and still not get your issue resolved. The best part was going to work in your pajamas and being self-reliant. The worse part was of course mean people as customers."
good,"coworkers were great, pay was not "
good,"I learned quite a bit in receiving product and stocking, picking orders, and even packing product. "
good,Fast pace environment.  Management is flexible and understandable to a certain extent.
good,I work from home
good,"A typical day at work is creating a positive personal shopping experience for clients. I learned a variety of techniques to make clients feel at ease, confident and pleased with their wardrobe choices. My co-workers are absolutely amazing individuals and the atmosphere that they create is the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of my job is the inconsistent flow of customers which create very inconsistent paychecks."
good,Neiman Marcus Customer Service department was a good place to work if you enjoy interacting with other people. You are provided with help if and when you need it.
good,This was a low stress job for the most part. Calling clients about upcoming sales was the most stressful part. Benefits and coverage were good however pay was low
good,"This is a 24/7 work environment. Work from home is the reason I work here. Management is great however, they are outsourcing work a lot and there is always change. Metrics change monthly and you job may also. Pay is not so good for the work and people you deal with."
good,"Neimans was nice - I got lucky and had some really wonderful people in my department, and my managers were great. Commission vs. draw is a tough environment - you really have to hustle to make money when it's slow. Discount is great!"
good,"You will never know when you might have to work overtime. You will never know where they will cross-train you to do someone else's job. A lot of operations are redundant or straight up not the right thing you should be doing, so you end up having to do a lot of backtracking work. Other than the frustrations and the stress management puts on everyone the job is easy to do for the money they pay."
good,"I had growth opportunities and made some great friends along the way. There were a lot of theft/fraud at our location."
good,I have worked for Neiman Marcus twice during my career.  I loved my job and both experiences until they starting dissolving senior store team positions.
good,"I learned how to work with elite customers.  I learned just how important Gucci, Prada, and Chanel items are to them. "
good,"I learned so much at my position with NM and met so many amazing people, the discount is great and the connections are awesome! Outside of that the pay is pretty low and the culture is very specific and you can sometimes feel like you don't fit in, won't get that promotion because you don't fit the ideal ""look"" etc."
good,MAKE YOUR GOAL OR LEAVE!  All they care about is if you made your sales goal and opening accounts. Management is on you 24/7 about selling and following up on your contacts.  Managers literally want you to harass your customers with the NM cell phones they give you.
good,I believe that Neimanâ€™s is a good stepping stone and networking space. When it comes to advancement in the company it will be a long time before you see any change.
good,The company was overall not a bad company to work for at all. The upper management donâ€™t seem to understand what is going on at stores or warehouse levels.
good,For my 1st experience with retail it was an awakening experience. They didn't allow me a enough time for training. I  was basically thrown into the job and taught myself a lot of things. I read most every day to be  Efficient at my job.I I was unaware of retail a had to do evening studying to teach myself.
good,"Typical day: start to look all ph.& email mess fr customers and fr. Company; answered that, make special orders, call vendors or Buying Office for diferent reasons; walk around my own dep. and around the store, before open;check everything is on place, terminals and merchandise at the dept.; recovery is need it; build my own business;attend vendors meetings, Company meetings; special vendor's breakfast or lunch for new products's presentations."
good,This company sadly has not been managed well the past few years which is showing in the fiscal numbers.  Money was allocated to many projects that had no ROI.
good,Working for Neiman Marcus give me a sense of pride security and a vision.  The opportunity to experience working for Neiman Marcus was a great opportunity and a dream come true
good,"typical day at work involves approching new and existing clients, generating sales and exceeding daily weekly and monthly targets, knowing the latest fashion brands, trends, keep up to date with different products in the store and various departments and delivering great customer service"
good,"The company encourages you to take time and give back to the community . You're encouraged to volunteer as an individual, with your immediate team, as well as your division."
good,"The designer clothes we get to work with and employee discounts/events are great. There can be some work drama and office politics but for the most part, the company promotes camaraderie. The downfalls are awful management, poor training system and no opportunity to advance within the company."
good,This is a typical retail environment.  Expected to meet sales goals and maintain a positive attitude. Great way to get into fashion/retail
good,I loved the environment and variety of people. I would help with sales of shoes. Help ganitoral when needed cleaning windows and glass containers that hold jewelry. I also would help with clothes hanging up and placing clothes out on the floor.
good,Fun place to work and great product to sell. Business is slow right now and management blames employees for not making sales but you cant sell if there are no customers....
good,"Did gift wrap during holiday season and customer service. I remember it being a very pleasant place to work, but it was a very stuffy cliental and entitled customers. Other then that I enjoyed it very much and learned how to do the Neiman Marcus special gift wrap"
good,"Your experience working for Neiman's can fall into a wide range, depending on the department you find yourself in. To their credit, they try to create a fun work environment but there a lack of communication from the top down along with seemingly random decision making creates a sense of mistrust within the company and a disconnect between the business and it's employees."
good,"it was cool and interesting to see how a corporate company is run. There are so many rules. awesome brands, but not the best styles to choose from"
good,"Management was really bad , always felt rushed and the manager was really bad at managing time, human resources are liars and so is the manager , compensation is decent , people who worked there were so loving and caring thats the only thing i loved about working there."
good,It is a good company to get your foot into the door for future opportunities. There are some quality managers and great employees in various departments. Work/life balance is fair depending on the department. Managers are willing to work and train you.Poor Compensation and raises.There is not much opportunity to grow in company.
good,Co workers are friendly and times passes by fast due to the different seasons involving retail.  The company does not keep up with the latest technology.
good,Politics rule.  Watch your back; there's a lot of buck passing & excuses.  Most management can't tell quality work over hype & flattery.
good,A typical work day would be showing up before opening cleaning and setting up the restaurant for service prepping staff for any specials and goals to be met for the day. I learned extensive customer service and to delegate work when needed. Co-workers where not as driven as I am but all in all work got completed. Hardest and best part of the job was being able to run the entire restaurant solo when the managers where in dispose.
good,Not for the sensitive of heart or somebody looking for a permanent position. Management can't be depended on and everything will fall to your shoulders whether it's part of the job or not. Good staff and pay but  not worth the politics.
good,To much work for not enough pay. would be a great company for work for if can have growth.
good,"I learned to be part of a great team to reach certain goals."
good,management is good.  benefits are not good. there is no work-life balance.
good,"I am a Multi/Channel associate. I handle customer request via online/email. I've learned that Customer Service is a direct reflection on how customers see the company as a whole. I would say the hardest part of my job would be not receiving ""that a girl"" or pat on the back for a job well done. All though I enjoy working from home I feel I have outgrown the company and would like to advance with the options of a salary increase a non lateral move."
good,A great place to gain experience and insight in a luxury environment.
good,nice people
good,"If management would have been more ""stable,"" it would have been a great place to work. Also it is very slow. You really have to make cold calls to make your sales."
good,"It all depends on your office. Everyone in my office hated their job. The company underpay's and it's sad how high the turnover rate is. It was a good foot in the door, but that's it."
good,Trato injusto y muchas preferencias terrible lugar
good,"A typical day at Neiman-Marcus was working in different departments, other than the ones that you were assigned.  You learned something new daily. Management was always missing in action.  The hardest part of the job was all of the changes, there was changes in procedures, working hours, or who would be fired next. The most enjoyable part of working at Neimans was the people that I work with"
good,So a typical day consists of constant outreach to clients. Making sure each client is provided the best service. Helped bring high profiled clients to the store.
good,The people that i worked with where so much fun to be with every day. They where all much older woman than me but they had good stories and candy! I never know where older people get those strawberry candies from but they're so good.
good,"I coordinated the shipping and receiving as well as stocking. I was also tasked with data entry, signing for packages, and light janitorial services for the company."
good,"Overall good job low pay , You do get to work from home "
good,"Great place for anyone who loves top notch, high fashion.. Top tier clientele gives you the opportunity to build substantial repeat business. Ultimately increasing your earning potential."
good,"Average place to work. Has its ups and downs. Fair pay. Fair hours. Mostly fair people to work with. There is no typical day in loss preventions, every day is different."
good,"great company to work for in terms of benefits and discount.the westchester location as little to nothing to sell.and if you go in as draw vs commission.forget it and run for your life.you will go in arrears and you never will be able to get out,just 1 big game and you will go home with just your salary and never see your commission again and end up owing the company.if you go in as salary plus commission then thats a little better."
good,"I did the same job for almost 9 years, it all is really repetitive but it was easy which is why I stayed for so long. I got to meet new people and my job felt important"
good,"Worked for a leader who believed in me, and rewarded people who worked hard, and delivered strong performance. Unfortunately, there is little room for career advancement unless you are willing to relocate.  Left the company because I was recruited by another company."
good,"It's retail, so it's got pretty good work-life balance, but don't expect to spend time with family on holidays. But that's what you sign up for working in retail. The new system seems to promote almost an extreme competition among sales associates. I don't necessarily like the lack of respect for those willing to intersell as many sales associates, especially those who have been around a long time, tend to get angry when you sell out of your department. Some management is good. HR department needs lots of work because nobody seems to have answers right away. Culture keeps changing, and there's always the lingering feeling the store can close at any moment. Retail is suffering so it's a bit hard to make personal numbers and goals."
good,"Great place to work. I had no issues with the management team or needing days off, the schedule just was too late and needed some better in regards to scheduling."
good,"Itâ€™s a decent place to work for. People are very nice and diverse, but is lacking organization, training, and opportunities to improve. I had a good time working there, but wish there was more in person training to understand and better serve people whenever a conflict happened."
good,Teaches and molds you to be the best in the fashion retail world. Upper management can be very intense at times but overall a great company if you love luxury fashion
good,we clock in they let us know how much work we have n tells us what location we will b in then we start working until the first break then go bk to work till the job is done
good,"Neimans can be a great place to work if you have the clientele. If you don't have the clientele, you will be stressed to make numbers to ensure that you even get a decent check every two weeks. "
good,"It was a good company very tiring but i maintained it for a while, the pay was outrageous i loved it for da moment i spent there........................."
good,There were some great people there. But the company was in a financial crisis when bought in different management team to clean out the people.  Typical practices of too many company.  Senior management mistakes at the expense of good working people.
good,"Working at Neiman Marcus was fun for the most part. No two days were the same, every day was different and that's what help[ed to make it great. I worked with some good people who was always helpful to one another,"
good,"I honestly think it was the best job I ever had, I am very sad I lost the job, wish i had the opportunity to work there again, I'd do anything to work there again."
good,"Neiman Marcus is a great company to work for! The people and managers are great and there is a lot to learn while working there. You aren't just a sales associate, you have the opportunity to work in all aspects of the company."
good,"Busy,stressful,long it had itsgoood and bad points as any other company Im sure. I learned to be patient and just enjoy the people around me everyday.Management was ok ,it was always somewhere to work , the hardest part was leaving my co-workers, most enjoyable was all the picnics, cook-outs we shared."
good,"Nice company to work for with a focus on associates work, life and balance. The CEO is dedicated to the company and shares the goals of the organization."
good,Hard working/Driven associates have potential to have lots of success based on the strength of client relationships. Associates success is also considers knowledge of products and sale techniques.
good,"Neiman Marcus is a commission based sales environment.  It can be very stressful to work for commissions. It is a back-stabbing work environment.  For the employee who isn't aggressive enough or lacks the up-sale skill set it is impossible. If the employee is in the bottom of sales for an area too many times within a set period, they will be fired.  This makes it incredibly stressful for all new hires to keep their jobs.  It also makes for a tough work environment."
good,"Not great management, from the top down. Loss prevention is a good gig straight out of college but nothing more. I can't speak for the retail side of it though"
good,"I started off with believing i did the right transition, after working here I have noticed how associates are not treated equally. I like the work life balance but if you are a co manager not salary you will not like it."
good,All the hype about Neiman's...it's not all that great to work or shop there.  Management is not at all helpful and salespeople are sharks!  Very toxic environment!
good,"Fun work place "
good,while employed here a regular work day was good but most days they wouldn't have enough work and would have to send people home and also it seems like they pick and people to get on too
good,"I worked at the outlet store in Orlando, FL  we changed management 4 times in 3 years and nobody is no longer allowed to get 40 hours. I love the discounts on top of discounts best part about working there. There is a lot of favoritism that goes on here."
good,"Learned great people skills and great product knowledge"
good,This place was ok to work however it was very understaffed.  They need to do a better job at making sure the store is well staffed & also that the entire sales team shares the workload equally.  I experienced senior associates who kept other associates busy stocking while they in the meantime racked up all the sales with customers.
good,"Count  money in register, stock, learn different things from through out the store, and making sure the counter is clean and stocked for the next day. Most fun about the job is meeting wonderful people from all over the place and making good friends."
good,"Typical day: opening/closing registers, assisting customers, using iphone to contact clients on a daily basis."
good,Unload the pallet and process merchandise. Make mark downs on merchandise if required. Pick and send out customer orders. Keep clean and safe inventory area.
good,A typical day at work consists of contacting all clientele with information about active services or ongoing store events and meeting with clients or walk ins to sell the latest in high end fashion.   I learned how to manage multiple client accounts and accommodate to meeting the expectations of our high end clients so they will be satisfied with their luxury shopping experience.  The management was there when you needed support and handled all our vendor meetings providing current fashion insights to allows us better selling information.  The coworkers were confident in their ability to sell and yet remained fairly helpful surprisingly in a strictly commission environment.  The hardest part of the job is trying to make daily sales goals when business is slow.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having first hand access to all the latest high end merchandise and experience working with celebrities and designers.
good,"Over all it is okay. "
good,"I enjoyed working for  Neiman Marcus but unfortunately you work a lot more hours than you are compensated for, especially during the Holidays."
good,Inbound call center environment. Plenty opportunity to advance and earn additional commission. Training was very good. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. Product samples for employees. Work from home positions available.
good,Provide excellent service to the customers and work as a team to reach store goals. Co- workers were great always friendly and willing to help when needed. The day would go by fast because it was a great environment to work in.
good,This is an okay company to work for if you are completely about the corporate lifestyle. Easy to move up to a certain point.
good,"I have no good things to say about working here, It's a job. The supervisors do not encourage you to move up and hold you back from promotions."
good,I really like the people I interacted with. my immediate supervisor was a great man. the rating system in which the view your work by putting numbers in a system is unrealistic. if you take pride in putting your name on something this may be a perfect challenge for you. I am a believer in quality over quantity. this was not the place for me. I learned a lot but felt like my time was wasted.
good,"As far a working in a retail store, I would say Neiman marcus is pretty good. They give their employees 1 weekend off a month and 2 sundays which is awesome. They also have a great discount. The CEO is nice."
good,It was great environment to work in this company and i have improved a lot.
good,"A typical day at work was very interesting because I was able to interact with customers. I learned how to deal with customers that weren't to happy with their products. Co-workers were interesting because your dealing with employees with different cultural backgrounds, something I love! The hardest part of the job was not having products that customers really wanted to purchase. Most enjoyable thing about the job is, again, interacting with customers!"
good,There was no review. I did a multitude of duties. Everything from filing and making phone calls to going to the store to pick up items to wrap Christmas presents. Every day was a little different.
good,40 hour work. Some extended hours. Corporate managers are friendly. Customers and co-workers can be challengin.
good,"Unloading, loading trailers. Management was ok a bit harsh at times."
good,Neimans is an awesome place to develop your skills and luxury experience.
good,Great place to work. Hours are okay. Co-workers are enjoyable. Managers are helpful.
good,"convenience work at home job, received inbound phone calls"
good,This location is filled with friendly workers. High demand environment.  Most days are slow with low customer traffic. Events are thrown often. Working alone happens most of the time. A lot of mis communication happens around event days. No over time given when needed. Very strict on hours and attendance. You are required to work one weekend per month.
good,"As a contractor, designed, coded, and tested an enhancement to the existing Replenishment System to automatically calculate Min/Max ranges of staple inventory and display results online for user review. Using specifications provided by the user, devised a method to extract inventory information from system VSAM files and IMS databases, populate a new Model Review VSAM file, and present Model Review Data online via CICS to be accepted or rejected by the user. Final system consisted of four new COBOL II batch programs, two new CICS programs and maps, and changes to existing maps and screens."
good,"wrapping gifts according to size and weight, customizing gift wraps and working on a high volume factory line"
good,"An Excellent enviroment for learning and growing personal clientele skills.  Provides the highest quality luxury merchandise.  Seeks"
good,"I'd rather not review this place. "
good,"Waiting to see how much work is available for the day."
good,"-Competitive and inconsistant"
good,pack items that were ordered for shipping. placed in boxes and sent up the line
good,Selling designer jewelry and cross selling throughout the store
good,"Started as security, then cashier, then customer service for gift wrapping. First job once moved to Dallas, Texas"
good,Performed financial systems administration for Hyperion and Oracle
good,It was a place were you could grow as a manager but required alot of demanding hours to meet your sales goals.
good,Assisting clients needs at retail counter or over the phone
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to help customer,and build long lasting, trust worthy relationships with them"
good,"Neiman Marcus is a high-end retail department store. I worked there for a little less than a year, and my experience was not very pleasant. I found most of my co-workers to be very stuffy, and arrogant...some of them were pretty nice, though. There wasn't much opportunity for advancement. It was steady, but not really the kind of environment that I could see myself in long term."
good,"It was a great place to work for. Some supervisors were very rude. The only real problem was that they didnâ€™t care if you are pregnant and canâ€™t do the same work you did before the pregnancy, they expect you to to get production at 100% or they will write you up. They donâ€™t mind firing you for not being able to work the same way whether your pregnant or not."
good,"the work isnt hard at all its the annoying customers who come in and destroy the place"
good,I liked working there and learning new things about their products. We had weekly products we had to study and try to promote with each incoming order.
good,This job was almost 15 years ago so too long ago to leave an accurate review.  I am sure much has changed since I worked there and therefore don't see much value in leaving a review today.
good,This is a work from home customer service job. I take phone orders from customers also filed parcel loss claims on missing packages. Working from home is not bad.
good,"lots of pettty infighting, gossip. People were very cutthroat to each as far as customers. Security was lax, not by choice of the associates, but by the corporation."
good,"My position had evolved into a non challenging position consisting of report publishing and my voice was never heard.  NM is an old company with old ideas and old technology,  It seems they are too afraid to invest in their own future."
good,"If you have managers that have your back when you stand by store policy, the job is good.  If the manager allows himself/herself to be bullied by the customer, you will be metaphorically thrown under the bus, publicly."
good,The Company is great to work for as a whole. Its a family orientated Company. The sales associates in different Departments are great to work with and very friendly. The benefits are great; vacation pay and holiday pay.
good,The work isnt very hard but if management doesnt like you they can make you have a really hard time. When everything is going well its a decent place to work. Not alot of time for ovetime though
good,"Good vibes and understanding on travel/time off. As long as you give warning, will allow you to take future days off. High energy, busy environment, always something to do, although low compensation."
good,It is a good company that does provides work/life balance. There are few areas that provide growth within the company. It seems that one must leave if growth is what they are seeking.
good,"This is a great company it's very flexable down side is the hours are not vary. Great benefits nice and friendly people, I would definitely recommend this job"
good,"Overall, manage online customer's and store's orders. Support managers in their departments by helping with putting items back where they belong and making sure they have the appropriate price tag displayed. Also, help keep the stockrooms well maintained and organized. Hang, steam, label and deliver new merchandise to the appropriate department on a daily basis. I've learned a lot about the logistic of retail and what goes on in the shipping and receiving end of this type of business. I enjoy working with my coworkers and appreciate how supportive and helpful they are. Hardest part of the job is when staff is low and there isn't enough help for one person to do the job. The most enjoyable part of the part is working with well rounded coworkers."
good,"Great work/life balance. "
good,"You learn a lot about retail and business.  This is a great jumping off point for a career in the merchant world. There are some opportunities for advancement, but do not plan to make a decent salary for the first 5 years of your career."
good,"one can learn about a great way of treating customers. Management constantly changes, coworkers are nice, meeting huge daily sale goeals could be very challenging."
good,Slow environment to work in. Co-workers are fun and friendly people.The hardest part of the job is having a slow day and not much to do.
good,Top of the line in retail...great company to work with if you want to work in that industry...
good,"typical work day would be to come in and get started on unloading trucks and separating boxes on the correct assembly line. once done assign proper tags to each box to be shipped correctly, shortly after scan on each box and push to be shipped out correctly. the hardest part of the job was unloading which is the first part of them job which makes the day easier once finished. the most enjoyable part is the scanning and pushing across the lines.my co workers were the best and made the day of work a great day of work."
good,"As long as you do this, you'll be fine. LOVE your job and you will advance, realize you don't love Fashion, forget it."
good,"A typical day would start off opening Fed Ex boxes customers return for credit and checking it for damages and defects. I learned a lot working at Neiman's about the fashion industry. Management was ok, but could be a lot better about caring more about employees than   meeting production goals. Co-workers are ok, easy to get along with."
good,A typical work day....
good,"OK place to work for a self starter.  Working on legacy technologies is challenging, but rewarding if progress can be made.  New leadership is bringing new ideas to solve hard problems."
good,I enjoy everyday coming to work.  Management is top-notch and I feel empowered to make decisions to better our team.  I wish our financial outlook was more positive.
good,"Not exciting, time drags pretty bad.. "
good,There is little room for growth but flexible and decent compensation.  You must be a strong seller and have some competency with technology. Good management.
good,Great place to get a good understanding of a retail business. Its a very corporate culture with lots of proper processes and procedures which is great for development.
good,I love the job but I don't like my crew and supervisor I would like if the job was mon-friday but overall is a good jobt. The hours are 7 am -11 and sundsys I work 8 hours
good,"The retail industry can be extremely competitive, especially when its a commission based environment. The inconsistency with sales can be very challenging and I'm ready for a change in my career."
good,Beautiful products which made it so much easier to work with for costumer's approval. Enjoyed working with all the customers from other countries and well to do.
good,"retail isn't what it use to be, but Neiman marcus is still one of the best to work for. It's like any other job if you complain and don't put in effort, then what do you expect."
good,experience provides insights to all levels of the buying world. Great open environment resulting in a team effort across all levels. Good development program for new hires.
good,The company is going through updates/changes. Change is good. Many customers do not like change. This can affect service ratings. An unfavorable rating due to company policy changes are often not factored into the rating system.
good,Its unlike your typical call center whereas you work from home. I learned that not all customers with money have bad attitudes and some of the wealthiest people are the nicest.The hardest part of this job for me was telling customer no. The most enjoyable part was shopping with the customers and seeing how they spend their money.
good,"organizaciÃ³n, buen horario de trabajo, beneficios bien"
good,"interacting with customers;"
good,The company has gone through a lot of financial hardship and changes which has changed the dynamic of the job.  We used to be looking forward and now we are constantly spinning our wheels to figure out how to get it right.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is to make good desserts and make people happy. The harderst part of the job is when you dont feel to be appreciated with the work that you put in the company or the restaurant.
good,"I learned how to pack object "
good,Assist with customers orders and different disputes on purchases and previous bills. I learned to manage my time correctly and picked up skills on how to converse with unreasonable and upset customers and how to calm the situation. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with those unreasonable customers and managing the situation. The most enjoyable part of the job would have been the comfort of being in my own home doing my job.
good,"Although the pay starts pretty low.  It does indeed grow the longer you work with them. Working from home can be a bit of a challenge, but something you can easily accomplish once you are used to it."
good,One of the greatest aspects of working at Neiman Marcus was the diverse employment base and the opportunity to expand your personal and professional growth through the partnership with these individuals
good,"It is a high end retail job.  Pay is not exceptional, about $13/hour."
good,"I enjoyed working with nice and friendly people."
good,I enjoy working for Neiman Marcus. Upper management could use a little of polishing but all in all they listen to your needs and conduct the store as is required by our corporate office. I work with a great team and everyone is always willing to help and go the extra mile. Interaction with the sales associates and helping them with their needs is usually never a problem. The higher management rewards us numerously when deserved and reminds us that we are in asset to the operations of Neiman Marcus.
good,"Meet and greet customers with a kind, courteous, and helpful attitude. Perform duties required for opening and closing department such as opening registers, stocking displays and supplies, balancing registers at closing, and ensure department is presentable for clientel. Outbound calls to clients to inform them of upcoming events and preferred inventory items requested by clients. Attend store meetings every morning to stay updated on store events, review the latest trends, and information and contest presented by various vendors. Work closely with clients on developing a style for weddings, charity events, award ceremonies, and everyday life."
good,I didnâ€™t to much enjoy working here they expect so much for the little pay they donâ€™t really care to much about your health makes you feel like your back in high school with all the rules
good,Overall working to Neiman Marcus was a great learning. Had an amazing manager who was very hands on with me but one of things about working there was I feel that at the pay I started at wasnâ€™t enough for everything the job entail for you do. Could tend to be very stressful and demanding.
good,"I have learned to be self-sufficient and goal driven. In the environment such as Neiman Marcus creating a positive personal experience for each patron is key to success with the company. We are not just cashiers, make-up artist, or stylish. Associate of the company set the tune, lift the spirit, and help bring to life the vision our customers see but may not be able to bring together on their own. The hardest part of the job is not seeing it as just a job. The most enjoyable part is feeling like you are in control of your career and can change someone's day for the better."
good,"they were very cruel for no commucation copertaive each other likely high school kids gossip too much everywhere at N.M. Direct.."
good,Placing order and checking on orders. Helping customer on finding products in the website and making payments. bilingual calls as well. any assistance to the customer
good,"Working at Neiman Marcus has been a positive experience.  The division in which I work provides stability and a good work/life balance with the opportunity to be among good people. However, the culture is extremely hierarchical with little room for advancement.  At some juncture you must choose between moving on or stagnation."
good,I started at Neiman Marcus Last Call in August 2017 and a month later we found out they were closing our store in November. It was pretty good while it lasted. They do not operate on commission so it is not too competitive and everyone works together rather than fighting each other to make a sale. Benefits were also good the discount works on top of all other discounts. And they gave me a severance package even though I had only started a month before we found out we were closing.
good,"The problem at Neiman Marcus is that while they offer a good commission base paid, this creates a culture of unfair competition, envy, back stabbing, semi-violent confrontations. I do not recommend this place to work if you don t have thick skin."
good,"There is room for advancement at this job. It's not a hard job, but you should be aware that this company is or will be having a lot of layoffs. I do not think that it is stable employment for the future. Otherwise, the job is a typical retail job."
good,styling clients was the best part because i took them out of their comfort zone. It was so cool to help people find a different side of theirselves. i really enjoyed it
good,Enjoyable work place. A company that values customer service and their employees. Always provides recognition for hard work and efforts. Management is approachable and allows you to provide and suggest and new ideas. Constantly learning about the latest fashion trends.
good,"Management is great, friendly, knows how to get a team to cooperate and execute a good business. Friendly work environment, good people, overall the NMG is a good place to work for."
good,It is who you know not what you know. The only good thing is i meet some new people but i have more bad things to say than good. I wish not to say but my boss he had a great heart.
good,"a typical day at work is coming in the morning and excited to start working. everyone there are very friendly and very helpful if you dont understand what your suppose to do they are all willing to give you a hand and direction.the co-workers were very decicated to their job duties and very friendly, the most enjoyble part was meeting different kinds of people and also the pecks of we employees having opportunity for the dicount that was offfered to us."
good,Typical day is 9 - 6
good,"I learned the retail computer system and business strategy of designer quality merchandising . My co-workers were extremely competitive and professional. Our efforts were directed towards great customer service and making our goals. We were all team players.The hardest part of the job was getting requested merchandise and maintaining a customer base. The pay scale was not dependable due to the draw system and payback commissions on returned items sold. Most employees at Neiman Marcus work long hours for low pay and fear being dismissed due to high goal requirements and the commission system. Also, with continued management turnover there was lack of support for the department team. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in a beautifully displayed enviornment. The Neiman Marcus clientel is upscale, educated and enjoyable to help."
good,It Was Alright to Work @ Neimans Marcus Good Paid Holidays & Vacation Short of Staff to Help in Shipping & Receiving Department 6 Paid National Holidays
good,"The job is fairly easy, it is the same thing over an over. Management is not there for you when you need them, such as when conflicts arise. They also nit pick things that are not really important."
good,"I have been with this company for almost 14 years, When I first started working for the Company it was a great, you loved coming in to work, but times have changed, owners have changed and its not the  same company that I started working for years ago.  The management team who I work with arey great, and are also willing to help you when needed.  The benefits are really good and you get paid vacations, but since the cut  our hours like a lot of companies the moral has gone way down, we are short staffed, and we are overwhelmed. I  understand cutbacks I have worked in retail for a really long time.  Overall I have to say working for this company I have learned a lot and have grown over the years they truly do train you really well. To be with a company for as long as I have should say something about this company and that they do have quite a few employees that have stayed with the company a long time.     Unfortunatly I need more hours then what I am working so I am trying to find something else.I would definitly recommend someone for this company if they are looking for a job that is part time or short hours.  Like I said it is a good company, but  I need more hours, So I am looking to move on."
good,A day at Neiman Marcus was great. few management was understandable.The hardest part was pep and trying to maintain it
good,My typical day of work pulling merchandise with a MHE Radio headset.
good,"i have been here working without stress and it's was nice to meet new people there...most of them became like my family and the management was so clear about communication, they have been making people understood what was the process"
good,Been there for 2 years and have no complaints however the company just made some job cuts which has people worried. The management team is very lenient and works very hard to relieve employees of stress.
good,My time in cosmetics was some of the best of my life but I had a family and it no longer worked for that balance that I was looking for.  I have friends from those years though that will last me the rest of my life.  I am grateful for the experience and still think the world of most of the people I worked with.
good,"Shipping and Recieving . Mailroom , The Atmosphere, The co workers are good to work with . This was a contract job. The managment staff was nice and friendly"
good,I enjoyed working here. I had an amazing boss as well as co workers. There were often times celebrities would come in to shop so you never knew who you were going to meet from day to day.
good,Working at Neiman's taught me the in's and out of the fashion industry. I met many famous designers and enjoyed every minute of it.
good,"I like the opportunity Neman Marcus gave me to make lasting relationship with fellow co-workers."
good,"order filler. this job was very easy it was just the employees, they were really really lazy and did not want to help others."
good,A typical day would be for me to arrive to work and proceed to my department and check my work to do list.
good,"You may have a big success at NM, only if you will developed a loyal customers to work with."
good,"Job is good but it's also a lot of unprofessional things that occur for instance, pay check and changing hours at last minute."
good,"this is the best company ever alot of great benefits!There are alot of jobs in this work area,and you can always move up to something bigger and better.Great teamwork."
good,It was fun being part of a team the got to open up a brand new store. Stock and receiving is tedious and A MUST in PAYING ATTETION TO DETAIL. overall it was okay.
good,"I loved it there.  I learned a lot about customer service . got a lot of compliments from customers  and  received  recognition award from management .only because I took that extra step.,  with staff as well as customers.   "
good,"Being that it was my first job as an adult we both had a lot to learn to assist people in different way. And we both had areas of opportunities to better. I learned that a management team should work together and show empathy in order to be a leader and have a successful team. However, the people I worked with were amazing."
good,The work could be slow at times and they had very high turn around with very little job security. Other than that it was a fun place to work.
good,very competitive work environment.  Employees work against each other making a hostile work environment.  I enjoyed the ability to build a very large clientele base. I was able to develop friendships with my customers while maintaining a professional relationship.
good,"A good place to work with benefits and 401K. My day starts with unloading a truck hat has four to five pallets of merchandise a day and then we check the shipment with a receiving report, unpack the boxes and get the merchandise out. We make sure that each piece of clothing is steamed and has the appropriate tag with the SKU and price."
good,I like working here but there no room to grow are mover up with the company.
good,"Overall the culture was good for a retail company, and managers are treated fairly.  There was too much focus on growth at the corporate level which impacted the stores.  It became to hard to reach goals, with not enough staff in the stores."
good,"Neiman Marcus was a typical commission only retail environment with all the ups and downs that that entails. I learned about many quality fashion lines and how they make their numbers. Management was supportive but powerless when it comes to pay. The workplace culture could be tough but there was a level of respect in our department. The hardest part of the job was making money with no control over returns. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting designers like Victoria Beckham, Zac Posen, Stacy Bendet and the Olson twins. I enjoyed hearing their perspective on their collections and how they put them together."
good,"Everyone has their opinion of retail and commissioned sales. As for mine with NM, the environment can be toxic and stressful at times. Other times it is a wonderful place to go above and beyond for your customers. I wish the employees were held to a higher standard and more professional in a luxury setting."
good,"retail just isnt what it used to be! People dont shop in store unless you have something extremely enticing to offer them. Hope the retail industry takes a turn for the better, instead of the worse."
good,"Had a lot of fun working the sales floor, loved the people working there but was hard and long hours during the holidays."
good,"Seasonal Retail..  Sale of merchandise on a daily base. Customer Service, product knowledge, merchandise lookup and replacements."
good,"Employees have excellent comradery and make days fun!  Management isn't the best as they set employees up to fail. The build false expectations and lie to lure you in and once you're employed you soon realize the promise are all false."
good,"need to be a go getter. ready to work long hours and sell sell sell. management changes the rules on a daily basis.  there are lots of nice people to work with and to meet as you work there is no balance of life, late nites weekends and holidays."
good,"As a Veteran, I have been through some things no one should have to do, but at NM the associates are not appreciated. PERIOD."
good,"Top 10 ranked NM sales revenue earner for 2012, $1.5 million in sales, 10% increase over LY."
good,"I enjoyed my job at Neiman Marcus, I liked building displays and filling the shelves.  I like the client tell at my location.  I left the company due to my direct manager.  The corporate office did try to get me and others to stay."
good,"Fun place to work."
good,I usually take over 100 calls a day.  Ranging from your basic address change to the locate my package that was sent weeks ago.  I have learned so much about credit which helps me in my personal life.   The hardest part of the job is being under paid for all that I'm responsible for on a daily basis.
good,"Neiman Marcus is a well managed facility. Working for this company was challenging. I am a very well adjusted employee, and a stickler of the rules. Therefore the fit at Neiman was a good fit."
good,After January we don't get as many hours because it tends to slow down after the holidays. We may work 2 to 4 hours a day. If you don't work 40 hrs you can't get benifits. You have to get a certain amount of stars each week if not your points will go down. You have to sell a product with each customer you speak with.
good,"Neiman Marcus is a high-end retail clothing provider.  A typical day in the Human Resources Department involved interviewing, hiring and/or training new hires, designing and/or providing manager training. There would also be statistical reporting, performance reviews either as an annual function or through preparation of  performance documentation for files.  Policy writing and/or updating was often required."
good,Everyone was very polite and friendly.The human resources direct is wonderful. The holidays are very demanding. Very high quality is expected. Customers are very demanding.
good,Great co-workers. They have their own cafeteria that serves three different cultures of food. Their employee discount was awesome! Especially when they doubled the discount certain times of the year.
good,"the environment is fine, but i am ready to move on. The culture is difficult at times, but at the end of the day i have enjoyed working here, I am just ready to move on."
good,Neiman Marcus Online is a very fast paced working environment.  Being on the phones 8 hours a day and then moving to chats/emails is a challenging position.  I learned to prioritize what needed to be done.  And the best part of Neiman Marcus Online was being able to work from home.
good,"Filter clientele by designers, purchase history, merchandise choices etc."
good,"Nice experience dealing with world wide customer base.  The name was recognized by most people.  The dept mgr was super professional and wonderful to deal with."
good,Big focus on clientele and building business. Can be very slow at times. Very friendly coworkers despite the mean and snoody misconceptions. Great perks and sales incentives. Pretty good benefits. Mid-high turn over rate in management.
good,"The management of the department at the time was hard to work for. An ability to advance was made available that worked better with my schedule but the department manager would not allow me to leave her department because of my sales history and clientele being so high. It was a smart business move on her end, but was ultimately the reason I had to leave as the schedule became too taxing."
good,This store is full with amazing products and good quality. They are always giving intensive training to their employees about new products and customer service. You meet the designers face to face and really get to know their products.
good,"The company distributes some of the grandest fashion brands in the world and the prestige that comes with working at the house is immense. The hardest part working at this job is having to have a work phone and therefore being on- call to your associates and being on demand for your clients. Its difficult balancing work and personal time when each text or phone call is a sale which leads directly to your compensation. The best part about working at this job is being able to sell the entire store to your client, you're not restricted to selling your home department."
good,enjoyed working at this company great opportunities never had anything negative to say about neimn marcus took care of their employees.
good,"Managers strive to teach/show every aspect of the business, and encourge employees to use the knowledge."
good,"it is a nice short term job to have. a diverse environment, that believe strongly on employees opinions to improve company."
good,"My favorite part of working at Neiman Marcus was with a great team in our department.  The support of each other helped us with difficult customers."
good,Nice clean studio with updated equipment. The people are great to work with. The shooting schedule is quite aggressive. It's a good place to get into the product photography business.
good,Neiman-Marcus offered a variety of challenges in the position. No two days were alike and I learned quickly to think on my feet. Management was hands off and gave room to grow and learn. The workplace culture was relaxed but refined. The hardest part of the job was the lifting and moving large objects. The most enjoyable part was helping people with the store merchandise.
good,"Good company to work for, retail is in trouble though. Company is still growing through the major initiatives. Getting to the goal of 750M EBITA will be a task for all of the leadership by 2021"
good,A typical day at work was ok. I didnâ€™t learn very much.Management was ok.The hardest part of the job was working the Conveyor lines and loading trucks.The most enjoyable part of the job was the order fulfillment. Filling out the items ordered off the internet.
good,"On production, competitive yet paid fair just didn't give enough hours but does give paid sick days , holidays as well just doesn't communicate very well"
good,"Excellent training, benefits and perks. Lots of events, fashion shows, etc... to attend and a very nice environment to work in, as far as retailers go. Promotions are very competitive, but hard work is rewarded."
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company"
good,"Neiman Marcus (Downtown Dallas) was a pleasant experience.  Through my experience working as a cashier for Neiman Marcus, I was able to interact with people from a multitude of departments (corporate food service, executives from cosmetics, couture, fashion design, buyers, marketing, accounting and financial executives).  At times, you may have a normal work day, but the food service and retail industry really do not have typical work days at all (charity events, private parties, in-house special events, and etc.).  The holidays tend to be a little chaotic, but you give all your time and energy to maintain that level of customer service that is expected from a high-end retail store such as Neiman Marcus."
good,"unloading clothing pricing, packing and sending cloths to different stores.   customer orders wrapping and sending to customers. mandatory overtime. sorting and hanging cloths in order"
good,Excellent customer service skills for internal and external individuals. Exceeding all expectations internally and externally.understanding following management direction will lead to success for the store employees and most importantly the customers.
good,the people that worked there were very nice. There was always some training set up for you to gain experience. Lots of free lunches. People loved to celebrate special occasions
good,"NM was very corporate and the culture was very uptight and dressed to impress. Work life balance really depends on your supervisor, I overall did not have much complaints. Work is demanding and stressful especially when the company was struggling financially."
good,"Very rewarding company, i really enjoyed working here i just wish there was better management and recources when there is problems going on on the job."
good,"great position for customer service representative. a fast-paced call center, which means company may not have adequately staffed the position. Therefore, you will be constantly taking calls. If you earn a free holiday off day for working (for example Christmas), although your average daily hours are 8 hours, they will only pay you for 4 hours. "
good,"Fantastic company to work with, benefits are great. "
good,"Great place to work. It was a fast paced, stressful number driven place to be. Your only as good as your last good day. There is no work/life balance. If you asked for to change your schedule due to upcoming appointments for your or child, they made you feel uncomfortable like your asking too much. Best part was the discount. Worse part was no job growth and advancement."
good,"in the returns department its a friendly environment, management no so great, but as far as the work its simple and repetitive. pay is 11.50 but could increase based off production."
good,Management needs training in customer service. Not professional or organized. Morale is low for employees. I enjoy assisting my clients with their purchases. flexible schedule.
good,"I appreciated the trust I earned as a L.P./key holder which led to the responsibility of, not only, opening & closing the store but also being ""on call"" in the event of emergency or should the alarm sound during after hours.  I was also responsible for communicating with vendors regarding deliveries and soon responsibilities went beyond what I was originally hired for; which included weekly walk-throughs with the manager to discuss visual displays, window presentation and even guest services which was not part of my job description and yet oftentimes, unappreciated but still expected."
good,Very nice working conditions with many trunks shows to give good sales opportunities. Basically a commission-only atmosphere with a draw against Commission.
good,"It is hard dealing with upper management. You have to be able to adapt to change. You have to face work knowing it will be in a stressful environment. Have to commit to long hours. Ultimately the people staff are good people, and will take care of you if you commit to doing a good job."
good,"A typical day at work is enjoyable."
good,Customer base is very savvy so product knowledge is very important and a must! Training available with some gratis. You are basically in charge of your own business. Ready for new challenges.
good,They had a lot of different things they do daily.  Always a new task.  But you always have to be productive or they look at you closely.
good,"The people are amazing and the job is easy. The pay is okay but not great and more importantly the advancement opportunities are few and far between. As far as sales, not recommended for beginner sales jobs. Loss prevention is more auditing than anything else."
good,"Great place to work I was able to get several promotions, but on my 6th year the company went through 2 reorganizations and had to let a lot of associates go and made a lot more work for other associates and management. Most of the staff was not happy anymore. Job security became a big question."
good,Unpacking cloths and place the in size order on the correct hanger. Co-workers were very helpful and worked as a team.I was a very pleasant place to work at. The hardest part was not being certain that  you will work 40 hours weekly.
good,"Full time day of giving excellent customer service and increasing sales. Team work and respect for each other is the way to go. "
good,"Lead the Beauty Sales Effort by assisting the NM Customer, and their needs throughout the Beauty Department."
good,"For Operational Support Team: Very fast paced job, must be ready to learn and be fast. Key employees inside a store, every aspect of the business is mostly done by the support team."
good,Neiman Marcus is a great company. We ensure all employees are focused on providing exceptional customer service in a welcoming atmosphere.
good,"Everyday was an interesting day. Leadership, listening, guiding, inventory, scheduling and working with a diverse culture."
good,"Fast-paced environment where motivating a team of sales associates is the priority. Interaction with all levels of management in the purpose of achieving sales plans.Through this position, I was able to develop my leadership skills and ability to meet goals and deadlines."
good,"A typical day at work is composed of working with vendors to better understand the businesses that the buying offices manage, accurately examining financial information and writing, uploading orders for the upcoming season. I learned a lot about how to run a business, and even more about how to negotiate in retail."
good,If you love fashion this is a great place to work. Not the easiest company to advance in.
good,Overall a positive work environment. A good place to work. Lessons learned over the past year of what it takes to start up a brand new facility.
good,"People I worked with were very professional and lovely.  Learned a lot, grew as a professional. The location of the store is not the best because the mall is so crowded or it was very difficult to park or get out of the parking lot. Overall a great experiece to have worked at that company."
good,A high paced job. Busy busy busy but great! Customer service is number one with our store.
good,"Great Company to work with, really took care of their employees.  Always great moral in the company all the way to the top."
good,"great clients, fashion forward. Employees are helpful and good staff."
good,"The staff worked as a team "
good,Very dynamic enviornment that moves very quickly with the demands of the retail enviornment.
good,"I work with a varied group of individuals at work, most of whom get along very well together. Being a part of the management team of the store, I help to make decisions involving merchandising, scheduling employees, handling delicate customer situations, etc. I have learned that although Neiman Marcus has many excellent qualities, I am no longer interested in working the constantly varying schedule that most retail environments demand. My job is certainly not difficult, and the best part of my job is working with both great people and great fashion."
good,"Selling, clientele building, phone work, setting up events, making and exceeding goals, setting up contests for selling associates."
good,I inspected the material and packed the material and shipped it out. How to work well in an group environment. Management team was caring an understanding of employees needs. Team-members were diffcult but fun to work with in the environment. The hardest thing about the job was the production goals. Meeting and exceeding my goals when it came to the goal set for production.
good,This 100+ year old company sees itself as the sales leader for luxury goods. Many of the employees are very tenured.
good,"â€¢Accept incoming merchandise in an efficient, and organized manner."
good,there are plenty of opportunities throughout the week to gain product knowledge. weekly meetings are held from your store to keep you up to date on important information. you get the chance to meet plenty of vendors.
good,I worked there for 7 1/2 years. Things went really well at first. Then they changed the sales goals and pitted everyone against each other. High Drama. The supervisor for the last 3 years was the worst supervisor I had in my life. She was eventually fired. She was extremely unfair and had her few little favorites.
good,Fast paced work environment.  A lot of employees with a lot of different personalities and cultures. Can be challenging and stressful. Long shift hours.
good,Great Talent Acquisition Director and Manager. Unorganized Processes and systems. Compensation is below average. Recruiting jobs are not stressful but the contract compensation is again below average. Squeezing every dollar.
good,"It's not the same company it use to be. Over the years, company loyalty to it's current employees has changed.  Neiman's use to be big on promoting from within the company.  Now, they look to bring in people from outside the company."
good,"Because there is a lack of foot traffic, you must call your customers to sell them products over the company provided cell phone.  Depending on what you send out to your customers, almost half gets returned in my case.  "
good,"Nice. The training lasted about 4 weeks. You could choose your own hours working from home. A lot to learn, but worth it. Training was easy at times, but if you had a difficult moment the instructor was very available to explain and made sure you understood. Taking live calls became easier and easier each time you took a call."
good,"My overall feeling about Neiman was good as far as pay,perks and advancement opts. My main gripe with the company was their lack of support for the employees, specifically in terms of theft or fraud which was pretty rampant because of the stores luxury items. When things were stolen or considered fraud they almost make you seem like you are guilty of not doing enough to stop it. As a sales rep you are only allowed to do so much within the guidelines to help prevent it. At one point employees were being suspended and written up left and right and having their lively hoods  threatened because they felt we were aggressive enough with people. I didnt know what they expected us to do? actually tackle and detain possible thieves or suspected fraud? It became ridiculous and very uncomfortable"
good,"Neiman Marcus will promise any delivery time AND take the extra money for the expedited delivery charge. Then you will get a Thank-you email with Caveat the delivery ""May"" be delayed. They have excuses not discussed prior to the sale. I am on day 4 of a OVERNITE delivery that has not even been given a tracking number. Their current excuses? Gift wrapping delay, coming from a ""store"" vs...what? All excuses I should have been made aware of before I chose to depend on when I bought and paid for next day delivery. Now they cannot cancel the sale either so the package will sit on a porch - if it's ever delivered. My problem if it's stolen off porch. Another expensive coat was delivered on time last eek BUT had white dog hairs all over it and the zipper was stuck. Apparently a return not checked at all.....Ugh. BUY ELSEWHERE!!!!!"
good,"I loved working for NM!"
good,"Only experience is working in back of house as an online merchandiser. Pretty simple job you receive orders for clients, find the items and send them to the client. You respond to emails, phone calls from other stores and stay in direct contact with the shipping department."
good,"Selected products for specific routes according to pick sheets. Unloaded, picked, staged and loaded products for shipping. Conducted monthly, quarterly and yearly inventories of warehouse stock. Received incoming shipments and reviewed contents against purchase order for accuracy. Rotated stock by code and receiving date. Transported goods from racks, shelves and vehicles. Installed protective bracing, padding and strapping to prevent shifting and damage to items during transport. Worked at a rapid pace to meet tight deadlines"
good,The people I work with make the job easy to deal with. I enjoy working with my co workers. But the company as a whole makes decisions that are not usually helpful for company moral.
good,"Difficult culture to work with.  Half of the employees are full commission and half are not.  Dog eat dog environment. The management is wonderful to work for.  It is just very hard to work side by side with those on full commission,"
good,"Its a retail job, so the schedule is constantly changing. Neiman Marcus is very upscale, so there are constantly new events going on each day. I enjoy working with the company, and the people that work there. Great family atmosphere."
good,I was able to move to a variety of different high end cosmetic / skin care lines and it helped me become well versed in sales and become a successful sales person / manager.
good,the day consisted of pulling items from shelves to fill customers orders being that it was my first warehouse job it was a learning experience. the coworkers was fun to be around good laughs and also loved learning from the elder employees.
good,"Typical 8 to 10 hour workdays, management is great, co-workers also are good. Learned how more about fraud investigations,and customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping clients/victims prevent their accounts from be compromised."
good,"standing long periods,, i learned how to properly tagg merchandise,,hardest part of this job i would say would of been it was not air in the warehouse, favorite part of the job was seeing diffrent clothing, shoes and other items"
good,Day to day tasks change and provide for fantastic opportunities to challenge how you approach situations presented.  I have enjoyed not knowing what to expect from each day.
good,"Very slow pasted workplace, even though it is a retail job. The affluence is not much. Very personal and one on one type of retail experience, the customer is really pampered and made sure all their needs are taken care of"
good,the staff is great to work with. mornings start and 9ish and you leave right at six. if you close your day starts at 12 and you leave at 9. the co workers are very helpful and are willing to help with what you need.
good,"best hours offered in the retail world, friendly work environment, managers willing to take the time to teach you and invest in your future."
good,Fun work environment in way of working with customers. Team work is a daily thing.  Did daily reports and calling buyers for merchandise and store needs.
good,"Shipping and receiving, gift wrapping orders, verifying invoices and packing slips, and incoming products, inventory control, data entry, and processing shipping documents"
good,"I have worked for this company for 7 years and there have been many changes. The management level needs to be revaluated due to communication issues between managers & personnel. The company in general is pleasant, has incentive rewards for their sales associates. Our department has a great team of workers & their attitudes have been the highlight of my working experience within the company. We all get along & work with each other."
good,"Assisting and building new client relations. Selling and demonstrating various products. Create and provide Spa Events. "
good,"Clock in, pickup work orders. Read and process orders. unpack product and tag and inspect. Repack product."
good,"If you like commission and fashion this is the best place to work.  Great incentive to promote selling."
good,Store launch at a difficult time. Philosophy would be great during better economic times. Beautiful environment. Everything is based on productivity.
good,"Event driven sales environment, with the leading luxury brands as a means. Excellent product training and development, Supportive management and executives, and the industry's best as your team!"
good,the company have a diverse culture and the enjoyable part of the job is the peoples I work with. the company also offer incentive doing holidays. the hardest part of the job is making production sometime.
good,"When I started with the company it used to be fun to go into work, I would look forward to it. Then they started to get rid of people that were the heart of the company. It was no longer a good place to work..."
good,I received merchandise and had to make sure that they followed governmental guideline such as furs and leathers that were allowed in the u.S. I also had to go through merchandise and make sure that what was presented on their website meet quality standards.My manager had faith in me that I would do high quality WORK AND HE HARDLY EVER HAD TO FOLLOW UP .seeing THE AMAZING MERCHANDISE THAT CAME THROUGH OUR FACILITY
good,It was a nice place to work but draw vs commission is hard to live on. I like a consisitent paycheck and it was hard to sell with the lack of product they had.
good,"I enjoyed most of the people I worked with there, and loved being surrounded by beautiful merchandise. A nice team atmosphere and department support. Goal oriented and vendor training expanded the history and specialty department knowledge."
good,"Luxury brand name in retail chain.  Work ethics is good. The product they sell online will be never seen before. Custom make bikes, cars, contemporary apparel and custom merchandise."
good,I enjoyed working for Neiman Marcus and would have stayed with the company if they could have worked with me when my grandfather became ill. My job consisted mainly of packaging materials to be shipped out.
good,"I felt at home working at Neiman Marcus. Unfortunately, the job security and advancements are not there. The company continues to go through changes, from reorganization and budget cuts, competitive online business that hurts the brick and mortar business and some processes that do not make the best sense, Neiman Marcus has its fair share of struggles."
good,Neiman Marcus was a client first organization.  The client was always first which was the culture of the entire store.  Having the flexibility to always strive to please the client was rewarding
good,"Typical day is with morning meetings and putting away stock, the management is great, the atmosphere is also great.  The best part of my job is that I have the ability to make people happy and feel good with the purchases they make, the job can be a bit stressful at times but overall great place."
good,I learned how to work under pressure doing peak times like holidays. the hardest thing was they expected too much for job. also the work place was a great place for security.
good,"Fun place to work but little opportunity for advancement.   Like any job it has its good days and bad,  Some managers are great, others lack positive encouragement."
good,"If you are down for a very fast paced and challenging career, Neimans is for you. The commission work can get very competitive which in turn can make you resent the people you work with"
good,You can definitely build a stable career at this place of work
good,"commissioned sales. aggressive competitive coworkers .beautiful store, great merchandise. store discount. I learned exceptional customer service standards at this retailer."
good,"The scope of the position I hold allows me to continue my growth and development in Operations and LP.  I am supported by my GM and by corp partners.  "
good,"I worked for Neiman Marcus for almost 4 years and only was able to make one upward move. After that, all management positions were noticeably not growing. If you want to move up here you either have to wait for someone to retire, quit, or get fired. New positions were very rare within the company."
good,This was a work from home position. The hours were chosen as a part of a schedule and then were sometimes offered during holidays but you either worked Christmas day or Thanksgiving day. Very little room for advancement. And hours could be cut if they had too many people on hold.
good,"This company does a solid job of creating an opportunity in retail, in CO. It's a competitive environment and the team was geared around selling professionals."
good,"I enjoyed working at Neiman Marcus call center.  I started as a customer service associate and about three months in, I was transferred over to the Credit Hold department.  That was an interesting position because i got to learn the operations on the back side after an order was placed and got the opportunity to meet people from all over the country, over the phone that is.  I worked there for a little over two years and really enjoyed every moment."
good,Retail business is not in a good shape now but I still like working there. I have worked there for more than 9 years starting as full-time and now part-time. The management there is always good.
good,"I worked at Last Call. It was a great starting place and you learn a lot. Paid time off is accumulated, so the more you work the more paid time off you accumulate. Some benefits are only offered to part time or full time employees though most employees are considered short hour. Regardless, the 30% off discount is amazing."
good,"I was a work from home associate. It was nice logging in at home and talking to customers. I learned that a hello, thank you, and have a nice day go a long way. It can be the difference in a pleasant conversation or a not so pleasant one. The hardest part of the job was sometimes not being able to talk to a customer or a manager face to face. The most enjoyable part of the job was just talking to the customers."
good,Love being able to see all the new fashion that is out.  Love working around all my lovely co workers. Days can be stressful but everyone around you makes it happier and easier.
good,"the  Finest luxury retailer, fashion leader in usa,"
good,"The pay can be better, but the people I work with are cool. i would prefer a set schedule, but when working in retail its to be expected. management isnt too bad either."
good,"Greatest part of the job is the people. Management is great about communicating plans, transitions, etc. The worst thing is the micro-managing."
good,"A typical work day was fun and exciting, especially when it came to helping the customers. I learned several accounting skills such as running and producing reconciliations based on a trial balance.  Management had their perks.  They made sure if you did not know how to do a task pertaining to your job, you were trained.  The co-workers were fun to be around.  The team building atmosphere made working easier.  The hardest part of my job was finding a breaking point when it came to assignments.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with the customers."
good,This was a great place to work for the past year and a half. Each day was different and I met and worked with a lot of wonderful people.
good,"I learned time management during this job. I enjoyed interface with customers and co-workers. The most enjoyable part was be involved with fashion, this was fun. I need more challenging and use my knowledge which I learned before."
good,"As, QA you are almost always guaranteed a full 40 hr. work week. Not very much room for upward movement in the company, and work days can sometimes drag on as the department you do you quality assurance for (receiving, packing, order filling) may go home early and you need to find work, sometimes in other departments, to keep you production level up."
good,"I do enjoy working for Neiman Marcus, a typical day has mixed emotions dealing with the management team. Management could be better though. They do work with my schedule while I'm continuing my education, but it is a struggle to deal with them."
good,"My experience at Neiman Marcus was a good one. I did have a very bad manager at one point but my next manager was great.There can be some 'clickish' behavior, but over all I had some great coworkers and learned so much. Just like any work environment, you have to take the good with the bad.  My work/home life balance was good there.  Benefits are just o.k. My main issue was it was hard for me to advance within the company."
good,"Check-in and Place merchandise on floor ,open register work on displays.I experienced quite a bit being I was here for more than 8 years on and off started in accessories worked my way up to assistant in couture. Then denim specialist in contemporary and personal shopping. I learned to give excellent customer service to keep clients .Management was great co-workers a bit cut throat. The hardest was taking a return and the most enjoyable was visual merchandising."
good,"â€¢a typical day at work- fast pace"
good,"High end fashion in the best enviroment.  Great perks and great benefits.  Not a good work - life balance, and the politics within the work place are a bit hard."
good,"Returns: Folding clothes, checking for stains n any other problems with the material."
good,"It was a pleasure meeting new faces everyday and remembering old faces. "
good,Typical day at Neiman Marcus was processing customers' orders and learning new products.  Management was professional and helpful.  My co-workers were very competitive and helpful.  Hardest part of job was making sales target objectives.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and working in such a beautiful environment.
good,The fashion is amazing!  You work with highly creative educated people.  The customer's are very well traveled and interesting.
good,Good place to learn Work and to know business process.Good co-ordination between co-workers.
good,Neiman Marcus is a great place to work. Friendly people and management.
good,The majority of my day revolves around consistent surveillance and investigating theft and shortages. I audit and report discrepancies in the cash office. I have learned to identify and deal with problematic people and guide associated in following policy and procedures set by company. I work alongside management to achieve the goals of the company by doing my part. My team members and I work closely to achieve a uniform way of completing our tasks. The hardest part of my job is when I come into contact with nice people that make stupid decisions like stealing. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing people from all walks of life and learning interesting little things about them.
good,"I worked at 2 locations for Neiman Marcus in their Zodiac Restaurants, both in the original Downtown Dallas Store and in Boston at Copley Place.  "
good,"Manages designer's line within the store through effective merchandising and promotion. Achieves and exceeds provided monthly sales goals. Develops relationships and communicates with buyers and vendor to ensure success with buyers' picks for the local market."
good,"great team work, excellent client interaction, via e-mail. "
good,I enjoyed working there.  Wasn't there very long.  Skincare line I worked for was taken out of the store.
good,"The Fort Worth is not a ""destination"" stop to shop. Many of the clients come from previous associates books, which makes it hard to start out on a good foot. So if you aren't up for a challenge, this job isn't for you! Many of the summer days have consisted of cold calling, organizing client book, and straightening the floor (anything to keep busy!) The atmosphere is amazing, and it's fun to be ahead in the fashion world!"
good,"Good Management, they take care of you if you need tme off. They train you to be proficient at your job, and there are decent health care benefits if you need."
good,The people are nice to work with.  The company tries to promote a good work/life balance.  It is not always easy to achieve as there is a lot expected of all employees.  Coming in with a positive attitude is best.  Best advice for the long haul at this company: be flexible.
good,Great company culture where there are many fun sponsored events inside the store to promote business. Days where we can dress down if we donate for a cause once a month. Excellent benefits and discount on products. Great coworkers as well as clients. The type of relationships that go beyond professional. Industry leader in using technology to increase business. Excellent company to work for.
good,Working with the company I gained the confidence to work with the public. I'm more comfortable and at ease helping customers solve any issues they may have.
good,The people will delegate all of their work to other people then blame you for not finishing your work and their work. The job was good for building yourself up in the company.
good,Great benefits and employee discount.  Provides work life balance based on business needs.  I appreciate they allow individuality in your personal style preference.
good,"Great Company - very professional, talented and personable Management at all levels ...very client centric, wonderful quality merchandise. It is a delight to work at NM."
good,"I enjoyed my time here, it taught me a lot. I left because of lack of advancement. But overall this is a good place to work. They offer a lot, like health benefits, 401k, flex spending acct. I was on commission only for most of my time there. Therefore, I gave myself raises. They offer lots of sale incentives."
good,"Great place to start a career. It's a good training ground. There is room for growth throughout the company, corporate or retail stores. "
good,"Advancement takes a while, and underpaid. Great work atmosphere and challenge you to do your best. With recent layoffs, work load is too much and quality is down."
good,"Fast paced environment, but great training and management, helpful in anyway, considerate of any recommendations to help do your job better. I excelled in the company very quickly after hire, I have now been in the same position for almost two years, this is the longest position I have held at this company. I am looking to continue to excel in different areas."
good,I love working from home. However pay raises are very slow coming.  During peak season there's not much down time . after peak its hard to get all your hours as there are mandatory time off or early off due to slow down in sales.
good,"One of the truly great brands to work for, customer service is focus #1 for the organization. Recent financial difficulties, but good people to work with."
good,typical retail job. management wasn't the best.  the hours were flexible and the customers were great for the most part. the workplace culture was pretty good.
good,Friendly work environment.  Professional staff.  Flexible hours pus overtime. The job was challenging and fun.  The only reason I left is due to a move.
good,"Sellers are the stars. Sales support less so. As per normal in retail, brick and mortar is taking the brunt of layoffs. Its unfortuante, but it is a good company."
good,"I learned a lot about retail work here!! Also learned the beautiful techniques of wrapping gifts, the shipping and receiving department was great as well."
good,"I enjoyed working with Neiman Marcus. It was a seasonal job"
good,Hours are better than other retail stores.  Friendly work environment.  Good benefits.  Ability to make a good commissioned salary with hard work and perserverence.
good,"What I did was just gift wrap gifts and find the right size for the gift. Some people would purchase big items other small items but just like they were small we had to be very delicate with the items because they were expensive items. We wanted the clients to be satisfied once they give them to their family and friends. "
good,"Great flexible schedule, but no room for growth. When there was a change in management , you could say a lack of professionalism in the back. No training by a manager. Learned things by yourself"
good,"For better or worse, a company with a whole lot of history.  It does a great job maintaining its place in luxury retail, but is ill equipped to stay relevant in the face of both shifting competition and changing customer behavior."
good,"Great people to work with, Very educational"
good,"Typical day at work is fun most people are pleasant."
good,Retail loss prevention is a profession that is responsible for reducing inventory losses inside retail stores.Profit preservation is any business activity specifically designed to reduce preventable losses.
good,"The ability to work from home allows me the flexibility im used to."
good,A huge part of my character and charisma now is due greatly to the work environment in Neiman Marcus. Between the personality of coworkers to the personality of customers. Neimans was great with work hours and benefits. As long as i was on top of my responsibilities no one was on top of me. However management i would say was the only issue i had because it was never consistent there were new managers followed by different management styles every few months or so making it hard to keep up to date with everyone's requirements.
good,"Prepared trunk shows with PR Team for special events."
good,I enjoyed the culture. The product is amazing. Great management. It was a great learning expereince. A lot of fun. It is a place where you can grow and retire from.
good,"In charge of increasing company revenue. I seek to work in a pleasant and professional environment.A typical day was working "
good,"challenging environment with constant new ways to sell introduced by the company,  high stress levels, hard on feet because always standing."
good,"Very nice and pleasant environment. The atmosphere was friendly enjoyed helping the staff and customers. I learned a lot from the staff, making sure the customer was satisfied made my day move very smooth."
good,It was a great learning experience and opportunity to access luxury retail. I personally would recommend company to others who want to move up in the company and actively work towards it.
good,"The pay is great and most of the associates are amazing as well. However it is very hard to advance, and the commission associates are lazy, but expect you to do everything for them to make money."
good,A typical day at Neiman Marcus varies. One day its slow and then other days are busy. New Orleans was a great place to put a Neiman Marcus be cause we got a lot of  tourists and people from conventions/meeting everyday. You never know what kind of day it will be. I learned about the different vendors they carried and whats popular for the season. The co-workers make my day because they are fun yet hard workers and together we all get the job done. Management is ok. The hardest part of the job is getting along with different personalities from the managers to the customers because you can't please everybody. The most enjoyable part of the job was having new shipment come in and participating in all the promo events.
good,Pleasant and friendly work environment. Not as busy as I would like to be. I prefer to be busy from start to finish.
good,Flexible working environment.  They have work from home programs that were flexible and can accomodate any schedule.
good,We would start the day off by unloading the truck. Learn how to do send UPS and FEDEX shipment off. Management would get in on holiday when get back up. when there nothing to do we would help other co-worker out.
good,Fast paced fun full of fashion and haute couture lots to learn and do.
good,"A typical day consists of knowing where we are in sales numbers, doing makeovers whether they are appointments or walk-ups, educating customers on the products, and taking care of Daily Sales Report for each associate.  "
good,"Overall, an enjoyable experience. Making the most out of each day with very little foot traffic. Able to build close relationships. Interesting people. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Neiman Marcus Group. I sat at my desk on the phone with customers most of the day. Wasn't a hard job at all. I enjoyed my coworkers and clients, though some of the management was slightly incompetent. The most difficult thing about working with NMG was the unruly customers. I always dealt with them to my greatest ability, but it just wasn't the fun part of my day. The most enjoyable part of my job was placing orders for clients and helping them choose the correct items."
good,"Overall a great company to work for, great affordable benefits, mostly friendly work environment, steady schedule and work. It is a production-based job that requires attention to detail while being quick with decisions about items being packed (especially returns).  Steady shift work for the most part, especially during PEAK season."
good,"I loved working at Neiman Marcus i have learned a lot of things. You need to love Your job.  In retail you do not get a lot of vacations. You will make friends and enemy. I made friends and made my day enjoyable. You will also have some challenging people to deal with.  This is a place that you earn commission not a an hourly wage. So everybody will be competitive. Itâ€™s nice if you can bring in clients.  You cannot just rely on walk in customers.  Work is challenging since you do not get a lot of traffic. I have no problem with managers, if you are selling them there is no problem.  Problem starts once you cannot make your goal,  But overall i really enjoyed my time at Neiman Marcus"
good,Flexible hours with a commission structure. This store allows you to sell luxury goods from high end makeup to handbags to your client on a commission based structure
good,"I believe that Neiman's helped me develop professionally. I came from a very loose working environment as an art director in New York. I had to learn the importance of company shifts, as I came in during a company-wide system change. I had to learn to be flexible. I had to learn the old and the new system. It made me a better professional. I had an amazing team and an amazing mentor in Nancy Golub."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company as an assistant manager in the Men's Complex. My only issue was with individual people working there, not the company. I would specifically praise their HR department. I worked in the Bellevue location in between 2009-2012"
good,No two days are alike. The work was easy but expectations could be too high at times. Hardest part of the job was getting thrown into a new department with little training.
good,"The job hours typically revolves around 9-6pm.  The manager/office you work in will determine the flexibility of hours.  You will have typical divisional/office meetings, as well as company info meetings on occasion.  You will run reporting/sales, write/speak with vendors on Purchase Order updates.  Email for store request.  "
good,It was an easy job and really good pay. I won awards almost every month. The customers were pushy but with the pay of $12 an hour I didn't care. I hate they started outsourcing cause they fired people immediately almost without notice. Company is a total sell out
good,"Good company to work for. High expectations to meet. Had pride in my work ethic. Only left because of my injury. I was there 13yrs.. good work hours, benefits,and pay.."
good,"environment is super cut throat, have thick skin and you want to be fashionable to be able to sale. I was the assistant to the director there but that was even stressful when it didnt need to be"
good,"Commission only position is grueling because they put too many sales associates on the floor so it becomes cut throat and creates unfriendly, back-stabbing atmosphere between associates. "
good,"good company to work for.  spent over 20 years there"
good,It was wonderful to work from home in my own office. There are many different schedule options and the pay is good. Once you choose a schedule you must stick to those hours and there is not much time off. They are open 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. They actually do not close on holidays either.
good,"Work day starts with a team meeting or learning about a new product line. I learned alot about different lines of cosmetics and lines of skin care, I also learned how lucky I was to work there. My manager was tough, and played favorites with her long time staff, but it didn't really affect my job. Culture at Nieman Marcus was great, it is a respected company, and quality customers. There was really not a hard part of the job, maybe just a few of the other sales staff stealing your customers was hard to take some days. Most enjoyable part of the job was product education, a beautiful place to work, and a mostly friendly work enviornment, oh and lots of free product."
good,"Very limited to promotions, left to pursue a better paid restaurant management position. Great hours since in a retail department store."
good,"I worked at Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills as the Customer Service and Credit Manager for 29 years.  I was responsible for helping customers and ensuring that their shopping experience was happy and positive.  If that was not the situation, I had the authority and responsibility to turn a bad situation into a good experience by making exceptions for that customer so that he or she would continue to come back into the store and spend their money with us."
good,Great place to work for where i learned a lot about accident investigations and safety. Management was questionable but my department manager was very helpful and pushed me to learn. Workplace culture was good. Would recommend to someone else who is looking for warehouse packaging work.
good,"As a salesperson working in Neiman Marcus, it was a bit challenging to hit the daily number since it is all commission based and have to rely on the additional compensation that comes from making sales. Also there is hardly any foot traffic since the products we sell are high fashion and intimidates people to step into the store. But overall, transitioning from working at J.Crew to an up scale retailer at Neiman Marcus was a new and fun experience for me. The experience we provide to each customer we help is the best of the best. I've always loved to work with clothes and helping people look nice, so it was second nature to me. Overall, the most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers and solving problems."
good,"the job is great, flexible with schedule. Pulling orders, enjoy working with great people and also learning new things."
good,"I have been there but the HR and PR are the best departments of the company i find them hardworking and resourceful."
good,"Management offices are always open whenever you need a question answered. They're into production percentages, so you're always constantly having to record everything you're doing."
good,"I drive HR initiatives for the company such as recognition, rewards, performance, recruiting, coaching, discipline and terminations."
good,"love it there, just no space to grow and move up."
good,"Reach out to customers base in order to build wardrobe."
good,At Neiman Marcus the employees are great to work with.  I have learned alot from my manager.  The employee benefits are not that great but the people are awesome.
good,"fast pace, learned to be detailed management i like my coworkers are ok. hardest part of my job is not enough time in the day. i enjjoy staying busy."
good,"Great company"
good,"Productive place to work, learn, and meet great fashion designers"
good,"Fast pace due to being on production"
good,everyone was friendly and helpful from front desk to the coworkers and manager
good,"I was privy to runway shows and meeting and greeting top clothing designers, as well as the store functioning for Benefit Organizations"
good,i loved working for neiman marcus i loved helping clients with any of their needs and i loved working with all kinds of people
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was to feel the satisfaction of the customer after his sale was completed.
good,Enjoyed working at Neimans and learning about the products and services.
good,The hardest part of this job is dealing with the rude customers
good,"As an Assistant Buyer with this company, you will constantly be busy and learn your job very quickly. This position will give you exposure into vendor management, inventory planning, refinement of fashion taste, and time management skills."
good,"Fashion Designer/ Merchandiser position with a dynamic fashion â€“ forward company where I can apply my unique combination of fashion designer training and retail market knowledge and experience to produce collections of stylish, elegant and marketable womenâ€™s wear."
good,I learned more about RF Units and was able to pick up a new skill to apply in the future
good,N/A Awesome supervisor xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,"clientele and you'll do great. get to know suiting etc along with sportswear clothing. lots of product knowledge training available"
good,"although i am coming to an end of my NMG era, it is the best retailer i have worked for. be patient and work hard, a little will go a long way for you"
good,"A very diverse and amazing group of people. With every position taken within the company, I always had enough time to learn new skill sets. They gave me more than enough challenges and coaching. I was rewarded for things they had asked of me and even things that I took upon myself to do to help the team."
good,"Able to dictate the own success of your business. Having said that you may have some slow days, or slower than others. The company is big on technology providing business cell phones to contact your clients."
good,Had 7 years of employment. I worked with a great team and made good relationship with co-workers. I give them a thumbs up. Also nice events of the sales product specialist. Growth to relocate too.
good,"â€¢	Expert knowledge of SQL and relational database management system."
good,Nice to work from home. Could choose your own hours. This was seasonal work. Supervisors were great. Online training and classes were awesome. One of the best customer service representative jobs I've ever had.
good,I work in my station until i get my first 20 minute break. 3 breaks throughout the day is perfect enough for me. Packing clothes and accessories is very easy and manageable.
good,"first job, got support from the superiors and colleagues. got chance to learn so many new technologies,  improved skills after working there. received discounts  on products. it was good learning experience."
good,"My typical workday included servicing clients cosmetic needs and providing optional choices to suit the client before purchase. I learned how to work in a luxury environment while servicing some of Dallas most elite clients. The workplace culture is also a luxury, must be able to present yourself in an environment that lends to its surroundings. The hardest part of the job willing to work holidays and weekends. But that it retail so it should be expected. I enjoyed being able to help clients solve whatever needs they had when they came into the store."
good,Neiman Marcus was a place that hired me when I didn't have a clear cut career path and was at a job with no chance of advancement.  They placed me in a department in which I had no experience based on the fact that they saw something in me.  There have definitely been ups and downs throughout my three and half years of employment with the company.  I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart I would not change it for the world.  I was blessed to have a great manager who has continued to develop me throughout the years and mold me into a young professional.  The culture is unbelievably amazing with people from all nationalities with the biggest smiles and warm hearts.  Unfortunately it is time me to pursue other opportunities in a career with the chance for advancement with that being said I highly recommend anyone who is interested in mail room service to take a long look because it is a great place to work.
good,always on your feet and fast pace. everybody i worked with was very kind and loved to talk. i never had a problem asking for a day off that  couldnt work.
good,This company is a great company to work for and offers great work life balance.  I have truly enjoyed my time at the company.  Hardest issue is company is based in several different buildings which make interaction hard at times
good,"Overall, this is one of the prettiest retail companies to work for.  It is clean and exceptional in many ways."
good,As a Neiman Marcus employee it was very important to provide the best costumer service and give your clients an unforgettable moment. I have learned a lot about building my own clientele and also how to treat costumers and how to solve problems at work.
good,management and all co- workers were very friendly and always willing to help each other. they also jump in to help a customer with the best information.
good,"Learned Product management and sales support techniques. Very fast paced environment, many of the skills learned customer service was indeed the most valued at this company."
good,"the management here is awesome. anytime i had a success they would always tell me great job. they had great team building meetings also, and great trainings"
good,"Typical day was selecting orders to be printed, print the orders, and organize according to ordering dates. key the orders for customers that ordered online and prepare for the warehouse to ship. Also call customers that had incomplete orders or incomplete information on"
good,It is a good place to work. Everyone seems to enjoy each other. It is like working with family. The hardest part of the job would be waking up early in the morning.
good,"Everything was good. can't complain. Same as my last job. i really like working there. Break down the truck, do the our paper work, assists  the managers."
good,I cannot say enough wonderful things about this company and the location i worked at. being surrounded by so many beautiful things and the discount was phenomenal!
good,Productive and friendly work environment in which the company acknowledges associates for their high achievements in exceeding their personal goals on a consistent basis.
good,Very busy environment that will keep you working at all times. Neiman Marcus is a great and notable company to work for. The benefits are GREAT including the discount.
good,Good environment beautiful store. Good boss and co workers. Flexible hours lunch breaks. Generous discounts. Business could be slow at times sometimes hard to stay busy.
good,"Cleaning out pallets to create spaces to put up new merchandise. "
good,The atmosphere is at is cutthroat at time with the employees and with the gossip and other issues. The Managers are great and understanding. I loved the managers and thought they where great. Long Boring hours in one spot and not moving much in an area. Loved Customer Service because it was fast pace and easy to deal with customers. The Techonology needs to be updated seriously and need for easier use for employees to work with for better customer service.
good,Great Job in an up-scaled sales environment. The 30% discount is appreciated and much desired at NM. Draw vs Commission sales structure and be stressful at times.
good,"Was perfectly happy there.  Good atmosphere, competent management team and good co-workers.   Pay was excellent in the beginning but lowered company wide for cosmetics sales people."
good,"I was actively standing working, sales, clients services, facials"
good,"The pay was okay and the trainer and staff were very friendly. in all honesty, I would have still worked for Neiman Marcus but I needed more pay and more hours."
good,"I enjoy assisting my clients with their purchases. Great place to work, flexible schedule. Great management!  I learned a lot from my mentor and was able to share my knowledge."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company most of the time.  I really like the bonuses we were given at the end of each month, which was based on the amount of money collected."
good,Be ready to work with children and have a great sense of humor to make every day a beautiful day! Must enjoy outdoor activities along with educational curriculum support to students.
good,Great place to work with good customer service training. Also Management classes offered for advancement. Be nice to the customers as they pay a lot of money for the items sold.
good,Great environment without much micro management from higher ups. I enjoyed my co-workers and like the fact you had no cap on pay.  I liked cross-selling with customers.

good,"Very nice and clean environment with  good professionals on charge.   Being there, you can meet rich and famous around the world... Very international place where you can learn different words from other languages.  I speak three languages and even this way, I was always enriching my vocabulary. It is a place with a very fast pace and you go with the flow."
good,Employees are very seasoned there. Hard to move up only because people are there for years and never leave their position. They love it there. There is also no real dress code or uniform which is a plus.
good,"Nice place to work, nice people, 111 Customers way, Irving,Tx Supervisor was nice to be around the people were ready to work and everthing that want a long woth it."
good,"Work is calm quiet stay focused on my task."
good,Work from home so I didn't have people breathing down my neck everyday in my face. Team Managers are great depending who you get. Learn the job yourself because sometime the helpful you get from supervisors or leads can be contradicting.
good,A very good job to work at looking at new product coming in every day and it also gave you the feeling it was Christmas every day when you were  unwrapping new and beautiful items every Day.
good,"Fantastic company to work with, benefits are great. "
good,10 years of experience as a Senior Consultant and Business Analyst in Retail domain; hands-on contributor and SME on Retail Ecommerce and Point of Sale implementations.
good,"I honestly love my job and enjoy the people that I work with. I the end of the day there will always be Ups and down in any job or any company, you really have to adjust yourself and always try to be very professional dealing with these kind of situations.  Great management, every day there is something to learn, co workers are nice for the most part."
good,Team and family oriented atmosphere.  Plenty of room for  advancement.  Nice management team.  Loved working closely with customers and assisting them with all of their customer service needs or concerns.

good,"Neiman Marcus is great for people who love and adore fashion/latest trends. Mostly, the company is commission based so it's a dog-eat-dog world here. I thankfully am in customer service and I enjoy it. Every once in a while customers are upset but it's apart of the job and usually executives don't mind helping diffuse the situations.

Most of the companies have 37.5 to 40hours and in a slow season everyone should get cut to help the business The part time employees get under 15 hours a week and we get pay bi - weekly. For some employees this is the only job and it is difficult. "

good,"I didn't work here long. I started a department with out any assistance from upper management. I would email and attempt phone conversations. Which never happened. I had felines due each week that needed to be signed off by upper management. They would always put it off or tell me if it could wait until Monday. When I'd ask for help I wouldn't get a clear answer or was never contacted back. Everything you do is wrong. They hired many people because they were desperate to fill positions. They did not obviously do a thourough background check m, because several of the explainers were caught shoplifting.

good,My work day would start taking calls from customers with complaints or just merely placing orders. I learned that there is always a way to calm down an irate customer if you listen to what the customer needs. The hardest part of my job is when it takes too long to contact the supervisor. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer is sastisfied.

Trained collectors on the proper methods to follow FDCPA guidelines as well as company rules and regulations. I learned how to work well with others and understand the strengths and areas of improvements for the collection department. The management team was great and very much a part of the success of the Quality Assurance team that I was a part of. My co-workers were a great team with a great leader that allowed us growth and knowledge offered by the company. We worked great together and understood the needs of the business and focused on what could better the department. The most difficult part of the job was listening to all the collectors calls. They could at times take multiple reviews to insure a proper analysis. I enjoyed training the department in a classroom setting.

Itâ€™s important sharing ideas, concerns and achievements in order to succeed any company standards."
good,"The company focus is definitely on its online business. As brick and mortar stores show decreases in traffic, we should be finding ways to bring the customer back. Consistently offering promotions online gives the customer no incentive to want to shop in store. Since this is commission only, slow days can be stressful. The culture though is lovely, lots of contests, allowance for brand specialists, mgmt is supportive and product assortment is amazing."
good,I enjoyed working there. The environment is very quiet though so you have to be great at servicing customers on the phone. If you do not like to do that this is not the place for you. There is a lot of outsourcing to be done to gain new clientele. Unlimited possibilities when conducting events.

good,Neiman Marcus has employees that have been there for over 50 years.  It has a family vibe and a fun atmosphere.  A typical day at work for me is pretty busy.  I am usually juggling a few projects at a time.  It makes the day go by fast and keeps me busy.  The hardest part of my job is my management.  They have been working together for a long time and are not always open to doing things a different way.
good,Since it was an internship a typical day at Neiman Marcus included learning about Personal relations. Throughout my time at Neimans I got a chance to work in the stock rooms and work behind the scenes of a store fashion show put on to introduce Neiman's clients to new designers attanded by the company.
good,"My favorite part of this job was simply the employees. They were always there for you to help if you didn't quite understand something.

I had an opportunity to work in cosmetics, but I decided to try out a different department such as dresses, in order to learn a different aspect of the business. Basically, a typical day would be to greet clients and help them put together a wardrobe. So I would intersell throughout the whole store, and end in cosmetics in order to help them with their beauty needs."

good,"I loved working for Neiman Marcus. I could create my own way to manage customer requests. Having to work around poor management that did not understand the department needs or how the customers shopped the department taught me a lot about negotating to meet departmental needs. This management team only looked at the numbers but not what caused the numbers to change up or down by looking at customer requests and needs as far as operation of the store. i.e. how customers are contacted, how often, multiple customer requests and the ability to act quickly to meet them. This is the fashion industry and it moves fast - management and the company needs to do so also to meet those fast changing needs."

good,"There is no such thing as a typical day at work when you are dealing with the public. I learned how to merchandise better. In management you must be able to adapt to everyone's personality, this would probably be the hardest part of the job.

good,don't expect to be promoted. don't believe in young people but fun place to work and different everyday. truly a dream job but every person feels disposable and replaceable
good,It was a relaxing job with great benefits as a young individual yet the job culture is that of veterans who have been there for a while.

good,"I wouldn't recommend Sales but if you're able to find a place in the company where you're able to get guaranteed hours and pay, I would say it's a great place. The benefits were great and the yearly discount dates were amazing if you're into designer stuff. Company meetings and brand meetings were nice and fun. Great place to learn about fashion. But keep in mind, people are cliquey and gossip/rumors/trashtalk is a part of the job culture."

good,I love this company but feel stuck in my position. I have done well as a sales assistant but I need more of a challenge.
good,"Management as in most retail work environments is always run a little shady. They exploit some associates depending on favorism. Know your boundaries and learn the rules.

good,Highest level of retail but unfortunately online shopping has hurt everybody   I am ready to free lance and work part times and believe me I have a lot of customer knowledge and know how.
good,"While the work itself was interesting, the hours are not ideal as they change from week to week. Characteristic of any retail business, one is required to work Holidays, weekends, etc, which interferes with personal life balance."
good,I enjoyed my coworkers and management. I do think the pay plan should be revised based on the decline in customers throughout the years. They do have great benefits
good,Great job worked here for some time . Didn't want to leave but life got hard after a accident with an 18 wheeler and they wouldn't work with my therapy

The hardest part of the job was fellow employees getting too competitive...:) but things always seemed to work out."
good,"Worked with Management in all departments and was the main contact for Neiman's Customer Service nationwide. Neiman's has a very good reputation for treating their employees fairly.  After seven years with the company I was layed off on September 30th, I hold no bad feelings as I enjoyed working with the management, co-workers and I really liked my job. I would recommend Neiman's to anyone looking for a job."
good,I learned about working in a Department Store.  The company has a great history and provides the ultimate in customer service.

I enjoyed working here when I first started but I think it is time for me to move on."

good,enjoyed working with co-workers and satisfied my clients and meeting my quota.
good,"Neiman Marcus is the top of the retail chain. That position is earned by extremely high standards of service and expertise. Even working in the shipping and receiving areas, we were expected to know the vendors, know how to handle the materials in the merchandise, know which sales associates were experts in which designers, and become familiar with who their major clients were and their preferences. The merchandise is beautiful and wonderful to work with. Work/life balance is considered secondary to meeting the customer's needs. Employees must be willing to devote extra time during holidays and evenings in order to follow that priority."
good,Working for Neiman Marcus has been a great experience. Handling customer inquiries and resolving billing issues was a typical day at work. Reconciling accounts and processing payments was done on a daily basis. Processing customer returns was also required.
good,"One of my best jobs experiences so far, working as a sales associate at Neiman Marcus provided me with an elegant environment to work in and a whole new experience in the retail industry.It was a very sophisticated job environment with trunk shows, special events, pre-sales events,Cocktail parties to cater the needs of our very selective clientele. Even though it was a demanding and challenging job to do at times, the reward for assisting clients to the best of my ability was very satisfying."
good,"Meet and exceed customer goals, sales goals and presale goals. Book monthly events. You make it happen with no micro management. The workplace culture is click-ish but focus on your work and treat others respectfully and you will do well. The clients are amazing and really appreciate the superb customer service."
good,"Nice place to work, I enjoyed the employees. And I also enjoyed the benefits and overtime that we worked. I donâ€™t like how they didnâ€™t tell me I was seasonal worker."
good,Manager gives multiple chances to work on special projects outside of the regular job duties. This does not go unnoticed when up for the challenge. The department works really well together to complete daily duties.
good,"You have to fix a bunch of different things in the building from registers, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, compounding and painting.  You have to be well rounded to work at Neiman Marcus."
good,"very nice and clean atmosphere, customer service always the best, giving  the first class service."
good,Neiman Marcus is great company to work at to learn the impact of client communication. neiman Marcus caters itself effortlessly to its customers which I really enjoyed. It was all about great service and truly listening to the wants of what your customers wanted. The staff as welll was always amazing and very helpful.
good,"Neimans is the best retailer of luxury and it is reflected in the way they take time in working with each customer to ensure clients are treated well  "
good,Overall a pretty good company to work for. Not too physical like most warehouses. Monday through Friday dayshift only. Occasionally weekend work. Great benefits. Possible room for advancement. Downfall for some is not knowing what your shift will be. The latest is until 5. Sometimes there is lack of hours where you get sent home around 12-1pm.
good,Enjoyed working for a company that knows its mission and has great customer service. Provide employees with a good work environment and support to grow their business and move up within the organization.

good,The store provided a variety of upscale merchandise and very professional management.  I enjoyed the camaraderie between management and employees.  The environment was professional but light-hearted and enjoyable.

good,I love my job. I love my managers. I love selling clothes and assisting customers with purchases. I love my dicount. I love working in receiving and prepping inventory..
good,"For the most part I feel very well taken care of at Neiman Marcus. They care about their employees, offer a competitive wage, and good benefits. The only down side is that there is not a lot of room for growth. I sometimes feel like my talents are underused."
good,"Neiman Marcus is an excellent organization to be part of.  I had a great experience and loved my time there.  I am thankful for the experience, the knowledge I gained and the friendships and associations I made."
good,"I have been employed with Neiman Marcus for almost 9 years. In that time I have progressed from sales associate to Human Resources Manager.

good,It's a great experience. I learn something new everyday and the managers I've had are all very helpful and forthcoming. I enjoy working with the customers and the team environment that we have and how everyone works together to better the company.
good,"They train you and then let you go. Minimum supervision. My training was all web based but I think they have changed it. They have teams with leads, every team is different. The hardest part of the job is being strapped to the computer. Get a standing desk it will help."
good,"Maintaining sales goals, reporting to both department manager and vendor.  Offering stellar customer service.  Building loyal client base.  Makeup artistry, stock control."
good,Neiman Marcus is a great company to work for. I had really bad hours but other than that its was beautiful. The pay was great and we got raises on the regular. It was nice working for this company.

Those who go above and beyond are recognized each month. All associates are offered 401 K, medical/dental, LTD, and paid time off. The environment is clean, air conditioned, and professional. The facility closes at 6 PM so all associates can still have a life."
good,"This company does everything ""by the book"", For a retail store it feels very ""corporate"".The sales are there.  Knew a sales associate that sold so much he had a personal assistant. Great training, great opportunity for advancement. I def recommend this place."
good,"As a Sales Associates  I provided outstanding customer service through product knowledge, floor merchandising, new merchandise arrival and sales event participation. I was provided with goals and resources to establish and grow the Neiman Marcus business.

I was in search of possible dishonest employee, fraud transactions by dishonest shoppers or shoplifters. In between camera work I was responsible for store operational paper work which consists of loans that needed to be scanned out and bag checks, purchase checks of employees. Before the day is over I would usually do awareness meetings with employees in my assigned departments on L/P Alerts and operational compliance based on my audit results."
good,"I truly do love working in this company. The people are wonderful, both co-workers and customers. "
good,"A typical day at work was fun but also different no day was ever the same. I learned that you treat internal associate the same because they are also a customer like your external customers. Management were helpful when need and had your back, I can't say there was anything hard about my job once you learned the processes of your job thing became like second nature, The most enjoyable part of the job was the team that I worked with and the relationship that I developed not only with them, but with external customer as well It was a fun place to work.."

good,I began my day with a morning huddle with the executive team to discuss the production goals and corporate focus events.  I touched base with all of the department managers to ensure coverage and to go over daily agenda.  I ensured that the CS office balanced and participated in our corporate call with the other 42 stores nationwide.  The most difficult part of the job was terminating employees and the most enjoyable was the close relationships I built during my time with company.
good,I enjoyed working for this employer.  The management and HR leaves something to be desired as they are inconsistent of enforcing employee guidelines which can be considered some favoritism.  Not a good look for such a highly regarded do company.
good,Excellent place to work. Great support staff. I enjoy interacting with customers. I have nothing else to add to this review....I have nothing to add..

good,Loss Prevention gets short changed. Not treated the way they should be treated after saving the company money on losses.
good,"I went to work for Neiman Marcus for one reason.  It is a very high-end retail business and I figured I could meet a business/bank owner or executive and get back into banking.  I actually made very good money.  You can make six figures working there as a sales representative.  I wasn't there long enough to do that but I was developing those kinds of clients that would get me there.  Neiman Marcus is a very well run retail establishment and i could have had a successful career with them but I wasn't interested in retail clothing. My plan worked as one day a person I once worked with at Victoria Bank and Trust came into the store. and, when he saw me, asked me, ""What in the world are you doing working here?""  I replied, ""I was waiting for someone like you to come in and help me get back to banking."""
good,I learned that being a team player all can conquer their goals. I enjoyed the work space and the employee appreciation week.

I have been in retail for a period of 10 plus years, but Neiman Marcus have definitely paved the way for my career, helping me understand not just more about customer service but opening the path for me with accounting. Neimans helped me understand where I wanted to go in life. Guiding me and giving me the proper teaching and training along with the tools to do my job."

good,The only thing that is a little bit not good about it is the compensation is too low for the job.
good,"A typical day would start with calling clients.  Restocking & rearranging the entire sales floor for new merchandise, even on Black Friday. The hardest part was the racks and racks of tried on clothes that had to be returned to sales floor continuously.  The most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of a customer with their purchase."
good,"Everyday same work. I learn how to be responsible."
good,"great coworks,easy job to learn,good management,the only thing i dont like about it is dont always get 40hrs every week"
