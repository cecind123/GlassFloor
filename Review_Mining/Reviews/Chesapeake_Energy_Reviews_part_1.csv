rating,review
bad,I worked this as a temp job and cannot rate this as I would a permanent job. I did some receptionist work and some HR work. The job varied and some buildings were very nice and some were very quiet.
bad,The new management does not care about their employees. They work you to death and do not pay you for it. There under staffed and going out of business soon.
bad,"Chesapeake Energy is a horrible place to work. The upper management is utterly clueless on what to do and how to go about doing it. Most of middle management is there because they suck up. I wouldn't recommend CHK to anyone for any reason, unless your family is starving.  If you do decide to work there, begin working on plan B immediately."
bad,Worked there for 5 year was good but know things really changed from bad ti worst  no advanced ments unless you know your production forman very well they hire firends and jump you and new hires become your boss after 6 months do not reccomend working here its bad
bad,Just wasn't the best fit for me at all. I wanted to try something outside of law enforcement field but this was a terrible fit. The agency as a whole appeared to be fantastic.
bad,CEO committed suicide in 2015. I'm not sure how much they conduct business now that the oil industry is collapsing in Oklahoma. Got into nursing shortly after leaving this company
bad,"Chesapeake was in the midst of some sort of ""growing pains"". "
bad,"Terrible place to work. They lied about what they were doing never affected my job but did lots of other people. Would say no more lay offs the rest of ten year then lay people off very next week."
bad,"Four of us were in charge of placing orders for truck loads of crude to be picked up at well location.  We worked 12 days on & 2 days off.  The pay was $10,000 less than other companies paid their employees for the same role.  There was no room for advancement in this role & upper management had no idea what we did, we ran & managed ourselves."
bad,Chesapeake tends to have layoffs yearly and it takes a toll on your psyche.  It is going through a transition and it never seems to end. If you enjoy rollercoaster rides then this ride maybe all you need.  P
bad,Very poor company with no regard for its employees. Extremely poor and unethical leadership. The organization leadership is extremely unethical. The former CEO was indicted by the Justice Department.
bad,poor mgt drove the company into the ground. too much micromanaging and too many cronies still on the payroll.  hopefully thing will start looking up in the near future.
bad,Job security was horrible! A month before they did a mass layoff the CEO told us not to worry about any layoffs that it wasn't going to happen. A month later they did a mass layoffs over 800 just on OKC campus & almost 5000 nation wide! This is the second time they have had such a huge/ mass layoff in less then 4 years.
bad,"Kitchens have mold in the fridge, some management don't know what they are doing and they are feeding people food that was not prepared properly. They base the pay on how they feel about you 3 years working there and i only made 10.75 an hr. I have a bachelor's degree and a degree in culinary arts"
bad,They are re- structuring and laying off like crazy. Most likely the job wont last long but they won;t tell you that.  They hire temps then get rid of you so they dont have to pay unemployment.  I would stay far away.
bad,"Don't Believe Fortune 500's Best Places To Work! It Must Be Rigged! As said other reviews Management and HR are weak to say the least! My Coordinator made Racial Slurs about Martin Luther King and about the only black person in our department, on MLK Day! So bad I wouldn't dare type them here! I took it to my Manager and he said he would talk to him. Shortly after my Coordinator was promoted to Supervisor! I asked my manger about this he said ""I talked to him and told him we need to be good supervisors"" I filed an Ethics Complaint which was suppose to remain anonymous, it went to HR and immediately all the management in my department began to treat me different, shunning me, talking behind my back, and refusing to even make eye contact with me. HR conducted an investigation, they called several of us in, said not to talk about it to anyone. Immediately I had co-workers coming to me asking me what I had done. After admitting I was the one who filed the complaint, most of them said they backed me up on all the complaints I filed. Yet to this day nothing has changed. I could go on and on with stories, reasons why I am here at Indeed.com. Run Do Not even consider working for these people!"
bad,I really don't have much to say about working here because I don't remember much about it. We are getting pretty far back into my past careers. I wish I could help more.
bad,"Would not listen to employees. HR thought they knew everything and would not even talk to us. They sold a lot of property that would have made them money, again, they would not listen."
bad,The foreman and the supervisors didn't like you based on your dedication to the job but on how much you kissed there butt.
bad,"If you have a family and Chesapeake is recruiting you run fast do not move to a very unsecure company that will let you go as fast as they make their next bad management decision!!!!  And then you will be stuck in Oklahoma, Yahhhh!!!!!!"
bad,"There are some professionals here, but it is mostly rednecks, boots and F-150s. They believe their own propaganda in that it's a great company to work for--maybe if you work at HQ in Oklahoma. Field offices are poorly managed with little direction. Be careful if you want a career---this company is now under investigation for price fixing land leases in Michigan; the board of directors has recently been mostly replaced, the CEO is under SEC investigation. Can you say Enron?"
bad,This poor management in the South Texas Land department has been a known issue for years but HR and VPs will do nothing to address the problems.  Staff employees receive zero recognition for their efforts and accomplishments.
bad,Chesapeake treats it's contractors like dirt.
bad,"*No opportunity for advancement "
bad,"This company is the most unprofessional, unethical, discriminatory, and bigoted place I have ever worked. I have over 30 years work experience and 20 of those years in oil & gas industry. I’ve never dealt with so many lies and breeches of confidentiality.  I was one of many that doesn’t “fit” in and were. let go because the company being so unethical. To the point that HR was even a part of it. There so many cowards who were more worried about losing a job than doing the right thing and in turn compromising their integrity and breaking employer/employee confidentiality."
bad,"Management at the San Antonio business unit was terrible. Processes were not handled with tact or consistency. Focus is taken from the earnings of the business units and given to fund the corporate campus. Several culture trainings have been attempted recently, and none have stuck. A very un-transparent company culture, from top to bottom. No sense of team work, it's very much each section and team for themselves. Little credit is given to those who work in business units."
bad,"Lack of career advancement is a major obstacle in Chesapeake's success.  Current managers were promoted based on appearance or tenure, not necessarily talent, at a time of immense growth.  Now that the business is shrinking rapidly, many of those managers are unable to cope with the changing demands placed on them and those in their service."
bad,"They work you until you have nothing else to give. While I enjoyed my co-workers, management was awful. No matter how hard you work, they always expect more."
bad,"-job required constant travel, and although I was able to make it home most nights (having started a new family this was very important) was usually required to drive anywhere between 1,000-2,500 miles PER WEEK."
bad,Stressful place to work with frequent rotations in areas with no expertise. Too much focus emphasized on workplace culture and not on the actual work.
bad,"Was the poster child of innovation and great results.  No longer.  Earnings releases has them cutting for the sake of staying alive and all the good talent with plan ""b's"" have departed."
bad,"Chesapeake is trying to be a big player in the oil and gas industry.  Unfortunately, their own internal rules and bad business decisions from all upper management prevent the company from being great."
bad,"Chesapeake was a great place to work. With different management it could still be a great place to work. The new culture is strange and constantly changing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job itself, the work was great. The worst part of the job was constantly wondering if you were going to have a job."
bad,"Company is very unstable with a downward spiral since 2013, led by sub-par  middle management. Benefits are excellent in attempt to keep employees happy."
bad,I really enjoyed being a natural gas scheduler at Chesapeake and working with my fellow coworkers.  I learned a lot about how important communication is with upstream and downstream partners.  Management was not strong in my department and very little job security.
bad,"The pay and benefits are great.  Working for a company that does not care about work/life balance not so great.  I have heard that other departments do not have this issue, but the midsream accounting group does. The department had a very high turnover rate which perpetuated a culture of misinformation and confusion."
bad,"I was raised that if you don't have anything nice to say, to say nothing at all. That being said, I only worked in the field, not at the corporate office. I'm sure rules are different."
bad,Poor management - they either don't care or ignore the problems.
bad,"Just another day in the oilfield great place to work, I would recommend it to someone that is looking for a job"
bad,No life outside of work you will work 70 plus hrs a week . You will only have 1 day a week off and don't plan on holidays off chances are you will work
bad,"My department was rough, lack of leadership and understanding of the work that was being done. Culture was based on if you were liked in my department. I tried to fit but I was not a woman and my boss had a complex towards men."
bad,"Chesapeake Energy is a place that grew too fast for its own good. Employees were promoted based on seniority and not merit. Middle management is littered with untalented hacks. The executive level is full of brilliant industry minds, but for the life of them they can't figure out how to put the right people in a position to succeed. Chesapeake will continue to flounder for years and years; the mistakes of the past have caused irreparable harm."
bad,"toxic environment. Does not allow for freedom to grow and horrible upper management. Money is great, but its not worth it."
bad,"I didn't find my time here of any particular value. My perspective is one as a temporary employee who was never hired on because I didn't fit the mold. I am appreciative of the job that I had and that it was able to provide me with a necessary paycheck. However, I never felt as if I had a voice within the job."
bad,"Management did not truly care for their employees. While the company is in the red, they continually focused on the culture of the company instead of actually looking at processes that could be improved or phased out completely."
bad,The culture has changed to bitter sweet.  You spend much of your time competing with colleagues rather that working with them.
bad,I did not care to be a CPA and the life that that entailed.  CPA firms work you so long.  I felt as though I was selling my life for a little bit of cash.  It made me realize that money is not happiness and what is everyone trying to buy.
good,Not only was it a stressful environment but they also preferred quantity over quality of your work. Me personally I would rather do the task right the first time instead if going back to change errors. The manager told me that I shouldn't worry because he runs a report once a month that lets him know where the errors were made. Which there were more mistakes made by people because of management. I personally would never work there again because they have no structure and the majority of employees don't even know what their doing half the time. Just a bad environment to work in.
good,"- My day consisted of monitoring the previous days work load and assessing the current days work requirements for my project.  My projects were long but extensive. "
good,"I was sucked in to this job with promises of an excellent work/ life balance and growth opportunities. This was quickly crushed when I was stuck at a desk and forced to work 12-14 hour days, 6 days a week even when there was no need and not much work to be done. My boss was verbally abusive, swore at me and liked to use racial slurs. Fortunately he retired, but the current management is just as bad. Needless to say I'm looking for an exit and a path to grow my career."
good,At the time Chesapeake was a great stepping stone in my growth as a professional and as a person - how to identify organizational politics and manage yourself in a highly political environment and still maintain a sense of self-worth...truth.
good,"Although some benefits are topnotch, its is not a company for a long term career as there are few opportunities to advance unless you have a masters degree in geology.  Management is unpredictable, and it is routine to be told one thing then have the opposite conspire.  The slogan is people are the best asset, yet routinely good people are left feeling unappreciated and leave, which only concentrates the bad work culture."
good,"The work atmosphere is stressful, mangers didn't do their job. workers were over worked all the time and weren't treated fairly. Managers played favorites as well. i was afraid to come to work every day."
good,"I liked working at Chesapeake. I would have retired from Chesapeake had they not laid me off. Overall a decent company. Great benefits, great people, good work environment."
good,Interesting place to work. Opportunity to learn various things regarding the oil and gas industry.
good,I was a contractor for a few months.  I worked right before the layoffs happened in 2015.  Management did not want to help me learn.  I went in for a totally different job and was placed in a different dept.
good,"It's a pretty cool and a quick pace job to do, it is not a very difficult job, if you just stay on up of the orders. I thing I love about it is that is not that much moving."
good,If you don't fit in with the culture of CHK then you won't last long.  You won't last long anyways if the Board of directors allows the debt to become insurmountable again.
good,This is a six month contract position. This contract will expire at the end of this month or at the expense of my supervisor.
good,Chesapeake is an employer that requires innovation in order to grow the business.  Accounting tasks are meant to provide purpose and help with the development of the overall business.
good,Indeed requires review only reason I’m writing review. Many changes have happened since I first started with Chesapeake. Currently there are many issues with upper-management.
good,"Layoffs are pervasive in this industry and especially at this company. The technical staff is mostly young and needs better mentorship. We had many different responsibilities without being forced to do one specific job, which was one of the best aspects of the job."
good,"The company has too much debt for current cash flows.  As a result, management has created an environment that does not promote a healthy career.  "
good,There are great people and teams to work at within Chesapeake. I had the unfortunate chance to be in a department that reorganized and changed leadership every 6 months. This makes it difficult to achieve department goals because the team changed direction with every new leader. And every new Anadarko leader was more clueless than the last one. This wouldn't be a problem if leadership trusted those of us that were the individual contributors that had been at the company longer then they were. There is a rampant problem with Chesapeake leadership wrestling with itself to their own detriment.
good,Great place to work but compensation is not good. It had a great atmosphere to work in with the people I was around. they do not look at contractors in  a goo light.
good,"long hours, no home life, but it paid well and the drivers where good people"
good,"Managed calendars for multiple sr. staff members"
good,I would assess every job site.  I learned things pertaining to the oilfield.  Management is efficient.  Co-workers are good to work with.  The hardest thing for me was being in an office every morning.  The thing I enjoyed the most is keeping everyone safe.
good,"Chesapeake has great benefits, but broken processes and no accountability. Management works 20 hours a week and does homework all day in her office while everyone else has to pick up the slack. There are no standard operating procedures in place and chaos ensues."
good,"Work day consisted of doing Data Entry, verifying new employees work for misspelling. If you did a good job with hardly any errors then you would be able to listen to headphones while working, which made the day go by faster. Also we were allowed 15 min breaks in the morning/afternoon."
good,"The benefits are amazing! However, the HR team was dysfunctional. There was little communication and collaboration. It felt like Highschool with a bunch of cliques. The employees were all the same personality wise and culturally."
good,"Chesapeake could be a great place but they continue to downsize on average every 2 years. Also, one person has to do the job of 2 or 3 people. You are continually worried about layoffs."
good,"I was hired on as a remote field support tech (IT). started as a contractor. Was SUPPOSED to go perm after 9 months. 8 months in, Chesapeake had a ""restructuring"" and laid off over 400 employees from all over the country; including ALL the remote field support technicians. I'm not sure how they are maintaining all the IT work, but the corporate office stated that ""the helpdesk in Oklahoma can handle it""...yeah, ok. (I'm not bitter or anything :) )"
good,I loved my job for the most part!  Never a dull moment.  Going to the field office for quarterly reviews was fun & I got to meet co-workers that I would talk on the phone with.
good,Days were typically slow but lots of training opportunities to expand knowledge either operationally or technologically.  Benefits were great with an on-site gym.
good,I really liked working at Chesapeake while the company was doing well but has been going down-hill for years.  When they started laying people off I decided it was time to leave
good,"Learned a lot about oil and natural gas production.  Advancement was difficult and no matter your work ethic or ability to take initiative, you will not be noticed for your hard work."
good,"Six drill rigs working around the clock & calendar . Two completions jobs going on at all times . More traffic than anyone can imagine . More landowner complaints , citizen issues than any company could ever deal with ,  what fun !"
good,"processed invoices on a daily basis. expect to spend time viewing pages of documents and many emails to team members for verification and questions. information can be overwhelming at first, but company provides training through 1 on 1 mentoring. though management is lacking and work is self-motivated, you can get better feedback through result of your work. the turnover rate is high and most positions are temp contracts."
good,"The culture at CHK is all that I have known in the professional world.  It was incredibly fun and focused on keeping people happy. Training on the other hand was much less emphasized upon and ultimately my skills were seen as ""no longer adequate"" for the position and I was let go with no option of training to bring my skills to where they needed to be."
good,"Put everything in writing."
good,"As with any company there are problems in certain departments.  I believe the CEO is sincere, but there are areas that have issues."
good,"Good company, nice work environment, required a strong work ethic and tough minded employees."
good,"It is a beautiful campus, but previous management has lead to a situation where the company is doing great, but the Debt to Income ratio drives most decisions by the board."
good,Fast paced working environment. Typical day spent modeling.  I earned about air emission filtration. Hardest part of the job was staying within schedule to meet project deadlines.
good,"It is hard to review the company in its current state, it has changed dramatically since I was there.  In my time, it was a decent company to work for.  A little stressful with disagreements between upper and middle management."
good,Entered land/ title documents into system which had to be closely paid attention to detail as well as in a timely fashion.
good,"The management in the field is horrible. Safety glitches from inexperienced managers looking to advance their agenda. A buddy based system. Great employees that care, not the same from the top managers."
good,The company is in a big state of tradition/restructuring.  Waiting to see the end result.  When the restructuring is over the company won't be anything like what it was.
good,"I loved working here. However, when my daughter started having seizures and required multiple hospitalizations they were not willing to work with me.  But the benefits were amazing."
good,"So much has changed since I started Chesapeake in 2008, not the same company it once was.  I was laid off in November 2019 after being there almost 12 years."
good,"I was interviewed from a friend’a mother. My job was to refill ice buckets, refill fountain drinks, and to prepare snacks that were on the menu  I worked during Basketball games"
good,"Evaluated Latin America Basins for new ventures for Chesapeake for unconventional plays."
good,"While the company benefits were good the leadership was lacking.  Guidance for a new hire is very much needed.  Report to one manager, yet the work preform is for another."
good,"Great people to work with. However, staff strength and executive direction were not on par with what was needed to transform and grow their business' supply chain."
good,My first two years at Chesapeake we’re great then management changed and everything changed to the worst drastically. I was laid off but was also ready to leave
good,The job was stressful at times and felt as you were addressing the same problems day after day.  It is a job for a person who is highly motivated and has a drive to do the best they can.
good,I work as a third party for the company. The job here lasted 4 years. The job consisted of lateral lines and pipeline. The gas company had  a lot of meter station as well.
good,"I liked working at Chesapeake Energy Corporation; I especially enjoyed the people I worked with.  In the most recent layoff, they cut a lot of creative and outspoken people."
good,"Good business to work for as long as you can conform to what the EC wants you to be. Free thinking and dissenting opinions are not received well. Overall, good place to work if you are a yes man."
good,"Pay for Performance Culture is fair to all employees.  If you work hard, are productive, and prove your ability, you will be acknowledged and paid well."
good,"I actually enjoy working at CHK but there is no advancement for me in the current position unless I move to OKC which I don't want to do.  I've asked for more training or even if I pay for my own training, can I do more and the answer is always no, that we have people in OKC that do that."
good,"Bad upper management. Do not keep there word. Good production facility's and they do not  mind sending money when it is needed........"
good,work 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off. great pay work day hitch work night hitch. Over all another step into the direction to advance my career
good,"Daily routine got boring. Did learn more about pumping jacks and heater treaters. Too many Chiefs not enough Indians. Plant operator was great ,my relief operators were not knowledgeable enough. Hardest part would be keeping repairs( all units decided to fail). And you had problem free days."
good,"Basically I feel it's time for a career change and new challenge. After 35 yrs in this industry, you will continue to learn and gain experience in situations that you may encounter This in turn prepares you to handle any problems which may arise."
good,I Enjoyed working for Chesapeake Energy. It was one of my favorite jobs. my coworkers were friendly and supportive. The hardest part of the job was being laid off.
good,"The pay and benefits for Chesapeake were great. However, I was scared at times to even take a break for lunch for fear there would be consequences. The executives ask their employees to be transparent, ethical, and develop strong communication skills, but most employees felt theirs was lacking. I did enjoy my last role at Chesapeake and my boss was much more enjoyable to work for than my first. However, due to the low price of oil and gas I was laid-off. The managers had zero say in who was and was not laid-off. I am not sure how a CEO and the other executives know what the daily tasks of each employee are in order to make their decision. I felt it was not handled well."
good,The company lost a lot of experience with the 2013 volunteer separation program and layoffs. Some departments wisely selected employees that were under performing for the lay off while others used some unknown criteria which left them with inexperienced personnel facing complex issues.
good,Great company offering opportunity for advancement.  Desire permanent placement.
good,"I liked working at Chesapeake, but would agree that their management shows favoritism."
good,Chesapeake used to be a great place to work. It was very unique and had character. It is now just another plain corporation with no heart.
good,Large E&P Company based in Oklahoma City that was branching out to the Midstream Sector.  
good,Working at Chesapeake was a good experience. I worked with nice people and had good managers the entire time I was there. There was uncertainty in the air alot of the time with the recent events at the company. They have great benefits even today and the campus is beautiful.
good,I have lost Thousands and thousands of dollars in my 401 K and its stock is a joke . If I knew now back when I first started I would have never bought CHK stock and invested in their 401 K.
good,"Typical day at work was reading through various probate court, deed and title transfer documents to determine ownership of mineral rights for specific counties of interest."
good,good job to work at and good people to work with saftey is to the highest youwill get all the skills to work for the company and everyone that you work with
good,"Due to a high debt load, long-term employment is questionable. Assets are constantly sold to meet operational needs and to pay down debt, resulting in layoffs every couple of years. Benefits are great though."
good,"I hope they pull back from the debt. It was fine, and the people who work there are wonderful people. I hope it gets better for that company someday.."
good,No advancement but very good benefits. The company is trying to renew their workplace culture. I enjoyed working in the field. I found office was disorganized.and did not have a plan on how to get the best from employees. Always changing. Not consistent.
good,I left early on during the change over in management so I cannot accurately give a review of how the corporate culture or work environment is at CHK currently.
good,"Professional company with good environmental and safety practices"
good,"Over the last year I have learned that promotions will never come and my job is completely stagnant. Management plays favorites and takes vacations with employees. Common talk is about sexual harassment and alcohol abuse, very profane, and crude. "
good,"A tough and yet fun place to work. Management needs to run business smoother as every corner that could be cut was being cut, along with salaries. Any other company in the same field will end up paying you the going rate, this company has cut all costs and hires entry level persons and moves them up the line fast (if you are dedicated)."
good,"The company was the one of the best to work for when I started over 2 years ago. Employees were valued and it was shown through all the amenities like the fitness center, restaurants etc. All of that is still there but the atmosphere has changed tremendously. While I was there before the restructuring began I loved going to work and seeing my co workers etc....when the new management came in the atmosphere totally changed. You never knew if you had a job or not the next day because they would never tell you anything. The morale of all employees was so low and no one wanted to work. Unfortunately I was let go after weeks and months of stress and worry. I am currently looking for a job and see job postings from them which I don't get. Over 600 people were laid off and your posting jobs???? Doesn't make any sense to me. If you are looking for a job especially in the oil and gas industry I would stay away, at least until the restructuring has ended."
good,"nice, convenient restaurant, individual offices for privacy. It is very fast paced and you are held accountable for your own work so must have self discipline and time management skills.  overall fun place to work"
good,"Fun job during the earlier years.  Later no matter how long you had been there, you were just another employee.  No one cares how much you have given the company in the end."
good,"Good company previously employee oriented now more concerned with board and stockholders. Great people within the company. multiple changes. offer a good benefits package, pay not consistent with other organizations of same type and career path."
good,"Grew to fast. Lack of coherence. Not enough qualified mentors, too many talented young people with not enough guidance. Re-invent the wheel mentality and lack of cross functional groups. Silo builders."
good,Great place to work with great benefits and great people. I enjoyed my time there and would recommend this company
good,Well it has been a good place to work and it offers a lot of great benifits as well as career growth.
good,"Busy on computer all day updating spread sheets, graphs, etc; but with flexible start times, lunches, etc. Availability to learn different types of programs that the company uses, to your benefit. Culture of people is very diversified.  Hardest part is learning on your own and not enough training or the training isn't given to everyone who needs it.  Most enjoyable is being able to go out and play sports, work out, swim or just take a stroll around the field track on the work grounds."
good,"I was an intern with Chesapeake a few years ago. The work environment was nice. You can do onsite yoga during your lunch break. Managers were great too. During this time, they had 150 interns and only hired 1 for full time work, so that is why I would be weary of the company. Layoffs happen."
good,"Pays very well, but is active in layoffs.  Gives employees great benefits, if you can stay employed with them long enough to enjoy them. Learned a lot about how not to treat employees."
good,New things to learn everyday which I enjoy. Operate various machines and equipment. 14 days on and 14 days off. Very hands on type of work Nd safety is always main priority
good,"I liked the company as a whole based on their ethics, benefits, and the upper management. However, I felt like they wanted me to change who i was as a person even when I did my job well and gave higher productivity than what they expected. Also, I am a people person, so sitting at a desk 9 hours a day staring at a computer all alone was not my cup of tea. I needed the face to face interaction with my customers."
good,"Great place to work, but not enough work to go around.  Corporate red tape and silos still hamper company's ability to be efficient."
good,"A fun and diverse environment.  Ample opportunity to attend training classes in various subjects.  Campus Facilities make activities more convenient and can include your family."
good,no leadership.  managment was weak.  CHK has made stenps to improve but the quality employees leave.  everyone does their job not many understand the big picture.
good,Management was awful.  Co-workers were excellent.  No opportunity for growth.
good,"index land, oil and warranty deeds into data base system with two breaks per day, little time to talk to co-workers or socialize. Managment was good and helpful when needed."
good,"They have a beautiful work environment at the main campus in Oklahoma City, with plenty of convenient on-site parking, a huge fitness center,  company restaurants and a Starbucks counter.  They also provide a lot of learning opportunities on campus, on a wide range of topics through company led training sessions, or guest speakers. Plus, a wonderful benefits package, and lots of PTO."
good,"Great campus and restaurants, but management was constantly breathing down your neck. Always talks of layoffs and when they occur, the wrong people get let go."
good,Learned a lot about the Oil and Gas industry. You hit the ground running and are expected to work long and hard. Real good benefit structure.
good,was a pretty good experience. i like the experience very much. pretty good pay. i would do it again if given the the chance. its a must to budget the pay though.
good,"Loved working here. Was laid off with around 800 other employees. Great working environment with strong leadership. No warning when laid off, would return if possible"
good,"Sometimes monotonous, worked with very capable people. Management seemed to know what they were doing. Possibilities for advancement were not always available"
good,I worked for a great boss who allowed me to do my job and let my performance speak for itself. The workplace atmosphere and campus are excellent. The ideals are very positive and they helped me learn about myself through workshops and seminars.
good,"Chesapeake was great at one point until management changed. Layoffs were based on who you knew and not performance. Management turned a blind eye to integrity to protect their ""Fringe Benefits"""
good,"I would definitely recommend Chesapeake as a place to work. It does get difficult not knowing if you will be laid off or when you may get laid off with the constant rising and falling of oil and gas prices. Overall, it is a great place to work."
good,Working here taught me a lot determination and energy conservation. I also learn how to use power tools and a bobcat tractor. i was always tired but felt good using my body
good,This was a great job until the downturn of the industry and there was a layoff.  Working in a field office was a different experience than the headquarters.
good,"Chesapeake is a great employer!  They take very good care of their employees by providing a nice work environment, great facilities (gym, restaurants on campus), excellent salary and benefits.  Constantly learning new processes and more efficient ways of handling work."
good,i really enjoyed working for chesapeake enegery. the people were really good people and the work was enjoyable. the daily work was challenging and fufilling.

good,"Awesome place to work and there is always lots to do and learn. Great co-workers to learn from and bounce ideas off of. "
good,"We,re usually up at 5am take a look at our equip. get it lit off an running, on location we pretty well know our duties, safety is of the up most importance, what we do is very dangerous, we move oil an gas drilling rigs, there,s not much room for error, i operate a 950H CAT loader with a set of 9' forks, this tractor weighs in at approx. 53k pounds and will lift half its weight, its quite a balancing act. This is the only tractor in a 3 piece rig moving team, the other two are trucks. On a normal day there are usually 6 pieces of equip. on location moving around at random, you constantly have to be aware of your surroundings, not to mention 25-30 workers, there,s no stop an go lights  you have to know what you,re doing, running over something or someone is not an option. My coworkers an management team are good people they,ve  been trained and have experience, we all work pretty well together,  probably the hardest part of this job is staying focused, an dealing with the stress, it can be stressful at times, you,ve got be conscience of the consequences you have people on the ground around you at all times, the wrong move an something  could be damaged or worse someone could be hurt or killed, its a demanding job you stay on top of it or do something else, its not for everyone. I supposed the most enjoyable part of this is the people,its a team effort, it takes all of us to do what we do I usually feel a great amount of achievement and satisfaction at the end of the day but as well as i enjoy what i,m doing my background is electrical, mechanical, instruments, management and"
good,Very good environment to work in with lots of friendly caring people.
good,"I absolutely loved my 5 plus years working at Chesapeake Energy!  Great working environment, supervisors challenging you from every angle, great benefits, 401K, stocks, bonuses, fitness center, the works!  They really take care of their employees!  Such a blessing to work at CHK!!"
good,A typical day would consist of analyzing leases and researching CHK's interest in various wells.
good,"The people at Chesapeake are great to work for. They take the time to get to know each employee on a personal level, which makes for a better work environment."
good,"A great place to work. Lots of benefits to working on the corporate campus, including child care, fitness gym, world-class restaurants, and intramural team sports for employees only."
good,This company provided bottled water and healthy snacks for all employees along with a fitness center on site. Great company that allows you to advance from within.
good,"Process Improvement | Project Management | Logistics | Operations Management | Turnarounds"
good,"Overall great place to work with good leadership.  Unfortunately, the financials have always been a struggle.  The company will have to shrink before it can grow again."
good,Chesapeake used to be the place to work for and as oil prices went down Chesapeake went down even faster. The culture changed rapidly and they have layoffs almost every year.
good,Very competitive work environment. Long hours and 7 days a week Multiple projects to oversee. Contractors were lacking a little experience with station work. .
good,"I loved my job but management made it almost impossible to succeed.  We were micromanaged by a management team that had less experience than most of the field hands. The top down political aspect of the company was dysfunctional to put it lightly.   "
good,"They pay very well, but after 19 years the company is going through very tough financial times so I was layed off as the entire company down sized.  We went from 12000 employees to under 3000."
good,It was a good company but if you’re a lease operator you only get one weekend off a month. They have very good benefits. I would definitely recommend working for them.
good,Great opportunity's if company can reestablish its direction and begin to exploit its core areas of operation. Great people with good support from Corporate.
good,"Hard work, but you get to be outside in nature. the only problem with that is you will have to be in the snow and heat of summer."
good,"Culture is good, young employees, management flustered, opportunities to change the company for the better abound! CHK is dealing with many past and future decisions."
good,"Place is shut down, but I learned how to DJ and Emcee for crowds."
good,"2 weeks on 1 week off rotational schedule, Hydraulic Fracturing...Good management...Awesome life long friendships...hardest part was being away from family 2/3rds of the year...loved working with other professional hard working people."
good,"They have a condensed schedule, so Fridays ended at noon which was great.  The environment was awesome, culture is all its own."
good,Provides all the resources you need to perform essential job duties
good,It was a really good place to work I was there for 6 years the management was always willing to help me and understood when I had to take time off the benefits were definitely really good as well
good,Productive and good place to work except the management because they don't know how too treat there hard working employees. It could be a long lasting career place
good,"Good job Great benefits "
good,The company has great benefits and seems to be headed in the right direction.  They have done a great job working on the overall corporate culture and have grown from that initiative.
good,"Start my day at 5:30am and ends when I stop receiving calls. Learned how to manage LOE, and personnel, critical thinking and working with engineering teams on optimization of Artificial Lift Techniques.  Hardest part of the job was letting an employee go and helping employees through personal loss. Achieving and surpassing goals set forth by Corporate."
good,"Each day consisted of working with various data to put together monthly reports and financial pages. Learned a lot of excel and data analysis, as well as how to conduct myself in a more professional manner necessary in such a large corporate environment. The culture was work hard so you can play hard. The hardest part of the job were constant deadlines. The most enjoyable part were all the extra perks."
good,Chesapeake had a lot to offer.  Once oil and gas comes back up in prices I'm sure they will be better off.  My day at work consisted of 12 hours at a desk watching drilling.  Coworkers were very talkative and helpful same with management.
good,"enjoyed my job..  stayed busy which I love.. started as entering invoices, reviewing invoices, was able to change positions to handle all check and ACH runs and handle other check issues. everything was great before we split to Seventy Seven Energy"
good,Work was always a set schedule which was nice for the restaurant industry. Very positive atmosphere with approachable management. Provided with top of the line equipment & ingredients.
good,Chesapeake Energy is a good place to work. Nice people. Excellent benefits. My manager were great and knew what they were doing. Had some stress at month end close.
good,Excellent company although they are financially stressed due to long term debt obligations that a prior CEO left the company.  Has long term potential if they can get out of debt
good,Chesapeake is an amazing company to work for.  You cant work with better people. You work with the most talented people and you get to work with current technology.
good,"The internship at Chesapeake is set up very well. It is meant to challenge you and push you outside your comfort zone. You have a ton of helpful people all around you, that are willing to help answer questions. But they make sure to let you make the project your own. The summer could get stressful towards the end with your big presentation coming up, but it is worth the stress for a potential job offer."
good,"some micro management, favoritism, learned different technical skills, training in different areas of the payroll department. the hardest part was dealing fellow colleagues jealousy with department"
good,Good but subject to layoffs. Large campus and facilities. Hard to get to know other departments. Great lunchrooms and workout facility.
good,Great place to work gained a lot of experience in high level negotiations and worked on large scale projects.  Enjoyed my time there and would do it again.
good,"Nice, young vibrant work staff! Even though the company is a very large producer of gas, they still offer a ""small town"" culture at the company.  People are encouraged often to mingle with people outside of their normal social circles.  They also give away hundreds of free tickets to employees for the Oklahoma City Thunder Basketball games"
good,"Chesapeake was a fantastic place to work with the exception of the decline in the oil industry which provided uncertainty and a stressful work environment."
good,I choose not to disclose my work experience overall with Chesapeake. I will say that it is a sound company with a great future moving forward in the Oil and Gas industry.
good,"Good company with great benefits, generous paid time off."
good,They are a good company over all...But the uper managemant dose not care about training you to move up.
good,Great learning in environment. Hard working company. The benefits are great but they work you very hard.
good,You basically get paid to watch a game and concerts depending on the job. Free food if you work near the kitchen. Coworkers are friendly but the management has been sketchy since one of them left.
good,Fast pace work environment that focuses on diversity of thought.  The company is focused on establishing a healthy culture and realizes that its employees are its number one asset.
good,Mostly good company that allowed on the job learning and encouraged employees to keep learning new skills.  Poor management of funds and drop in stock prices began having a negative impact on the company as a whole.
good,The work environment was enjoyable due the the quality of my coworkers and the upkeep of the facilities.  Multiple layoffs led to the lack of trust in management to make the best decisions.
good,It is a great company that was built with employees in mind. They have had a rough past but the experience working there is still very great with exposure to decision making and overall operations.
good,Each position has a wide range of duties and tasks. Experience in many areas is gained quickly while management is willing to share knowledge and field ideas.
good,It was a great place to work. Although I started working there when the company started to do cut backs and did not get to enjoy all the perks. I was a contractor there.
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits. Lots of great people work for the company. I got laid off or I would continued to work for the company. I learned all facets of IT.
good,The best part about Chesapeake are their employees.  Management has gone through a lot of growing pains and I don't believe they look out for their good people the way that they should.
good,"I have a higher degree than most people around me, but the opportunity to move up and utilize it are lacking. The commodity environment does not spur growth and it has therefore become difficult to advance."
good,"Wish I still work there, have lots of good people working there. Good safe place to work, strong team, lots of work, can not say enough good things about the team I work with!!!"
good,"check location for spills, gauged tanks, read meters and figured oil and gas production for each day. also figured water production and took care of water desposile"
good,Great group of people to work with. Willing to train. When you did a good job people noticed. Safety was always top priority. Loyal to there employees.
good,Upper management respected the decision of the field supervisors and allowed each business unit to make decision that would maximize productivity.
good,"Great place to grow and learn. Always busy and lots of projects, data to work on and with. Young crowd so a lot of self drive and learning but good training available."
good,"I enjoy working at Chesapeake.  The people are nice, there are opportunities for advancement, the work is interesting."
good,"I learned that things can change at the blink of an eye.  One day you have a job, the next day you don't.  The work is interesting and challenging.  I loved being a part of the Chesapeake Team and hope to find another job that welcomes me with my knowledge of the oil/gas industry & HR knowledge."
good,Chesapeake is a great company. They help you achieve your personal and professional goals.
good,A typical day included scanning hundreds of oil and gas leases into the company system. I learned many different aspects of the oil and gas industry. Working with many different types of people of all ages was a very enjoyable experience. The hardest part was being laid off due to restructuring of the company.
good,Chesapeake is a great place to work and learn about the oil industry. Their benefits are exceptional and the management team is very strong. They have a great culture and take extreme pride in all of their endeavors.
good,"Was a great place to work, people were wonderful.  "
good,"Culture among the colleagues was very friendly and easy to work with.                                                                                              "
good,Great place to work. I like the diversity and culture of this company. I was impressed with the Training program and team meetings which contributed to my growth and success.
good,"This company needed to work on being more diverse. They hired majority the typical blonde female regardless of education and experience. "
good,Good place to work until they started to sell off properties and no where to transfer out to. In the last 3-4 yrs the management has changed so that has brought about lots of changes. Some perks that we had no longer exist which sometimes makes you feel less appreciated. I enjoyed working for the company years ago on a much smaller scale & the values the original owners started out as. For the first 17 years Chk was a family oriented company but that soon changed.
good,"Management awarded bonuses bases on leasehold and targeted production no consideration of costs.  Although pay was well, hours were endless, often thrown under the bus, pretend that everything is okay while those in the know think differently."
good,I have enjoyed many successes during my time with Chesapeake Energy.  The benefits and compensation were unmatched by any of my previous employers.  Chesapeake continues to evolve by successfully adjusting to low commodity prices.
good,"Fast paced environment looking for dedicated, hard working employees.  Competitive salary and benefits and they encourage work/life balance.  PTO is easily taken/used and family time is understood as a priority.  half day Friday is nice!"
good,"Enjoyed working at this company,  Great benefits. Great place to work,  Management was good. Convenient location.  Decent hours"
good,"good place to start a career. has lot of potential for an employee to succeed in becoming better at various things related to crude oil processing, managing and loading techniques."
good,"Cross-functional teams, with highly skilled peers, driven to perform. We push each other to make the right decisions for the company; Product, Process & People. Chesapeake is relentless in their pursuit to find better ways and try new ideas."
good,Due to the debt obligation that will plaugue the company for the next 5/10 years they are not growing they are shrinking. This means there are limited opportunities to advance. Not impossible but they are very limited.
good,"I performed repairs on gas wells recorded production values, gauged waste water production tanks. Team meeting Every morning. Monthly meeting over safety, work performance, etc.."
good,Enjoyed working for Chesapeake for over 3 years. Would still be with them if they had not sold off in my area. Pay was competitive with other company's in the area. Unfortunately the price of oil dropped and they sold off. When the company sold off they treated me well and I was given a severance package.
good,"Daily: Cross-functional teams, with highly skilled peers, driven to perform. We push each other to make the right decisions for the company; Product, Process & People."
good,"Will miss the people.  Company was a good company to work for however, job security was always in question because the company was always looking to sell off assets to pay down their debt."
good,"Great benefits, pay and facilities for their employees. Great work life balance with restaurants and gym apart of their facilities. Job security at high risk being in the oil industry a lot of layoffs."
good,Chesapeake set me up with a rewarding work day learning about various production techniques. I had inspiring management and the culture was positively friendly. The most difficult part of the job was the long work days due to my schedule consisting of a 12 day hour.
good,The days can be long and rotating shifts/on call can be tough. The pay is great and the people are good to work with most times. The long hours can make even the friendliest of people seem a little grumpy at times.
good,"Was able to learn as much as I wanted for further advancement."
good,everything was good with this company really not complaints. they just sold so many times i got tires of sticking around and waiting on what was going to happen next.
good,This company was excellent to work for and the benefits were outstanding.  Created close friends from this environment and the benefits were paid for.
good,"A great company to work for.  Always busy.  A great work environment.  How to work with a variety of different types of people in a different type of environment.  The management was good."
good,"Worked as a member of the team that oversaw a company-wide upgrade to MS Office, then as a member of the Help Desk. I really enjoyed my time with Chesapeake and with the people I worked with, and probably would have stayed on if it had not been contract work."
good,If you like being in an office doing your work by yourself this is the perfect place to work! They are also willing to work with your schedule.
good,Working as a contractor for Chesapeake was a great experience. The management was very knowledgeable and helpful. As a third party contractor it was clear that there was an appreciation for the work we were all doing.
good,Good communication with operations teams.  I indirectly reported to 8 VP's and it was difficult if not impossible to meet all of their needs.
good,"As a Drilling Consultant for Chesapeake in the Rockies business division, I found the operations extremely challenging and engaging. The Drilling Engineers and their drilling programs were thorough and efficient. The Engineers, and Drilling Manager were team players and were always open to new ideas and suggestions which allows forward momentum in our operational procedures and efficiency. I was personally able to be a part of multiple ""firsts"" while working with Chesapeake in the Rockies; First ever ""drill with casing"" in the Rockies, first to drill the curve and lateral in one bit run, first to drill through the Steele formation with WBM and set casing shoe at the end of the curve, implemented the first DWOP program for CHK in the Rockies, performed the first 24 hour rig move program, etc. - A testament of Chesapeake's relentless pursuit to find better ways and try new ideas."
good,There were lots of applications to learn and we were given time to learn them. Company was enjoyable to work and so were some of the people.I loved my shift and I stayed busy.

good,"Checking and maintaining 65 well and equipment and sending reports."
good,"Great place to be! You will want to work here. Bring your lunch, while you are here. Bring your kids to work day was fun. Christmas party was good."
good,"Great benefits, bonuses and tuition and gym reimbursement. I enjoyed my time working there. I was laid off along with my coworkers. Very sad to leave Chesapeake."
good,"Electrical Supervisor, Not Operations Manager, played alot of Jekyl and hyde games. I left there with a letter of recomendation, as to where now I cant  even get the senior operations manager to communicate with me. Im sure the supervisor has tried to block any good marks I had with the company. I made myself completely disposable to the company, while the supervisor spent the majority of his time getting high on the premises not doing anything."
good,"Great corporate culture.  Atmosphere and facilities, restaurants are very nice.  Pretty good work/life balance, as long as you get your work done.  Management does a pretty good job keeping up with the pulse of its subordinates, especially being as large of a company as it is."
good,Chesapeake has a strong collaboration environment. Working as a team and building each other up. Doing what was best for the company was always the goal.
good,We started our day with morning meeting and discuss the issue about the wells with field operation team. Review the schedule for workover potentials and attend regular meeting with land team regarding the potential divesting. The most fun part is visiting with different team members
good,"Great opportunities to learn and apply to everyday functions within my department.  Great team to work together and combine skills to ensure constant productivity in the workplace.  Very safety aware and strictly follows all EHS policies.  Nothing hard about my position at Chesapeake at all, I was able to work at my own pace.  Supervisors and managers great encouragers and helpers."
good,Great place to get work experience but not any type of career advancement. Super easy to get lacks and just stay where you are a position due to compensation. Manager didn't really know what I did on a day-to-day basis however.
good,Balance work and home life is important. We work within both and if you can find piece with one you will not find peace with the other. Work smart not hard.
good,"Commercial-focused company that provides excellent employee benefits. Shareholders and employee interests are at the forefront."
good,"Company was established and quickly grew through the innovative leadership of founder.  Company invested significantly in employee benefits and work environment, as well as local community.  With the downturn in the industry and the exit of its founder, company has struggled to remain afloat.  But, the future appears bright.  "
good,Enjoyed every year of consulting I have done for Chesapeake. The company has been very good to me. They are very fair about making sure that you get the time off you need to go home and be with family.They were also very good about allowing you to just do your job without much micromanaging.
good,"Each employee has a definite set of responsibilities and goals for the month and is able to structure their daily tasks according to due date and priority level. Management is very trusting of employees to perform their work at the highest level without the need for micromanaging, which allows us to work independently and relieve unnecessary pressure.  My current team has a great atmosphere for training, asking questions, collaborating to complete projects and automating processes in order to meet department goals.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with; we get along really well, and have good relationships outside of the office which helps us remain positive and excited about work every day. The Management team does a very good job of trying to identify any areas of improvement and act on them quickly."
good,"Chesapeake promoted a proactive and positive workplace environment. The management team was very skilled, professional and always willing to assist/teach. Team work was highly emphasized, and the comradery in the field office was outstanding."
good,"I was only a temp, not a bad place to work, great co-workers, always had something to do"
good,"Good company overall, only bad part is they start you a day or two into the pay period so you miss out on 18+ hours of overtime. Lease operator 2 was the job I had"
good,Human Resources administrative support for oilfield service companies.  The hardest and yet the most enjoyable part of the job was the fast paced environment.
good,It was a great job untel new management came in and a lot of people quite and the rest were fired. Loved the job but the political side took a bad toll  on lots of good employees.
good,"I learned a lot, there was a lot expected and demanded but felt good work was recognized in most groups. it was a great experience during my time there."
good,Pay is good and you get plenty of hours. I personally loved my job at Chesapeake unfortunately i had to relocate. You are basically on your own all day so you can make you own daily schedule to an extent.
good,From day one I felt welcomed to the team. During my time working there I gained valuable experience with oil & gas taxation and tax basis. The management is proactive in helping you find training opportunities.
good,"Fun, fast-paced place to work with tons of responsibility that keeps employees both satisfied and involved with everyday operations"
good,"Ability for accurate site surveying, leveling and use of total station"
good,"My job duties remain unchanged, the company that I was working for (Chesapeake Energy) was just bought out by another company which is now Chevron. I am still a contract worker but I do love my position there."
good,Well managed company with great values a safety oriented company with stop work authority for every employee to use when necessary. Awesome employee benefits and great pay.
good,"Great Company to work for (when I did my internship there in 2013). Great environment, food was great too and very inexpensive. I would highly recommend this company to whoever is looking."
good,"CHK was a great place to learn the fundamentals of a large E&P company. The dynamic work environment offered a lot of experience in exploring and developing geologic prospects. The fast pace of life while working in dynamic team (geologists, engineers, landmen, and regulatory personnel) opened my eyes to the complexity of running a successful business model. The most difficult task of this business was keeping the drill schedule full of new locations. Sometimes the direction would rapidly change and many months of work and planning were reset, making catching up seem to be an impossible task, requiring lots of extra hours in the office. The most enjoyable aspect to working for this company was the amenities and services offered, which made it easier to spend long hours on campus."
good,Worked very long hours did a lot of training and working with different service companies on the east coast. Miss the people most of all Met a lot of people from Ohio and enjoyed the time there.
good,Treat employees well. Great company to work for. Safety is number one. Great group of people. Would jump at the chance to work for them again. Hated the layoffs.
good,"My time at Chesapeake was fast-paced and extremely educational. I was part of a group that managed several events at once. We worked hard, put in several long days and grew as individuals and as a team."
good,Enjoyed many years of employment at Chesapeake.  Fast-paced job; work was very satisfying as well.  I had a host of responsibilities that continued to increase over the years spent there.  There were opportunities for growth and the company rewarded hard work with great pay and benefits.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Family type atmosphere. Great place to work. Enjoyed my time there and would go back in a heart beat.
good,"Really enjoyed working the fellow employees here we all worked together and helped one another and we all learned alot, they gave us the opportunity to learn more on Natural Gas Production, Computers, and Simenars."
good,"Great place to work, good benefits. Secure campus environment beautiful and covered parking with a fitness center and running track. Very family oriented."
good,This is a wonderful company to work for and it has great benefits.  The management and coworkers are great and it's an enjoyable place to work.
good,"I strongly believe that in addition to my EH&S experience and knowledge, Chesapeake supported the systems to maintain a safe and healthy work place,"
good,"Was a great place to work. Had good equipment. Great benefits. Home daily, awsome pay. Comany sold crude oil division. What a disappointment. After relocation over 1200 miles."
good,"Job was physically demanding, but there is plenty of opportunity for on-the-job training, it is a large company so you have the opportunity to geographically locate.   Turnover was a bit high so it was hard to bond with your crew.  Overall it was a positive environment."
good,"I have worked in environments that provide consistent work and proved I have the ability to handle several different assignments at once. Management trusted me to handle confidential documents and provide quality work within a timely manner. The most enjoyable parts of the job are the company atmosphere and co-workers. There are no hard or impossible tasks, just new challenges and a developed skill and gift to think outside the box."
good,"It was truly an honor to work for a Fortune 100 company that cared about their employees growth and development. "
good,The environment at Chesapeake made it a great place to work. My department felt like family and that allowed us to accomplish a great deal by relying on each other for many tasks.
good,The co-workers were very nice.  I learned more about the oil and gas industry and how it works out there.
good,A good place to work for.  Excellent benefits and employee perks.
good,Chesapeake Energy/Performance Technologies is the first employer I've had since leaving the military and I have been impressed. Great company with great benefits.
good,Worked part time.
good,"large company, management qualifications are below average, great learning experience, great benifits"
good,I working in the shop with good people never had a dull day.  But the management team takes thing way to serious and also makes promises that they know can’t be kept wich turns into endless amounts of overtime
good,I show up to work at 6 am every morning if I had a route and went threw all my wells and on the computer then ran to all my wells gaging and checking them for leaks then did my books at the end of the day and fixed any problems with wells before I went home .
good,Great place to work when the energy industry is going well. The culture is what I was looking for. Overall it was the best work experience of my life.
good,"Built successfully more than dozen financial models for different industry specific needs and responsible for Project appraisals, Financial modeling (projection and valuation models), Financial statement planning, KPI reporting, Financial consolidations, Due diligence of projects, Feasibility studies, Competitor analysis, Study of risks associated with projects and tendering.

good,"A typical day at work is a 8 to 12 hour work day. No day is the same from the previous. I am required to use the company vehicle and maintain the service on the vehicle as well. Logging in the hours for work, the miles the driven, and any money that was used for the job."
good,High paced work management very busy multi tasking no time to meet with worker not in tuned with the working crew and does not talk with working crews only delegates to supervisors you don't have the opportunity to talk to management only thru a second party so your concerns get lost in translation .
good,"very fun and fast pace to work. very professional and safety focused organization. they are very focused on employee safety and take care of them very well. only down fall that would go with this company is, that with it being very demanding and fast paced you lose alot of home time with the family. other than that they are awesome to work for."
good,"Too bad there's so much debt. Chesapeake let me go after a little more than 5 months with them. It was the best place that I've ever worked at. My coworkers where all very intelligent, friendly, kind, and genuinely cared for each other. I was let go because I was a duplicate job and they were streamlining so that they could pay down their debt. If I had the chance to work there again, I would in a heartbeat."
good,"Chesapeake energy was a great company to work for. It afforded me the ability to travel, learn a  new skillset and build long lasting friendships in the oil and gas industry."

good,I loved my time at CHK. Each day was filled with a new challenge and I looked forward to meeting those head on. I made some life long friends in the process.
good,While under the original management it was a great place to work and learn.  It had all the amenities and yes you were expected to work hard but you were rewarded appropriately and you learned.  You were recognized for your work and accomplishments.
good,Worked for Chesapeake Energy as Conpletion/workover consultant for 13 years in that position. Became a major player in the oil and gas industry.  Chesapeake management would allow the consultant to have freedom of working any vendor on lists and  completion procedures  were very prompt.
good,"The job at hand was always busy, never a dull moment. I managed cost, coordinated job task, introduced safety leadership to my teammates. I also learned to accept constructive criticism with a more knowlegdable aspect. I learned that as I was working with others and as I passed on my experienced, I also learned from them. The most enjoyable part of my job was achieving respect from a new team of co-workers. I don't think I have a hard part because I thrive on any task to achieve its full potential, just my opinion though."
good,"Highest 401K match in the industry (15%); 4-7 weeks vacation depending on your age and overall work history, not just with CHK; good medical benefits with an on-campus clinic, company restaurants on campus, good atmosphere and workplace culture overall.

good,You get to work with great people and they make an investment in continuing your training and investing in technology. The half day Fridays are a great perk.

The work out facility and sporting areas are open to everyone and possess great quality.

Employee satisfaction is a high area of focus for top management."

good,Chesapeake has a wonderful campus and is a great place to work. It is dynamic and you are given as much responsibility as you would like to have.

Management is great, supervisors are always on top of everything and if you need anything they are there to get you what you need.

The majority of management was very professional, and they worked hard to create a congenial workplace with great people from diverse backgrounds who were all experts in their field. These people were, for the most part, the very best part of the CHK experience. The hardest part for me was creating my own job with little direction, but I managed to not only create and constantly add to my duties, but to excel at them. I learned that you don't wait on anyone to tell you what to do or how to do it, but to jump in and figure it out, and to never be afraid to ask questions."

My position was completely removed from the company and my department was removed from the company and out-sourced.  I enjoyed everyone I worked with including the management staff and worked very hard during the years and saw major advancement in my career.

While there I dealt with city officials as well as regulatory agencies when needed, as well as helped develop the NORM program.

Monday-Friday work week, and always options for overtime.  If we wanted an ingredient for something special we would get it if it was reasonable.  There were 5 restaurant concepts, and the best daycare I've ever seen.  We also got stock 2 times a year, annual bonus, followed by a Christmas Bonus.  People who worked there were happy.  We were encouraged to reach out to the community, and actually were paid 4 hours per yr to do so.  Most of us spent more time on our own.  I was allowed the freedom to create my own menu daily, salads, sandwiches and desserts.  I did not get managed.  We had wine tastings every month with the vinyard owners from Napa.  Those were great, but they were long days.  I came in at 4:30 a.m. and would get home around 11:30 p.m. on a Thursday, but it was only once a month."

The benefits they provide are incredible; Along with the vibrant culture of the campus, Both of these factors make Chesapeake a company that people want to work for. "
good,"A typical 12 hour shift would consist of us calling and following up with emergency callers from previous nights to make sure their needs had been met, printing and shipping ID badges to different buildings and offices across the states. We were constantly receiving calls, and camera alarms so the shifts went by pretty quickly. The hardest part of the job was definitely trying to juggle all the requirements of an emergency call, only to have another one come in. Sometimes the situations got in a crunch, but the structure that was in place made it easy for the team to cover for one another."
