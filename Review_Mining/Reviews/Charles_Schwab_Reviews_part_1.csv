rating,review
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
bad,"The majority of the employees do not have children and work 60+ hours a week and expect everyone else to as well. "
bad,"Permormed CCAR and ERM related contract work. The risk head is a waste running the dept with people like ERM head who behaves everyday like she has just been let of a mental institution. While I was there 7 people quit and the big guy couldn’t care because his bonus doesn’t get affected. Jokers running the place. If Chuck or his daughter care they can reach out to me."
bad,Poor management. No communication. No advancement. Management shows favoritism towards the people who have been there the longest but they don't work as hard.
bad,"Not a good Place to Work.  I saw several good PM's Leave before I did."
bad,"A terrible culture and work place.  I would not recommend working for this company.  After Charles Schwab retired the place was no longer a place to work.  The place is much more a sweat shop, they do not believe in promoting people in their current position.  You are required to apply for a different position at a higher level, promotes no motivation to do a good job as you will not be rewarded for doing a great job.  Many people currently working at Schwab tend to simply stay under the radar by doing as little work as possible, some choose to actually sleep on the job. Top management is never held responsible, ridiculous employee surveys only hold immediate supervisors responsible for unhappy employees, and these managers have no power to make any real change or impact."
bad,Terrible place to work... Stay away... High stress... Bad experience.... Not nice people... Pretentious... Unrealistic expectations... People fake their way forward... All about the external image and not the substance... Interview wasn't even for the job skills I was interviewing for...
bad,Schwab is a negative environment where employees are micro managed. Raises are terrible if at all. I do not recommend them as any kind of long term place to work. They hire outsiders rather than promote from within.
bad,"My experience was perhaps the worst experience I have ever had in a job at this company. I would not recommend it to no one. Low pay, low morale, no respect for employees."
bad,Overall it was a stressful environment. It felt like working under a dictatorship. Lots of chefs and not enough indians. The micro managing was out of control.
bad,"The company has no development plan for its employees.  It has good life work balance, but it a company that provides just a 9-5 job.  There is no advancement plan or reward for hard work.  Moreover the company is unethical.  Specifically they required the software teams to wrongfully float Mutual Funds managed by Schwab up the recommendation chain, even though they clearly underperformed Mutual funds from competitors such as Fidelity.  It is a sales culture and technically minded people are treated with disdain."
bad,This company went out of business years ago in Florida. It was a decent company to work for but the pay sucked and it was not a good company for someone who is looking for a career.
bad,Untrusting work environment. Lack of control over success. Unidentified strategy.
bad,"This division of Schwab handled all aspects of the leased or owned real estate for the firm. They are poorly organized with little written policies and only annual interaction with upper management. We were required to used 23 different systems/products to pay bills, manage properties, order supplies and process invoices. This led to vendors not wanting to work with the firm because they didn't get paid for 3-5 months. Company credit cards were often ""turned off"" for non-payment which left me traveling and no way to get back home unless I paid for airfare via my personal credit card. They should start over and outsource the entire department or hire folks from the commercial real estate industry that can turn this ship around."
bad,"Discriminatory work environment, especially if you are a minority trying to progress in your career. Even though promotions are given, responsibilities are taken away."
bad,"Do not take a job as a ""Broker Trainee"" it is a call center and nothing more than a customer service job. They promise a start to a career that never materializes. Everyone is looking for the next opportunity to ""get off the phones"" and end up taking jobs outside of their area of interest or desired career path in order to stop taking calls. If you want to enter the world of financial services and do not have experience, take the job, get licensed and get out as soon as you can afterwards."
bad,"Inbound client and potential customer calls. Place trades, solve issues."
bad,"You are a clog in their machine. "
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
bad,Revolving doors. Have not met too many people who were excited to have been working there. Standard benefits but no job satisfaction. College campus like atmosphere.
bad,No innovation and collaboration isnt’t true. Tons of meetings and little decision making. Very much wants to avoid risk when evaluating new tools and software
bad,"Worked there, left there. Good project work, but management mentor-ship and training was less than desirable. Did not support critical thinking or dissent."
bad,"During my 15 interviews it was sold to me that someone with my skill set was needed. I was told that  help was needed to develop the team, enhance processes, make my own assessments of the team, and train the team.  They made it sound like change was needed and supported."
bad,"I worked for Charles Schwab as an Estate Representative, in Phoenix AZ management is disrespectful to its team members, They , micromanage to a fault. No matter what phone call you are on they want to tell you exactly what to say as if you do not have a brain."
bad,"My assignment with Charles Schwab was with Adecco contract."
bad,"Google ""Enlighten"" - basically a program designed to micro-manage every minute of your day. It boils down to numbers/metrics being scrutinized daily on white boards for your entire team to view. "
bad,"Schwab used to be a good company, recently they have been making a lot of changes and they appear not to be the best. There have been a lot of layoffs (2 in the last year). They cut travel down to $0, which seems to be a big warning sign. Stock prices keep falling. The pay is not good at all, the matching 401k is good though. There seems to be little room to move up in the company as well, after 3 "
bad,"Great environment with good people"
bad,Company is extremely top heavy. Very poorly managed and does not reward performance.The company speaks highly about vision and values but does not care to much for employees. Highly political environment and advancement is very hard to come by unless you are best friends with people in management  positions. A lot of husband and wife's work there in different departments and self promote the other. Would not recommend working there unless you where hired at a VP level  or higher.
bad,"Above 40?  Run screaming!"
bad,"I don't recommend working there"
bad,"I was promised to work with as an options specialist or on the bond desk but was instead put on a regular customer line. It is extremely regimented, allowing only certain amount of minutes to be off the phone. I was managing a small portfolio before this, handling a large variety of securities. I was led to believe that I would be handling serious securities with other portfolio managers and institutional clients, instead I was dealing with clients IRA distributions and people betting on the next penny stock to supply their retirement dreams."
bad,"You should very much avoid contracting at Charles Schwab. The culture is very ""stiff"" and everybody is on edge or is trying to cover their butt more so than ensuring value is being created. Wasn't my favorite gig by a long shot."
bad,"They hired every available Project Manager in the DFW area, then did not extend any of the three month contracts.  Not a good place to work, they play games!"
bad,Average place to work and poor compensation.  Commute is way to far from Denver.  No dress code.  A culture of zero accountability and mediocrity.  The good thing is that they care about client.
bad,"Nice people, seriously...but being nice won't make you successful.  Schwab's very tenured employees need to listen to the new people they have hired that have other industry experience, a fresh education, new ideas, and great information that can help the company surpass their competitors.  I was only met with constant resistance, pushback, angry responses, and simply 'no'.  Too bad, it could be a great place.  If you would all just open your minds a little.  Promise it won't hurt."
bad,"No one really knows what's happening or whats going to happen in any of the companies under the CS&Co umbrella. They havent figure out Agile, Federation of Tools, Data security or architecture, or that everyone should be using  the same project management style on the same  project. This compnay has more VPs and directors then employees. They are so behind in technology its laughable."
bad,Management there was extremely poor. There was very little instruction on how to do the job. There was very little room for advancement.
bad,"I worked in IT in the south Denver location. i really hated the job, everyone worked remote since they outsource most jobs to India, but they made me commute to a mostly empty office since I was a contractor. The management was clueless and some of the other employees were rude and insulting, but my manager didn't care. I thought it would be a great company to work for but I was disgusted to learn how much off-shoring of American jobs they do, I quit and closed my account quickly."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
bad,"It became apparent in the first month that nobody at Schwab is expecting greatness. To my horror I discovered that simply showing up was more than enough to continue collecting a check. Though I began a contract with the best of intentions I eventually realized that management and most staff have no real commitment to improving day to day operations or developing skills as a team. Daily technical system outages are normal in development and nobody is interested in finding out why. Development tools are often major versions behind what is current for a given platform. The place is bleeding money from every orifice yet everyone seems to be okay with it."
bad,"Cut throat environment - not the same company that hired me. They speak about teamwork in the branches but that is not true, you are competing against your co-workers."
bad,"If you are the type to be more interested in being on the social committee as opposed to working this is the place for you.  Most of us could never figure out how those people became managers, much less Directors."
bad,"Don't Fail the Series 7 or they will give you a 30 day notice faster than your head will spin. Some managers definitely care about helping you grow as a professional and a few just act like it. They claim to care about you as an employee, but with the ""one Schwab"" culture they are breeding clones. The don't care about you as an employee even though they claim to. They care more about the client which is understandable, but always remember you are a warm body filling a seat and can be replaced."
bad,"To work at a company for a decade and then be moved out was the situation. I always trusted companies, NO more!   Watch out for this one, seems good from commercials, but their products are sub par and they have no integrity."
bad,"Experienced program leader with extensive organization skills, managing high-touch internal and external stakeholders with consistent ability to work under pressure and tight deadlines. Solutioned complex regulatory and compliance programs, while providing technical and business domain knowledge to proactively identify risks across project lifecycle."
bad,Toxic UX practice. Management creates an extremely hostile work environment. Lead by fear from the top down. Promises to convert to permanent employment are rescinded for perspectives on projects that are not aligned with management. Contractors are treated very poorly by management.
bad,I was in the accounting department maybe that was why it was so quiet and no one tried to get to know each other. Not very friendly people and managers were not very helpful. Long days but pay was good and benefits.
bad,Schwab Corp was once a great local company and unfortunately is no longer the company it once was.
bad,Limited growth potential in Austin. Peers/co workers are the best in the industry. Management is difficult at best. Work there and get your licenses then plan to take your career somewhere else.
bad,no comment not a good place to work management not good no work life balance thought it was a good opportunity but that was just a façade once you get in there it becomes apparent it was a fake
bad,"The branding of Schwab is amazing over platforms like Bloomberg and all other platforms but the company is really not that diverse sadly. This would be something that would have Carnegie rolling over in his grave. He was about excellence and self improvement to those that wanted to succeed. Here at Schwab you have to ""look the part"" or ""fit in"" to the demographic stereotype of success... What a sad day.. I will strongly advise any foreign nationals looking to invest their money to avoid dealing with this firm.."
bad,"I found that management there will always ask for more.  If you are putting in 60 hours a week and ranked #1, they will ask for 80 hours a week.  The biggest tip, look at what those in their role have given up to be there.  I have found that many of them in mid management on up have sacrificed their family, have no family, or not married.  The good thing about working here is its like training in the Himalayas.  Once you go anywhere else life is so much easier. Also if you are in sales.  Prepare for a 5-10% pay cut every year as they ""re-evaluate"" the pay structure and give excuses.  So far its the only way Schwab can achieve their growth goal of 10% per year."
bad,"Honestly this job had potential, but for micromanagement, insufficient training, ""key initiatives,"" sweatshop ""Call center"" mentality...not to mention all the rude, demanding clients you had to suck it up for 8 hours a day...Doesn't pay all the money in the world either..."
bad,"Not a Place to work for those that want to advance. The required you maybe required to train your own bosses. if you want to advance in your career, look elsewhere"
bad,"Depending on where you hire in you will find stark differences in the Culture  & Management Style.  If you are accustom to ""LEAN"" Leadership this is not the place for you!  If you are content with the ""Carrot & Stick"" micro managment this is your place!  "
bad,"The DB department cannot keep a manager, and no one seems to get that the Supervising Manager is the reason, or covers for him."
bad,The main issues I had with Charles Schwab was the lack of career advancement and that it was clear by the vision of upper management that the banking side of the business was not a priority when it came to further developing the services or capabilities of the department.
bad,"The upper management is utterly clueless and disengaged. One director literally ""leads"" by coming in and burying her self in her office all day, then offers an appearance once a quarter to reply to the suggestions she ignore earlier."
bad,Pay is below average.  Management is challenged.  They literally reward you with toys like you're a child instead of money or stock options.  Schwab is your typical megacorporation.
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
bad,Not a place for an employee who is looking to grow. The job is very robotic.  The days seem to never end as the work is not satisfying and management is one that promotes a culture of passing the buck instead of accepting responsibility.
bad,When a new VP is assigned to a department they harass everyone to bring in new fresh out of college employees.  I think it all depends upon group you get hired in.
bad,Pay is great Terrible management. The client is number 1. There is always somebody. looking over my shoulder.Too many low level managers
bad,"Not a very good investment bank to work for . Weak leadership and not open to different opinions, too much office politics . Lack of relocation opportunities, lack of training and clear guidance to help you achieve efficiency , do not care about clients"
bad,Managers are micromanaging everybody and set up unreachable goals. Training provided is so poor and everybody expects employees to be ready 100% to perform work related tasks from day 1.
bad,if you need to get a license and get some experience it is fine. From there move on. Your branch manager is told what to do by people above. the upper level manager have no idea what goes on day to day. stockholder equity seems to be the driver of the company at this point.
bad,"The call center job is only for those that care only about money and not their families or any kind of life outside of Schwab.  They chew through people.  They promise on upward mobility, but that is not true.  The hours are terrible."
bad,"Schwab used to be a great place to work at, but recently the culture changed to more of a ""old-boys club"" where the management only cares about themselves.  "
bad,"Not conducive to sr. level - mid level employees;  entry level and Director and above, are supported.  Very competitive, employees are made to elbow way to top, in order to receive bonus, or move ahead."
bad,"Schwab has a very , Very conservative culture. Anyone who thinks outside the box or has any type of imagination should steer clear of this company. This company is very slow to grow and very slow to change. There is a absurd obsession with obtaining the Series 7 license, however 60% of the work in the company doesn't require any type of exposure to trading securities. Those who can not past the Series 7 test are treated like underlings or fired."
bad,"Poor leadership, unrealistic expectations, inferior technology."
bad,not what i expected.worked market hours. co-workers were awesome and management was not great.
bad,My experience here was not good. I didn't enjoy the work I was doing. Very little work/life balance. Working from home was frowned upon. Micromanagement and a lack of trust from leadership.  An almost cultish culture.
bad,"The salaried employees agressively verbally attack the contractors for hours. Company employees seem to not know what is expected of them, and they accept zero responsibility for their work. A colleague on a different team told me supervisors laugh about creating a hostile work environment for the contractors. Some actually yell at the contractors in private. Get pregnant? You're fired."
bad,"I loved the work I did and the contributions I made were appreciated. This position was extremely frustrating because I didn't feel the manager respected the position or the work I suggested. Oftentimes, a meeting I needed to use to gain decisions and present solutions was hijacked to discuss other issues. Sometimes a manager doesn't realize the work involved in completing a project."
bad,The constant prospect of being staffing reductions were extremely stressful which drove me to look for another more stable work opportunity.  No one should have to be under those circumstances.
bad,"There was a time when Schwab represented the cutting edge of technology and foresight in the brokerage industry.  Today is has grown into the corporate machine that represents the antithesis of what the Schwab culture was built upon.  There is no value placed on long time employees and they pay is not competitive.  There is no opportunity for growth.  I would not recommend Schwab as a long-term employer,"
bad,managers discourage friendships between coworkers. No one takes responsibility for their actions. No work life balance. Hours are outside of the normal for a call center
bad,Lost and not what it used to be. Profits are now generated off the back of the lowest paid frontline employees. Low pay for high amounts of work and responsibility. Very little care for development of employees.
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
bad,"Processed electronic documents "
bad,"Call center not a very friendly place, really high turn over rate under paid."
bad,"Never received clear instructions. Management does not have clear idea how tasks need to be completed, therefore I had to go back and redo my work several times. Do not treat you fairly. Stress level high."
bad,"• Develop Teradata reporting for upper management KPI metrics"
bad,"I must be in a bad group (team).  My experience is mostly negative.  Coming from a highly collaborative, dynamic environment to Charles Schwab has become a nightmare!  Their policy is to promote ""engagement"" but they discourage free discussions, unless they are ""approved"" and ""certified"" topics and positions."
bad,Must pass series 7 federal and state 63 exam to retain employment. In class training does not completely prepare you for exam. If you fail to pass exam on 3rd time or miss cut-off minimum you will be released.
bad,"The over all day consist of more work, less people and no communication between management and employees.  The management did not acknowledge associates that went above and beyond the call of their job, they just expected more from you."
bad,Senior Rep on my team in New Accounts operations reviewing documentation for correctness of information provided and compliance with industry regulations.
bad,"I am a current employee of Schwab.  The environment is extremely stressful.  There is little room for growth.  There is no room for individuality.  Management does not take responsibility for their mistakes and tends to blame their  direct reports.  No one stands up for what is right as they are afraid to ""rock the boat"".  Good benefits, hardly any diversity but ""Schwabbies"" are overall nice.  I am currently looking for another job to have a work-life balance, where I do not have to work 12-hour days."
bad,"Much respect to Mr. Charles Schwab for his vision for the company. The company has seen some good and bad times. My initial personal experience with the company was great!! Great training, Great management relations. People seem to care about your growth and the company's growth. People couldn't say enough positive things about the brand of Schwab.  You should check it out for yourself."
bad,"I came into the company as a contract worker, and was told I would be doing data entry, however I ended up unloading boxes, and sorting mail.  You are expected to do whatever they want you to do as a contract worker, and you are not given any benefits or bonuses as a permanent employee.  Do not work there as a contract or temporary employee, as you will not be treated well by management or staff."
bad,The company as whole needs to be more diverse. I am currently employed here and as mention the company could be more diverse.
bad,"There is no consistency in management. If you have a bad manager, you might as well quit now, because you'll have a hard time getting out of the position you are currently in. Schwab freely admits that their compensation is below the market. Their benefits are awesome, and that is about the best thing I can say about them. Promotions are pooled, so there may only be one or two available to a group of 50 employees or so. If you don't get the promotion, about the only pay increase they will give you is the 2% COLA."
bad,It operates on the basis of sycophancy. Those who grow within the call centers are the “eye service” officers that are willing to stab their colleagues in the back to be perceived as a champion.
bad,Pretty much was lied to during the interview process about what my job would consist of.  Some managers follow the rules while others do whatever they want.  Only way to advance is by going to a call center position or some type of management which consist of needing three different licenses.  The use of sick time for the company is truly unfair.
bad,They don't tell you that you will be consistently taking 60-80 calls a day for 10 hours over people wanting a check mailed out to them. It is a call center environment and should be treated as such going into the position they will never tell you that in the interview.
bad,"I worked at CS for a while. The management I worked for was terrible. It's one of those places that don't allow newcomers to bring ideas. It's so old fashion in regards to management style, and technology. I had the WORSE manager ever that was a condescending bully. If you want growth and something innovative don't go there.  Very old fashion and slow pace, there wasn't enough action for me. I forgot the most important thing, CS lacked diversity. Overall this company was very humdrum."
bad,A great company to work for. Management was not the best. Very unsupportive when it came to life/work balance. The pay was great the training was not good at all. It's a self learning environment. No one willing to help you learn your job or what is expected of you.
bad,"Charles Schwab's vision was all about the people, clients and employees alike. With the succession of Walt Bettinger, employees have taken a back seat to all else, no longer considered as individuals, instead as dollars filling seats."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
bad,"I do really enjoy all of my colleges, everyone on my team is nice and very helpful. The job is a low stress job for the most part. Constantly in alerts due to high call volume, and not enough staff. It seems they would rather pay overtime than hire extra people, which could be a good thing for some. The frequent manager changes can be a bit stressful.  It is hard never having anyone to advocate for you if you need help with a schedule change.  Overall considering it is a call center position I think the pay is okay , and the clients are for the most part very pleasant.  I do wish that every time you took on a new skill set or got added to a phone line you were compensated for it in some way."
bad,"Low pay, ridiculous raises, no career growth mostly lateral moves. Management has no backbone, they don't stand or help their staff."
bad,A good temporary place to work. Every minute of your day is timed. Training to proprietary software is inadequate. Most new hires dont even last six months because employee metrics don't meet their standards.
bad,"A massive organization with admittedly very talented developers whom are lead by some very ego-centric executive/director level managers and decision makers who play politics."
bad,"Don't let the Schwab logo fool you. Despite the reputation, this is a call-center that Schwab's upper management has all but forgotten. The lack of investment is so apparent that the faces of the wall clocks are yellowed from old age. Half the building is empty and most chairs feel like they were used since the 90s. The roof is also clearly delapidated, with dust and moldy smells blowing in during windy weather. It even creaks like a ship at sea! To top it off, only two restrooms exist in opposite ends of the building...and half of them are closed half the time for maintenance. You can imagine how much walking is involved whenever nature calls."
bad,It's a great company as a whole especially if you get into the right area.  But each LOB is so separate it's like working for lots of individual companies.
bad,Diversity Gone Wild. Only women get chances with training and management. The job is on the phone all day and managers that never worked for Schwab. Bad decision on my part to join Schwab
bad,You're really nothing more than a number. They want every single second of your time. The Service Center is run like a financial sweat shop and you are chained to the phone from the time you get there until the time you leave.
bad,"I worked for 6 months as part of a small team who were responsible for a plethora of old macros and Winforms apps.  Our goal was to update these old apps to the newer .Net MVC pattern."
bad,"Great place to work. I learned a lot, wish contract would have lasted longer, However, there was no advancement opportunity."
bad,"lack of organizational leadership, poor pay, poor benefits."
bad,The hardest part of the job was being tied to a phone all day with no leniency. Schwab has great products and services but does not treat nor compensate its employees well.
bad,"No recognition, no praise, only a lot of work and if you make any mistakes they jump on you.  They lay off people in San Francisco who had worked here for more than 15 years, and hire replacements in other states because of cost-cutting.  Folks who are in their mid-fifties and putting kids through college are doomed.  They did not consider each employee's situation before they did the cuts."
bad,"As a temp you are limited and separated from the regular Charles Schwab employees and the activities they have. On a daily you are constantly on the phone resetting passwords for clients who are angry and not too tech savvy. Your mission is to stay calm through all situations and resolve the matter. There is no time limit on how fast you resolve the problem, but you need to thorough in how you handle each call and with respect and patience."
bad,"The money and benefits were good at schwab. The workload was heavy and it was a terrible company culture. No one tried to get to know each other, not very friendly, very lonely work environment. You would go in, sit at your desk in your cubicle for 8 hours and stare at a computer screen. Very depressing work environment in my opinion. Not a place to meet friends. Very corporate and very career only oriented."
bad,"We were nested away in a relatively small section of Metrotech Center.  Everyone there except for one or two people actually was a contractor supporting the Schwab NE domain.  The problems we worked on were sophisticated troubleshooting problems generally having to do with whether major connections (which form the backbone of the internet) where up and involved relatively routine troubleshooting tasks and intrusive testing.  Once the source of the problem was identified, it was easy enough to fix. "
bad,"Wow. Great benefits and a wonderful array of products at discounts for employees. The trainers were great and full of enthusiasm, but what they told us to expect...great work environment, team work, supportive leadership, and challenging work, has not come to pass."
bad,"Culture is not what they claim it to be "
bad,"More Managers than associates, cronyism & nepotism rampant...the systems are Stone Age ... serious resistance to innovation. The internal motto is that the Schwab ship is held together with spreadsheets & duct tape."
bad,call center environment - not what was discussed at hiring. Would not recommend as a good work environment. Management treated employees with no respect
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
bad,"The work is extremely complex and challenging. I like this part, but the lack of career advancement is a chronic and can be easily described as poor and unacceptable evidenced by the unusually high turnover rate."
bad,I have worked with in Charles Schwab for 3 years and learn very good things
bad,This is a great place to start a career but the compensation is lacking and the management is too easy influenced
bad,The department I worked in was very stressful with alot of procedure updates that some people had difficulty in following. This led to errors being given without any structure. There was also the efficiency that had to be maintained. So overall it is like working in a sweatshop.
good,You are told at what time to take your breaks and measure by how long our calls take.  Very stressful if you do not like micro management.  Avoid if you can!  Not a normal job environment.
good,At schwab there is lack of advancement. You can move up in pay by going to different departments but it is the same job. Also the start pay for a broker is less many other companies you can work for
good,"Thinking is extagnant, ideas are hard to implement too hierarchical and structured in silo."
good,"Contract/FTE ratio makes it hard to see stability. Lots of internal opportunities to apply to. NSD operates less like a tech desk more like triage customer service, KPIs show that. There are no accurate or real Data Analysis. Could benefit from an experienced Consultant to streamline process and plan effective training to production.  Overall, respective workplace for the most part."
good,"The culture is more of a bank culture than a financial services firm. Management at the director level and above have a lot to be desired. In order to get there, one has to guess and purchase the correct version of that months colored dark robe and hood, know the correct chants, and nail the secret handshake or else you’ll be blackballed in middle management forever."
good,"Schwab is an excellent place to start your career with great opportunities to learn and grow. For mid to senior career project managers, it's easy to get stuck without a good promotion path."
good,"Doesn't matter how much time you put in or what you accomplish - some managers will just think it's ""all part of the job"". Say goodbye to weekends and holidays, even if you're not on call. And don't expect to be recognized for accomplishments."
good,Temporary/contingent workers are treated poorly. There is a lot of jealousy and competition and attempts to keep smart people from advancing. They don't promote handicapped persons or minorities.
good,"Limited advancement and seems cliquish. Advancement is nebulous, managers can vary, some micro management."
good,"The IA group is still growing and the group is very disorganized. The team and business partners primarily work out of West Lake, Texas and Denver, Co."
good,"Micromanaged call center, no autonomy, reports and metrics for everything."
good,Apply only if willing to work in a fast paced environment where a commission can be clawed back from you up to 4 years after the initial sale. The 'treadmill' like sales environment can push the limits.
good,Schwab was a good place to work but not if you are a contractor.  You are excluded from all company functions and there is no comradery with other employees. You live like an outcast
good,good.  No interaction with manager.  worked as contractor.  Didnt report to anyone in particular in there other then immediate mangager.  Contractors are not given importance
good,"It was good, but very quickly people started to leave and never be replaced and the work was still growing. I enjoyed my time but after switching managers 6 times I would like to try something new."
good,"The Company over all is amazing, they treat you well with great benefits and pay but if you get in a bad business unit it can ruin the whole experience for you."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"The Risk Management department is a joke from the 1980's. The systems, processes and tools are very obsolete and lack in so many aspects compared to other firms. So are the leaders that no longer have recent education, training nor the expertise to run a modern risk organization. "
good,Managers are young and inexperienced this is reflected on a daily basis.  Fast paced relentless work environment.  phone calls are non stop for 10 hours a day
good,A lot of long tenured staff who do not have a lot of appetite for change or innovation.  Lots of red tape inhibiting progress.  Middle management mostly concerned with climbing the ladder.
good,"Financial Consultants are underpaid, have taken 3 paycuts in the last 4 years and seem to be the part of the company that gets the worst reputation regardless of success.  "
good,No flexibility froom management. Don't you dare inherit any money while working there because they will automatically assume you plan to leave. That's what they did with me.
good,Some Managers are excellent while other lack common sense or the ability to manage.  A lot of the old regime is leaving and new replacements are not the best.
good,"Great place to start, not to stay."
good,"solid place to get a start in financial services however, don't go in with high expectations. CS is consistently below industry standard in pay (40% under) and with technology usage. Top heavy management structure with a love for committee made (lack of) decisions."
good,I found it a typical experience working for a large firm. The benefits were in line with industry standards. Working from home was not required. The people I worked for and with made the work enjoyable the work could be challenging and rewarding. Though due to the recession I was laid off after the seventh round of layoffs. I certainly would recommend working for Schwab and helped other gain employment while working there.
good,"In the beginning, Charles Schwab was a wonderful culture and seemed like a great place to work. However, the stipulation that requires you to pass the FINRA SIE, Series 7 and Series 66 exams are extremely difficult. I was able to pass the SIE with my first attempt, but was unable to pass my Series 7 exam after two attempts (I got a 68% and 65% on my attempts and you need a 72% to pass). After I failed the series 7 the first time, the entire atmosphere changed at work. My managers were no longer offering help, my co-workers looked at my fellow new hires (who also failed their first attempt, 4 of us failed out of 5) and me as if we were complete morons. Everything that gave me a positive vibe before the exams instantly changed after that first failed attempt. Also, the job itself is taking high volume phone calls about participant 401k accounts, so they have specific metrics that you have to be within. For example, they don't want any one phone call to take more than an average of 10 minutes, but when it takes 3-5 minutes to get someone verified and then get them logged into their account, that 10 minute window came up quick! All it took was one elderly person who needed 25 minutes of help signing into their account and your performance for the day was trashed. My manager had told me time and again that I shouldn't worry about my metrics and focus on the exam material and studying. The only issue I had on the phones were my calls taking a little more than 10 minutes on average. Then once I failed my Series 7 the second time, my manager said, ""Based on your stats on the phones"
good,There are very few women in the tech department. Some of the men are still in the mindset that women don't know as much as they do. It is hard to get promoted as they like to hire management from the outside.
good,"Schwab has long been a good company to work for but unfortunately as it has grown it has lost some of the attractiveness of working for a smaller company, while not keeping up with the investment in people and technology required for a large company."
good,"Depends on your location, SF has a nice, privileged position of superiority. Other offices are viewed as supporting the SF HQ. However if you enjoy your team, have a great manager and appreciate that. Then stay!"
good,I cannot provide a review at this time and do not wish to respond. This should not be a required part of the process. I'm adding unnecessary info to get to the 150 character minimum.
good,The people that work at Schwab are the best part of the job. They have a program to help you gain additional license which is great. Management is held back by upper management which makes the one on one meeting odd.
good,"Great company, growth is limited in Orlando and I feel I have capped out. I would need to relocate in order to continue to further my career. Very collaborative environment."
good,"Schwab was a great place, but in less than a year I had 5 different managers. Having to hit certain numbers is really difficult when you have to keep changing the way you do things. Great place if you are willing to adapt on a recurring basis. Average tenure is 9 months."
good,The role of this position was primarily to sell managed accounts to the customer base. The client base is very loyal to the brand and primarily made up of a do-it-yourself attitude.  Customers are very neglected due to overwhelming workload requirements and varied levels of support.  If you have been internal to the company then the transition is more easily adaptable. Sales requirements are reasonable but very difficult to reach depending on the book of business assigned. Your success is dependent on your manager's ability to guide and support you which is a very limited.  Overall a very good job but very difficult to succeed unless you are well connected.
good,"Schwab is all about advocating for clients, which is a wonderful thing. That said, it is very difficult to succeed in the role as a new Financial Consultant.  The only way to get paid is to have new assets come in or to convert a client in to managed money, appropriate or not."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"The company offers good benefits. However, from my experience I saw to much micromanaging going on."
good,"Great place to work, good compensation and benefits. "
good,"productive work environment, very good at training and preparing their employees"
good,"Had an enjoyable work opportunity, until someone decided to outsource the work. Very good benefits. Something happened to values and management. May explain the condition of the work place now."
good,"Schwab is a great place to work to start a career, there is little room for advancement unless you are favored.  Good benefits, pay is below industry standards"
good,Its a decent place to get started in the financial industry but you will quickly learn that the culture that is sold is not accurate.  Unrealistic goals and it is a call center so everything is matrix driven and one day sales is important the next it call length.
good,The role was not a qood fit for me and I struggled to meet the companys expectations. I had a hard time adhering to all the specific processes and questions that needed to be reviewed on every call. Their systems were a patchwork of disparate programs that were hard to manage.
good,Worked there for close to two years before I was recruited my a PE fund. Great people and great environment. Terrible pay with no room to grow. 10 min breaks with a 30 min lunch.
good,"Was not told that it was a Call Center when I interviewed.  The work on the phones is brutal, 10 hours a day, mostly helping clients with check requests or password resets. They overstated the pay potential and bonus increases and the fact that you have to spend 18 months within the Call Center environment, even after you become a Broker.  Most Reps I work with dread going to work every day and constantly being under the clock to meet Management's never ending numbers criteria.  If you enjoy being on the phone all day answering call after call with the same monotonous string of requests, this is the job for you."
good,"Worked as an AFSP and CSP during my time at Schwab. Went through training, multiple licensing exams, then eventually picked up additional responsibilities like handling fraud claims, ID theft, and banking systems."
good,"Charles Schwab is great place to learn the finance business, you'll learn sales and marketing while you work leads they provide.  You can build good relationships but Schwab will on the client so it can be hard to leave or have an opinion of your own."
good,Charles Schwab is the gold standard of investing and has amazing people.  The problem is in management.  Very hard to get ahead unless you have buddies in management and advancement is based on who you know not what you know.
good,"fun place to work very professional "
good,Great starting point. Management could be better at coaching and guidance. It can get political in the retail branches. With new CRM software you can see who is working and who is coasting.
good,Schwab was a great stepping stone in my career. This is not a job I could see myself doing long term. But for the right person It is a decent job. Just know this is basically a call center if you are very customer service driven and don't mind taking 60-70 calls a day then it may work for you.
good,I've worked for Schwab for more than a decade and during this time there has always been change. Change is good but when you have too much it is not. It is really hard to get ahead.  There are lots of different systems to navigate and its more important to be in your seat and cya than it is to be productive.  Pay and benefits are meh. People for the most part are nice but most of them will not tell you the truth.  Very political and feels somewhat like working for the good ole boys.  People in general are overworked and burnned out.
good,"Good company but but do not want to be on the phones anymore. I joined in 2012, and it was a good expereicne , learned a lot and its good experieince."
good,"Its a good platform to start your career off, im just looking for something a little different at this point. I wish the compensation was better than it is"
good,"The management was less than ideal."
good,"During my tenure with the company, I liked the fact that company was getting the focus back on customer experience and realizing that to be the key to their Wall Street performance."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"Schwab is a great company to start at. They have great products you can feel comfortable being involved with. But it's a dead-end unless you plan on kissing bum and acting like a phony for the next 15+ years to get anywhere. Get your licenses, as many as you can, and experience - but keep your resume updated for much bigger opportunities."
good,A very informative company as far as financial information.....and money management
good,"Company pays well with fair health benefits, good vacation benefit, a bonus program,  stock options & restricted stock for good performance, and sabbaticals every 5 years. It is a demanding environment often working long hours and extra work days with tight commitments and perform more with less. There's essentially two management cultures - one business side and one IT. From my interaction and what I have observed from the business side, it is definitely the better side to work. Business side is customer focused and they make sure the staff is also happy so that it comes across to the customers. The company has become more rigid with working hours, work location, and ability to work remotely. Many have been asked to relocate as positions were relocated to another state. Most enjoyable part of working there is the constant challenge to develop innovative solutions as cost effective as possible."
good,"An estates representative works with people who just lost a loved one and are calling to collect their inheritance. It is a hard job and not for everyone. When I was there we had a massive back log and were trying new team structures, there were a lot of experienced people leaving, and management was a mess. I heard good things about how it was before the backlog so I can't give an unbiased opinion. They feed you though so wen you are doing the requested overtime you at least have dinner."
good,financial services organization serves all of the community regarding their financial services plan. Not too maybe diverse employees within the management office
good,"Great middle America work force, work/life balanced and extremely friendly, supportive team environment. Very non-political, enjoyable work environment. Highly segregated officer ranks from daily work force. Little leadership accountability. Skewed, extremely public and accelerated affirmative action efforts setting up young professionals to fail. Highly political executives, self preservation mode. Talk-the-talk, not walk-the-walk."
good,The work done day-to-day is quite enjoyable but the work culture can be overdone dependent on which career track you're placed on. There are a lot of governmental processes to go through for a typical day of development due to the company's size and as such may not be the best to aim for if you're wanting a truly lightweight/agile work environment.
good,Schwab is so large it is hard to review the company for all areas.  Schwab is growing and not hiring extra head count to keep down costs.  This has effected the work life balance.  Taking vacations are almost impossible.  They do offer great benefits and pay but do not take care of their employees.  At Schwab you are a number and the company is so large it is hard to see the whole picture.
good,Very repetitive days and adherence is the only thing managers care about because it is reflected on them. Only 30 minutes allowed for lunch. 401k match is nice.
good,Used to be a cutting edge company trying to be a leader in the stock market.   Now they are lost in the world of Agile without understanding Agile methodologies.  It was time to move on.
good,"Culture has slipped.  Management has flipped and micro management has become more prevalent."
good,"typical work day is long heavy work load small department learned how to read accurately a credit report, learned rules and regulations of bank operations. Responsible for preventing risk to the company saving the company from any type of fraud. Built relationships with outside banks to verify funds.  Service several daily reports for Bank side and Broker Dealer side."
good,"With all the geographical strategies to move jobs from San Francisco to Denver, morale is low and career advancement for those in SF is limited. Many newly hired managers enjoy playing politics and are interested in their own career advancement.  The work culture has changed and deteriorated from 2000."
good,I enjoyed working there but it was years ago.  i really cannot speak to what working there now would be like.  The role was in a call center and was challenging as the hours were difficult.
good,"It's a call center so if you like having to be tied to a phone and have your adherence monitored by your manager then you will be fine. Like most call centers, many employees leave once they figure this out."
good,"Schwab is a good company but they are actively cutting spending by cutting people's pay. It's easy to think they are ""not like the other guys"" but they are doing the same thing- just trying to up their ROA. Shame to see a company with potential turn so greedy."
good,Busy all day. Computer input and verification of assets high priority. Responsible for mistakes need for accurate data input. Team approach for heavy volumes
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,Charles Schwab offers great growth opportunity if you are interested in the financial industry or becoming a financial consultant or broker. If you work in the job as one of the support roles to the brokerage the job has substantially less growth.
good,"I review and critique phone calls, processing, and procedures for multiple departments. I assist with improving and writing current and new procedures. Meeting facilitator. I assist with reducing errors and creating Quality Control Reporting, and cross training of current and new employees.  Schwab has been a great company to learn and become experienced in several areas and aspects of the financial industry. The hardest part of the job is not having enough staff for the volume of work that we have. The management is not as fair and open to suggestions and preferred. The workplace culture is great as far as work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning and the opportunity to polish up on my leadership skills."
good,"Pay was higher than normal."
good,"Nice, dedicated people. Large financial corporation, a lot of processes and procedures, legal dependencies and bureaucracy. Overall is okay company to work for."
good,"Great mangers, Co workers, and great environment. Calls are non stop, no where to really advance to no matter what they say. Long hours with not enough breaks and the shifts are awful. Little to no vacation time"
good,"It is a good company, with some good people working there. Diversity and Inclusion program needs work. Diverse group of empathetic floor coaches needed for stressful departments. Empathy, sensitivity and people skills focused training would be helpful."
good,"Just did a Capstone Project."
good,Lacks diversity but a great place to learn about corporate America. A lot of in-house politics. Good experience for the time I was there.  Great product!
good,This is a great company and I loved working for them. The managers are very supportive and willing to help you get to the next level. Great company overall.
good,My job consisted of being on the phones.  It's a mentally exhausting job. They also seem to hire from the outside to fill the high management jobs. There's a lot of company politics.
good,Schwab is a challenging work environment and has great customer focus. The company is very driven to manage the P&L very tightly which causes the environment to be a bit start and stop with investments.
good,management put lots of pressure on employees to keep up with service levels.  The decisions that management made didn't make sense most of the time.  Was a good place to work when I first started.
good,Good company with great benefits.  Customer focused company that ensures the customers goals are met.  The culture promotes an environment whereby you can learn and grow.
good,"Here I work as a big data developer, hadoop pig spark, SQOOP, Flume, hdfs, Java scala and oracle database."
good,My managers provided me with consistent cascading communications and an effortless management style.  My time at Charles Schwab provided with valuable experience to the next level of my career.
good,"Worked at Schwab for nearly 3 years as a Registered Rep.  The compensation was very low, and the job was grueling.  Far too much emphasis placed on time-adherence and other numbers.  Low overall morale in the building."
good,If you wanted to move higher as a Financial Analyst at Schwab in Austin there wasn't much room for improvement because 401k was the only growth options or customer service/IT. These weren't my specialties.
good,The potential is there but the overall culture needs work. What is desired from MANAGEMENT at the corporate level -- and the reality in the field are completely different.
good,"Its OK, worked in the 401k department. Managers are nice but you have to be able to shut off your mind to critical thinking and accept blatant corporatism. Hopefully its changed since I left"
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,call center answering client calls. Long days of 60 calls per day.  Various shifts available. Fast paced training. Must adapt quickly to changes in systems and regulatory
good,"Charles Schwab is a company in flux, making it difficult for many employees to adjust.  It does offer excellent benefits, but there are many decisions about the business being made that leave many of the employees unsure about their future."
good,Schwab is a good place to learn about the financial services industry.  They are phone driven in communication with a branch network to support client needs.
good,"This is a good place to work, unfortunately sometimes there are people with poor management skills."
good,"Started out promising until management decided to restructure even in spite of record profits.  Positions, among them mine, were recreated in other cheaper cities and we were laid off."
good,Large operation with many areas of opportunity to advance. Business has several areas for relocation if needed.  Variety of people to work with.  Very open to diversity.
good,"High pressure sales environment.  sales volume matters more that client satisfaction.  Bait and switch environment.  Get the client in the door with low fees, the sell them a managed portfolio at 1% fee."
good,"Calendar management"
good,Lot of meetings and talking. Hardly to get the time for development and real work. They use lot of customizations. I learned lot in multi cross platforms.
good,"Nice location on the Bay."
good,The SF office is no longer the future of Schwab.  Denver is where the opportunities are unless you are hired in as an SVP or above. The firm is well positioned to benefit from rising interest rates.
good,"Everyone is nice and management is good but the job is tedious and the same thing everyday, there isn't much room for growth within the company and it takes forever to meet the ""hurdles"" you have to jump to move up."
good,a good challenge right out of college. It was a long time ago so I don't really remember a lot about this experience.  It did provide me with licensing
good,Opportunities to grow and be recognized are available if you position has bandwidth that allows for it.  It's a good company to work at if you are starting your career or looking to gain experience you didn't have coming in.
good,"cross training opportunities, good co workers, pay was lower end, good learning and training provided to get licensing, flexible hours, good team environment"
good,"The work enviornment was very professional,diverse and cultured. Plenty of quality products to choose from , and the employees are well versed in knowledge of all of the products."
good,"Fun to work if you have a close relationship with your manager and have many friends."
good,"What management (at the branch, regional and national levels) states is important and what is actually important are not always in agreement. If you are willing to play the game you can do well."
good,"Schwab was a great place to work at times, but was hit hard by falling interest rates and a management team that couldn't figure out how to respond.  The leadership team is conservative, for example, Schwab implemented drug testing at a time when most companies were eliminating it because of the extremely low return on the investment.  The best part of Schwab are the people who still care about clients and doing what's right for them."
good,AS Services is known for having an exceptionally high turnover rate due to the organization's high demands and low pay.
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"Charles Schwab provides great training and maintains high standards of ethics."
good,"I received no training. I learned everything through trial and error, which I must say is an inefficient way to run a company. I was told that everyone in my dept started as a contractor, yet they decided to create my same position within the company, hired someone else and gave her work that would have otherwise come to me. I had some busy weeks, but mostly I was bored out of my mind, constantly asking different managers for work. Then, half the time, I would be told by my direct manager that I couldn't do that work because it didn't fall under my department's duties. Talk about passing the buck. I understand that for risk management purposes, some things need to stay isolated, but there were some tasks that definitely fell within our department. She just didn't want to take the time to teach me, which is ridiculous because any instructions I got from her were delivered in less than 2 min."
good,"The workplace is very nice aesthetically and rather laid back, but co-workers are rather childish.  I thought this was only on my team but soon I learned it was across the board.  The people behaved very much like we were in high school.  The technology can be glitchy and you are expected to deal with it.  They do have on-site and phone-based technicians to resolve your tech issues but the this can often take a chunk of time away from you and you are still required to meet your deadlines. ...This happens often.  The coffee is free but it sucks, the cafeteria makes great breakfast and good lunch with special visiting vendors."
good,"Depending on what you come in as, opportunity is limited. If you are thinking of a soft sales role this is the place to be. Great opportunity for those interested in a sales type role."
good,"Normal experience of working for a big company, good benefits, never take anything home with you but trying to do something new or change something is very hard to accomplish and needs several levels of appoval"
good,"Managers, who call the shots and dictate the roadmap, don't have real knowledge of trading or the client base that they are looking to acquire. The company is still focused on building products for a generation of soon to be retirees."
good,At Charles Schwab the day's are always busy. You are there to build the relationship between the company and the client. I loved getting to build rapports with my clients.
good,"This is a steady environment, laid back. They provide a lot of information on health and environment."
good,I did intern stuff- I worked with the high net-worth clients - classifying their accounts into Schwab's membership program
good,Schwab always made sure their expectations were very clear and sales objectives were very obtainable. They had a very clear cut path for all employees and if followed per their instructions appeared to work for many
good,"Fees too high on programs, car salesmen attitude to move money over to them."
good,"Arrive at work, put your mind into the job, consistently learn the profession."
good,Always standing and carrying the workload for others.  The compensation is inadequate compared to industry averages.  Benefits are sufficient though.
good,"Great place to start your career, but you would not or should not stay here more than 5 years to get started."
good,"Typical large corporation environment.  Top down priorities, highly matrixed, etc.  Consensus driven culture, initiatives require buy in and support from multiple levels and departments."
good,This is a good company but wish there would have been more opportunity to move through out the company.
good,"Good Company, Corporate Culture, Limited Advancement Opportunities"
good,"Worked in call center and provided customer service to clients."
good,I learned a lot at Charles Schwab. The financial industry is constantly moving and there are lots of departments there.
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"I managed two teams within the Stock Plan Services group, was a member of the leadership team. I had very positive reviews from my team and also other members of the leadership team."
good,"Job security, forget raises, no incentives. Slow to change"
good,Every one is an individual contributor and has a strong team bonding.
good,"Enjoy working with co-workers, and current team manager. Great culture for meeting co-workers, and understanding what they do for the company. Enjoy teaching others and building relationships the most."
good,"I performed a number of different roles during my nearly 5-years with Charles Schwab. It was a company that rapidly evolved to become one of the premier discount brokerage firms. At the time I was there, they had a strong culture and a proud tradition."
good,Good values and good management. Could be more efficiently structured.
good,"Nice environment to work with good reputation as a good company to work for but individual ideas or creativity is not encouraged. Hires good people based on personality and potential, but does not utilize their ability to full potential."
good,Good job working with customer service team. I was busy and learned much about the company.
good,"Not much flexibility but paid well.  No opportunity for flexible schedule.  Brilliant, organized and friendly coworkers.  The hire the best and talented employees"
good,Employees at manager level and below are great. Higher level leaders seem to not want to rock the boat so they don't challenge senseless policies. Getting funding for any upgrades to technology or work tools is next to impossible.
good,"Depending upon the group, the feedback might change!"
good,"Schwab can be a good place to work depending on the manager.  I liked the people that I worked with, but the culture went through a few different changes with manager changes."
good,Schwab is a good company and does have its perks but they need to be more cognizant of work/life balance.  The style of management is very old-school and there needs to be a shift in mindset.
good,"Management is very rigid and not receptive to new people and ideas.  Too numbers focused versus value added.  Great place to get experience and licenses but unless you fit into their mold, you will not go far and be very frustrated."
good,"Direct management is okay but management above them act like they own the world. Some have less experience than the workers and are more bosses than leaders; Unprofessional in approach and have poor coaching skills. For example, my manger was a piece of caca and had no banking or investment experience. As predicted they got rid of him, goes to show they'll hire any unqualified person for management."
good,"Good company overall, no room for advancement unless you want to get licenses.  No real collaboration, teambuilding events, somewhat stale environment."
good,"Management and work culture is inconsistent. There’s a good amount of lip service given by leadership regarding care and concern to matters important to employees, and to the fostering and maintaining of an environment that is creative, dynamic and conducive to employee engagement, but the opposite tended to be true."
good,"Once a great place to work the recent changes in culture and negative attitude toward employees have significantly diminished the Schwab of old."
good,"Good Work-life Balance. But a very laid back environment and someone who is an enthusiast to try and explore new avenue, this is not the place for you."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,The culture is changing significantly it used to be a great company to work for.  In recent years the growth has not been managed properly so it has lead to some political infighting.
good,"It has been too many years since I have been there to have an accurate view. At the time, I enjoyed it very much and felt supported. however, I have heard the culture has changed dramatically in the years since I was there."
good,"Great culture & caring professional work force "
good,"With the fast-changing regulatory environment, there's always something to work on. Depending on which org branch your department falls under, you might receive significant support from management or you might slip through the cracks. I would suggest asking what percentage of the company's project dollars are allocated to your department/team on an annual basis; that should give you a good idea of where you'll stand."
good,Schwab is an ethical firm that does right by its customers. Chuck has ensured that his legacy will not be touched by scandal. Culture differs greatly across the org. My group culture was dysfunctional. The managers did not want want to do any work or produce anything. They just told me to sit at my desk all day. They were all just collecting massive paychecks and counting down the days until retirement. Most boring job I've ever had. However coworkers in other areas had vastly different experiences. It all depends upon your immediate chain of management.
good,"Not a bad place. management is mixed and ideas are mixed.Allows for work from home at times which is helpful."
good,Charles Schwab offers excellent benefits but lacks work-life balance.  It is a competitive environment with the ability to move around as many positions become available in a short period of time.
good,A positive working environment with a lot of hardworking people. A large and challenging workload that allowed for you to learn new skills.  Everyone worked very hard and looked to help each other and the clients despite not being paid enough considering the large workload.  A culture that puts a premium on the customer experience and working hard to meet customer expectations.
good,"Good place to start. You will learn a lot. Work/life balance can be tough. Great people and a great organization. I enjoyed my stay there. However, I wanted to branch out."
good,it takes a long time to get anywhere at Schwab and there are no clear paths to get to where you want to go. Management is of little help in that area. They do have quarterly and annual bonus and a strong 401k match.
good,"Administering sales/purchase ledger"
good,"The company has better benefits than most companies, they offer some dependent care pay, 5 year sabbaticals, and just began paid maternity leave."
good,"Handled latest Technologies and very Enthusiastic Team workers, Its an challenging environment where we can show our Talent. Our work will be acknowledged."
good,"We were always very busy in the operations department.  I enjoyed the people I worked with they were very friendly and knowledgeable.  I enjoyed learning about the financial industry and helping people.   The most challenging part of my job was working with clients who lost money.  Which I learned after awhile that this really was the industry for me.    Even though I was advising on trades working in this industry wasn't something I wanted to do anymore. I still support Schwab and the markets.  It's just me personally not wanting to have anything to do with the handling of other people's finances.  9-11 came and the crash,  I had my daughter and needed a change."
good,"Great place to work if you desire to be a broker in the industry, work life balance and benefits are good as well. would return if an opportunity presented itself"
good,Management can have too high expectations which are difficult to meet setting you up to fail.  Money is good. Work long and hard.
good,"When I first started there, the culture was strong and I was in love with the company.  They hired in house and had a strong sense of loyalty and affection for employees.  As the years got harder, layoff's, hiring outside the company and temp's really brought the culture to a halt.  It was no longer a family company and it became all about the bottom line.  It wasn't a fun place to work at the end. "
good,"Compensation is below industry standards.  High turnover.  A good place for entry-level and those early in their careers to gain experience, but not really a long-term career option."
good,The wealth of knowledge I learned is what I most value. The employee engagement was very encouraging and it is a very diverse company when it comes to it's employees and purpose. I quickly learned that job security is what was lacking. I don't have too many negatives to say. It was a great stepping stone for me in my career.
good,"A day in the life of a Advisor Service Representative is to review emails for policy changes and new SEC regulations.  Follow up on items that were not completed the day before.  Run various reports such as call stats and number of work items that need to be processed to meet service standards.  Assist the Advisor with their client's needs such as account opening, transfers/money movement, cost basis, corporate actions/tender offers, educating on changes to industry procedures.  Work closely with other departments within Schwab to educate and be educated on their processes.  The hardest part of the job for me was being on a rotating schedule.  Having a young family can be challenging to meet their needs when there are schedule conflicts.  The most enjoyable job was getting to learn about other departments, what they do and how that works in the Schwab model."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,Lots of training provided. Call center environment so you're constantly on the phone.
good,"When the stock market was great, so was the morale of the employees. When the marker wasn't great, the morale was not good. Great bonuses though when times were good."
good,"Every single detail of your day is planned, organized, and monitored. If you are into that, Schwab is for you. If not, seek employment elsewhere."
good,"Schwab has grown large and no longer nimble.  The technology groups are silo'd and to be successful, you'll need to establish strong relationships across the company."
good,"Contact firms, handle transfers, move money, client calls etc.."
good,"I believe Schwab overall is a solid company with integrity, but I have not enjoyed my job with them. Being in a call center environment is not for me, being told exactly when I can take breaks and lunches, and not being able to get vacation without scheduling it several weeks out. "
good,There are so few advancement opportunities and there are no performance based salary increases.....a higher level position opens up inthe service center and like 75 people apply for one position.
good,"Good benefits, little change to move up. Would recommend looking elsewhere."
good,"This is a great place to work fresh out of college, but you have to change teams in order to advance. Very little knowledge transfer, constantly updated procedures, communication is either too much or not enough."
good,"I have worked for a long time in the IT at this place, and it has been impossible to advance. I feels like a stereotype is placed on you and you get into a pigeonhole. Only few people manage to break out."
good,"It's a very ethical company in financial services.  Always adapting and evolving, but your experience and satisfaction really depends on the group you're in.  They have really scaled back hiring in San Francisco, lots of layoffs.  They don't always do a great job at promoting employees.  Again, career development and advancement depends on your group and not at all consistent across the company.  Pay is below average in the SF Bay Area."
good,"A typical workday for me as a team lead, involved SDLC project mgmt meetings with business and other development teams, as well as internal team coaching, reviews and testing."
good,"Great people to work with and the culture is a testament to it. I believe this is a great place to work, especially the benefits they provide. I would recommend working here."
good,"DO NOT APPLY.  Even highly educated and well paid workers are given tiny cubicles with very low walls .  Coworkers sit at their desks 3 feet behind you at most, as they very  loudly lead conference calls and give presentations, and it is literally impossible to focus.  Some workers leave their smart phone ringers on and you get to also hear that all  day.  You cannot work from home to escape the horrible conditions. DO NOT APPLY --  We have a highly diverse work force culturally.  A disproportionate number of  folks don't bathe often  and they literally try to cover their odor up with perfume or baby powder.  Because we are so densely packed in you literally smell them coming down the aisle.  Lord help you if they stop at your desk.  You have no escape.  Sometimes two or three of them Walk closely by with competing perfume and baby powder.  These are truly horrid  working conditions.  DO NOT APPLY HERE.  I am literally Counting down the days til I can get out"
good,Good culture but lacks job security in San Francisco. You need to be with the firm for a long time to move up in position. Management is supportive.
good,"Typical day at work for the past year I was there was doing outcalls to review wire transfer instructions from client that initiated these requests via the web.  Ensuring that all the information was correct and processing their request."
good,Good interaction with Managers and peers. Healthy Management. Self starting job. They invest in trainings.
good,"Senior Business Analyst & Project Manager - International Services"
good,"Schwab can be a great company but it is fairly restrictive. You'll typically start out on an inbound call center team, answering 60-120 calls per day. There is the option to move around, but not as much upward mobility as one might desire. The roles are really structured and there isn't much freedom to adapt the role to you, you have to adapt to the role. "
good,"This is a solid and safe place to work. I was fortunate enough to work on the one team that was fun and lively with the most personality. Since most the employees here are 40 yrs old and older you can tell that their team cultures are quiet and dull in comparison. It's a very head down with your headphones environment that doesn't breed excitement. As a company if you want to learn and take on more work to help expand your experience and knowledge they are great at doing so. but, when it comes to advancement this is not the place you want to be. It's a complacent place to be. Because there is very little types of levels (manager, Senior, Director, SVP and above) most people are Senior level, but have remained so for many years. While the company is eager to think with innovation as often as possible it is also a company/industry that is very slow moving and projects and ideas need to be voted by large majorities which can take a project that requires 2 months from start to finish, to taking a year to complete. Also, compared to competitors Schwab is the lost paying  by a good $15k per salary.Overall, if you are a working parent this is a great company that has solid ground and an easy going culture that allows flexibility to balance your personal life. Most people leave the office and don't check their emails after 5pm, nor the weekends. That actually is great in the sense where you can disengage immediately. Good company, but not if you are an achiever that wants to do and be more."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"Schwab is a company with a variety of opportunities from cashiering to management. The company offers many benefits such as healthcare, 401k and other brokerage accounts."
good,"If you love securities and trading, Schwab will offer only so much.  Good place to start off and learn, or end up when your done trading and just want to manage from now on.  They treat you well.  Pay is below avg./ but benefits are top notch and make up for some of it.  It's relaxed and for the most part enjoyable.  Real ambitious types won't thrive, but with kids and a family that needs stability, this should work ok."
good,Management of the business and culture are some of the strongest attributes.
good,"Great benefits and compensation"
good,"work life balance is good. Compensation is decent but not in the high side of the industry for similar jobs. Have good people, easy and intelligent to work with. and as the same in many large size company, lots of bureaucracy"
good,I only worked there for a short period of time but the people were nice & the pay was good. I left because my heart & passion is in real estate.
good,"Schwab has a great workplace culture and friendly atmosphere.  "
good,The company has a great atmosphere to be around.  Everyone is friendly and happy to help and train you to further your success.
good,"nice"
good,"started work at 630am - 300pm"
good,"Started out great company, management and comfort level decreased when I finally received new position"
good,"Prefer not to say as i am still working a contract with the, with that said the environment they put off for contractors is very ""less than"" compared to the full time employees and id do not like this."
good,The employees are not treated well by the management. Lack of advancement opportunities.
good,"The overall company is great. The call center environment is very stressful. Of course it depends on who your manager is. That makes all the difference. If you have an experienced, supportive manager, you will have a better experience."
good,"Acquisition by Schwab  altered culture from small firm with great culture to 13,000 person firm with remote management."
good,After 5 years of Senior Level Service dismissed out of hiring sequence.
good,"Charles Schwab is all about company culture- creating an inviting and friendly place to work.  They strive to create a work-life balance, but it is not always possible.  Advancement from within can be difficult based on the organization you are in - sometimes it is about who you know and not what you have proven."
good,There is really no working remotely allowed - or it is seriously looked down upon.  It's a good ol boys club for sure with extreme office politics.  How well you do your job is not anywhere near the top for desired employees.
good,"This was a relaxing fun place to work despite the constant pressure of the stock market."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"Charles Schwab Corporation is an excellent company, but i feel that the El Paso operations location does not, what-so-ever, align with the Charles Schwab values or mission statement. Supervisors create cliques, display favoritism, and are opposed to subordinates' career development."
good,"I worked here for 17 years.  Good workplace, good benefits development, good culture and they do their fare share in developing their employees, but their geo-strategy is causing a lot of San Francisco employees to leave or relocate"
good,"The primary focus of job was to guide and help existing Financial Advisors with large amounts of stock to trade or smaller amounts of stock that dosen't trade a lot while ensuring to get the best price in the best manner for the client. Customer Service always comes first and foremost.Something new was learned everyday and everyday had a new challenge. It is imperative in this position that a ""team"" player attitude be adopted and maintained in everyday work."
good,Too much stressful work. Expected to work 24*7. Workers are not friendly at all. No facilities are provided to the employees.
good,The people working around me were easy to get along and had a diverse office environment. The office location was close to my home which allowed me to come in very early and leave early. Flexible culture which is what I needed.
good,"Good Place. "
good,A typical day is answering phone calls for issues ranging from tech to transfers to moving money and even estate processing. Once you've been there a few months the repetition and monotony of your workday is absolute. Management seems to know what they are doing and the culture is good. If you want to do the same thing every day for years to come and get paid decently for easy work this is for you.
good,Overall good company with a nice workplace culture and evolving technologies. Encourages to take up new roles and responsibilities. Best place to learn especially for freshers and trainees.
good,"Overall, a great place to learn and get experience, but you have to navigate the extensive back stabbing and office politics that are prevalent throughout the corporation.  They excel at tag lines, but it's a slog if you are in customer facing role."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is assisting clients with their needs. "
good,Management hires from their favorites in the Charitable Operations department. Was promised full time employment while on a temporary assignment. I exceeded expectations and was not hired once it was time to transition. I wouldn't suggest to come in as a temporary assignment.
good,"This is a good place to start your career.  Moving up is difficult at best for most people, but not completely unheard of.  The challenge is that  the organization is pretty flat and turnover at the top is low.  However, turnover at the bottom tends to be really high."
good,"Great company and wonderful people t ok work with. The job is very broad and you learn a lot.  Unfortunately the training for the position was very minimal, which made learning the job extremely difficult."
good,"Oversee the day-to-day workflow of the team of associates. Verified that all mutual funds and ETF confirmations with prospectus are processed each day and are mailed within a service deadline of trade plus one day. This company provided an environment that respects and appreciates the diversity of employees, clients and the communities. Every co-worker displayed integrity and strived to surpass goals and also ensured the brand name of Schwab will be represented while processing their job duties. The hardest part of the job is working grave shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was being involved with co-workers on a daily basis. The environment was like being with your own family. Everyone was so engaged with each other that people tended to share their personal problems in life."
good,"It is a learning experience working there. There is a lot of training and workplace culture is good. I enjoy coming into work and know what I need to do and do it,"
good,"Although the culture is a bit odd, this was a great place to work with a lot of involvement in the community and investment in their employees.  Management really cares about success."
good,This was my very first job out of college with a degree and it was a great opportunity to receive. The culture is very vibrant and welcoming. I would recommend any college student to apply here. Great start pay and bonuses along with benefits.
good,The culture is really good. Everyone is genuinely nice which I appreciate.I would definitely recommend working at Schwab. I have enjoyed my time there very much.
good,"Processes change constantly, and the work is very fast paced, but the employees are genuinely caring and very intelligent people."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,There is lot innovation going on in parts of the company.  While other parts are still working with technology from last century.  Depends where you work will determine your level of satisfaction.
good,Good people and product offerings for clients. Company makes it easy to do the right thing for clients and put the clients first. Have referred friends and family.
good,Management is fantastic. Opportunities of advancement could be limited depending on what department you work in. Personal financial management has ample opportunities.
good,It is a work friendly location and takes good care of employees.Had a great time working with them and willing to work with and for them in the future.
good,I worked in 2 major offices for the firm.  In the larger more competitive city the office atmosphere was positive and there was a tremendous effort to make it a great place to work.  In the smaller office where the firm was the only major player the attitude was so different.  Hours were longer with no options for work/life balance.
good,This is a good place to work.  Not always the highest pay but not the lowest.  I have worked there many years and until recently have been happy. Guess you can get a bad supervisor anywhere!
good,Schwab is good place to grow a career. Company does a great job of helping employees continue to grow and a big focus on career development. Very employee and client focused.
good,I worked event staff at a Charles Schwab. I had a pay slightly of minimum wage and overall was worth my time. As event staff it was a good way to get some extra money. Definitely not my best or worst event staff job.
good,"Large company with established client base, now trying to catch up with other online competitors in the B2C web space. Great team, but needs better management direction."
good,A good place to work. I enjoy being there and very helpful people. The interview process is long and there are several interviews to go to. It is work the wait.
good,"C level leadership great, pay not so much. If you want to move up, you have to move out. Company prefers to hire externally than develop internal talent."
good,"Schwab is a great place to work for many reasons, but they continue to reduce their footprint in San Francisco.  Be careful when considering work in the main office."
good,Schwab is a good place to work. The management tries hard to respect individual performers. The work can be monotonous and frequently gets bogged down by legal and compliance restraints.
good,I managed the end to end automated engineering flow like from build - > code review - > unit test - > deploy - > monitor using on-premise and cloud engineering systems developed by the various development teams in the organization.
good,place to learn many thing and leverage technical skills. Good to learn the business knowledge about the security domain. Potential opportunities in DWH area.
good,"I worked with a team of highly talented, driven, and hardworking individuals who felt a strong connection to the company's purpose. The company had great benefits for their employees and management took a strong interest in employee personal and professional growth. Charles Schwab operates on a strict moral code and I am proud to have worked for such a company."
good,Relaxed culture with overall nice people. Very good place to start because of culture. Unfortunately because of the relaxed culture they have a lot of lazy people that stick around
good,"Lots of opportunities if you're willing to put in the hard work.  HR is a a mess and has lost loyalty to/from long-term employees.  HR will toss out long-termers due to stupid ""rules""."
good,"Good place to work if your not a contractor. The pay is above normal and management was great. As a contractor you are not allowed to the good meetings. You know, the ones that should be called a party. Your left doing everyone's work load while they go to a fancy dinner or movie. Happened enough times to get under my skin."
good,"Too old school and conservative, not with the current times, if you aren't with the status quo good luck keeping employed there"
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,8 am to 5 pm mon thru fri. typical data analyst position that required a lot of attention to detail. took in coming and made out going calls to client to facilitate there account problem resolution.
good,If you're looking for a large firm with a penchant for ethics and values in the investment world then Schwab is the place to be in the Phoenix valley
good,"The overall day can be hectic with many issues and fires to be put out from my various advisors, and it makes for a busy day. The reward of the job is knowing we are helping our end clients provide quality financial assistance in giving there clients more knowledge in growing there nest egg for retirement. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co workers who always make themselves available for complex issues and create a real team player environment."
good,"From our team leader to my co-workers, everyone at Charles Schwab was friendly and personable on a daily basis.  Overall a great place to work."
good,"*Schwab employees are free to solve problems, to innovate, and to challenge the status quo. It's a place where you have an opportunity to do your best work."
good,"great environment"
good,"decent pay, good 401k match and employee stock options, benefits use to be good but they changed and are decent at best, good people, it is a call center"
good,Company has excellent benefits and works to provide work life balance for most individual contributor roles. Most co-workers are friendly and interested in providing customer service.
good,"Charles Schwab was a great place to learn about corporate America.  I learned a great deal of what goes into it and how much support staff you need around you to be successful.  My daily duties consist of wire transfer for clients and batching out check deposits for the customers.  It was not a stressful job as they tried their best to not put a lot of pressure on anyone, but you were still expected to complete your daily task."
good,"Typical day was daly managing of branch office"
good,Charles Schwab is a great company to work for. I love my coworkers and the opportunity to network.
good,"Nice place to work, but would recommend leadership to develop better people skills."
good,Focus is on Customer.  Technology is current. Long hours and demanding place to work.
good,"Schwab is a very progressive brokerage firm with technology and a multitude of services for any prospective client."
good,I have enjoyed my time at Charles Schwab.  The management team have challenged me and allowed opportunity for growth and extra projects.
good,Opened to new ideas.  Encourages employees to always look at ways to improve on how things are done.
good,"Great work environment that allowed access to different areas of Investment Management (Trading, Research, Operations). Excellent upper management who were hands-on and always willing to help. Strong loyalty."
good,"Excelled in a customer service and administrative role, where I directly managed high-revenue client relationships for the purpose of asset retention and business development. Acted as a relationship manager for 300 affluent households, with net assets totaling over $300 million. Enhanced investor relationships by discussing and evaluating their financial plans. Used software to analyze the investors’ stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Organized and made presentations to affluent clients. Helped implement and monitor their savings, retirement, and investment strategies."
good,• Collaborated with management team in the rollout of call center test project that pioneered trades and quotes through telephone voice recognition software systems.
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,A good company and I believe on their focus on the client experience and transparency.  Difficult to remain in the SF Bay area in a headquarters role.
good,Charles Schwab was a great employer but began to degrade at the end of my tenure.  Multiple departments had competing agendas that made it difficult to work 100% for the client.
good,The culture at Schwab used to be great but has deteriorated significantly over the last several years.  Management has been preaching the do more with less philosophy for the last several years.  As far as financial services and products offered to clients I believe that Schwab is a top notch and ethical financial services firm.
good,Schwab is an energized and enjoyable work environment.  Plenty of challenges to alleviate boredom.  It is a fast paced environment that keeps you on your toes.
good,Decent company to work for.  Very ethical and professional.  Would recommend to others to work for Schwab.  Culture is somewhat relaxed.
good,"supportive environment to learn finance, especially if you want to do it ethically and according to IRS regulation."
good,"Understand the project requirements, current system architecture, follow the SDLC process and develop the target system as required. 	Prepare high and low level designs"
good,Key leaders within the organization make all of the difference between loving this place or running for the exits.
good,Good temp job. Left when the market crashed. Good work environement
good,"Multiple opportunities to show your skill set; frequent changes to organizational structure, really good people, multiple opportunities to volunteer and give back to the community; diverse, gay friendly and very supportive."
good,"This was a call center job so all day was spent on the phone helping customers solve problems with their equipment. I took extra classes and learned all about how to hook up just about anything to a T.V. Because I took those extra classes I was able to become a manager very quickly because I showed the incitive to work. The hardest part of the job was sitting all day and being able to hear the person next to you talk while you are trying to figure something out. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people that I worked with, we were so close that we would go out every weekend together and do things"
good,"Schwab is a organization that is consistently finding ways to lead the financial services industry with new products, tools, and resources.  Leadership is able to identify opportunities for growth with clients and through acquisitions as well."
good,"Schwab, and the leadership, did an excellent job allocating the time and resources to complete my contracted work within the year. In that time, I was able to write all content for the new Schwab Developer Portal and create excellent Swagger / OpenAPI contract files for their REST APIs."
good,"10/10 great environment 1/10 work/life balance"
good,My team was very concerned about my work/life balance. My manager always encouraged me to take the time off I needed for my family. Sick time and vacation accrue well.
good,Schwab has been a great place to start a career and obtain industry licenses.  The training program and study time that you are given to pass SIE and Series 7 is adequate for anyone who puts the time in.  It's up to you to steer your career and unless you apply yourself you won't advance your career.
good,"Strong culture focused on client"
good,"Great company.  An innovator in the industry and a pioneer into new product and service offerings that challenge the status quo, often resulting in competition having to adjust to Schwab’s lead"
good,Rewarding place if looking to advance with somewhere for a long period of time. Somewhat stressful environment due to being a new person and having something to prove.
good,"an overall good place to work with limited opportunities to advance."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,The branch employees were great.  Our branch manager was based out of Rochester and only came to our branch every couple weeks to check in with the employees.
good,I was laid off during the market down turn. Overall the benefits were great compare to other companies that I worked for. I enjoyed the time I was there.
good,"Data Analysis, SQL Development, Tableau Development - Executive Dashboards, standardized metric definitions - KPI development."
good,"It's been a good place to work at the last 20 years.  I am very impressed with the culture of the firm.  As the company footprint is decreasing in San Francisco, I  am looking for a change."
good,Fast paced environment.  Frequent changes in leadership and structure within departments.  Highly political. Open positions for hire require significant credentials in order to be a valid candidate.
good,"I do enjoy Schwab's workplace culture, Schwab holds true to their workplace culture and what it should represent. The employees are the best part of working at Schwab."
good,Schwab is a good place to work.  Friendly people too wrk with. Sometimes too much politics. Flexible work schedules in some departments. Had to get ahead if you don't play the game.
good,I wouldn't really have anything special to say about working at Schwab for their IT dept... It was a pretty standard 6month contract gig. They generally treated me well and the facilities and staff were nice. Unfortunately kept pretty separate from everyone else but otherwise no issues.
good,"I have nothing but good things to say about the culture with this employer.  The people are friendly and courteous from the top down.  They love to work and keep a magnificent focus on the customer.  They do strive to ""see through the customers eyes""."
good,The company overall seems to be a great place to work but there are some issues.  The pay is a bit low especially for the work load.  Upper management is never around and it seems as if everybody is just a number rather than a person.
good,"Very good people throughout Schwab.  Talented, professional and hardworking. Solid spirit of cooperation through the whole chain of command. You can do your best work at Schwab."
good,"I've worked twice for Charles Schwab now and wouldn't mind going back.  The company like other big companies has its week points. Training is a low point in the areas that I worked but only because what one would be dealing with was so broad at times there wasn't any easy way to train a person. I think Schwab could invest some more time, rather than a throw you in the river and see if you can swim type of approach.  Be that as it may, you will probably be overwhelmed for a while and that can cause stress. But the managers are usually as helpful and supportive as they can be, at least where I worked. Schwab does have a culture that DOES react to change and suggestions from within. I've seen it. Plus they are diverse, and the pay is very good, even with the possibility of getting bonuses in some departments. "
good,It was a great place for me to use to get into my next gig. The recruiting team I worked with was quick and diligent in getting me in front of the client at a rate above my expectations.
good,Working here made me learn alot. Very interesting place to work where the managers were also like a part of the team helping out all the times with all they got.
good,Strong client orientation is one of the best reasons to work here.  Employment and growth opportunities in San Francisco are limited as company continues to move employees to CO and TX.
good,"I liked it but I worked on the bank side and all of the advancement and opportunities seemed to be on the broker side. The pay was decent for bank, it was a lot better for brokers. I thought I needed a finance or related degree to go on the broker side. When I was in training (the same training the brokers get except for the last 3 days) I found out that I was educated to a higher level than most of the broker side. They also had an assortment of degrees, not just finance related. Their pay was $5k higher than mine at start."
good,It is a demanding environment and if it were easy everyone would be doing.  The people you work with are the key to success and enjoying the day to day grind.
good,Charles Schwab does an excellent job of providing a flexible environment with an emphasis on work/life balance.  My coworkers are very professional and fun to work with.
good,"Charles Swab was a temporary job, I was only allow to learn certain level of the business. I enjoyed working there. Management was great. Co-worker was very helpful."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"Smart company with lots of room to grow your career. Decent salaries but they mess with your variable comp from year to year. "
good,"Assisted participant(client) develop retirement plan and solid fundamentals in saving money for retirement, goals and emergencies."
good,"The best time to work at this company was in the early 1990's because there was a lot of creativity and forward movement given the advent of the dot com era. Work life balance was greatly valued and employees were encourage to explore their talents and goals,"
good,Day consists of doing alerts and nothing else. Learned a lot about the banking and brokerage industry.
good,"Positive, young, and fast paced work environment. Great training"
good,Management needs to encourage employees to be the same where it serves the public and shareholders best interests.
good,Good environment to learn about financial services industry.
good,"Great culture along with benefits.  Diversity was a big plus, and they activity seek a diverse workforce.  Negative like all organizations your experience could be driven by your manager.  The seem to have a had time recruiting and retaining talented management.  The value and vision are so strong that am not sure what leads to this weakness.   I will tell you the grass is not greener at Fidelity along with true addition of a good old boy club."
good,"If you don't work over time you will never get advanced. They tell you that overtime is not ""required"" because it is illegal for them to tell you that, but it is highly ""recommended""."
good,"Great place for growth. Fun company to get you started. Compensation doesn’t compare to its competitors. Overall, great place. Benefits could be better."
good,"Pass your Series 7, and work hard and you can have a job for a long time. Great benefits, flexible hours, and good career path. Must enjoy talking on the phone. Only problem is salary and bonuses are too low for the industry."
good,"At Schwab, every 5 years you got a sabbatical (28 days of paid vacation time to do whatever you want). People stayed at Schwab for so long, after a while, you started assessing how long someone had been at Schwab based on the number of sabbaticals they had taken and not years. It was not uncommon to meet someone who was at their third or fourth sabbatical."
good,"I think Charles Schwab is a great organization, the pay is good and the benefits are awesome.  They build these huge campuses and want people to be on them, it would be better to save some $$ and have a greater commitment to work life balance.  I appreciate my management team, very supportive and encouraging."
good,"In my 4-year experience with the firm, I have had ups and lows. Overall, this is a good company to be and to develop your skills in. Regular 8-5, sales-incentivized, emphasis on connecting with clients and engaging them actively. Benefits and salary are comparable for the industry. The firm's mission flows through it - to see through client's eyes and do the right thing by them. Some of the cons are heavy sales incentives, difficulty to progress, some disengaged managers. I would overall recommend the firm to new hires."
good,"The company has some wonderful values and beliefs and it can really make the big vision it strides for. In order to get there, leadership and management needs to trust in people, don't be afraid of change, let employees collaborate with one another, embrace ideas and primarily practice what you preach."
good,Charles Schwab is  a great workplace to grow your career. Learn new skills. I had a great time there. The people are very supportive. You can learn a lot.
good,"Culture has changed considerably since the dot.com era. A number of geospatial moves out of San Francisco HQs has folks on pins and needles. "
good,"Schwab takes pride in their product and services.  "
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"Schwab seems to have two different cultures...those veteran employees that are in love with the company and legacy of industry Titan and revolutionary Charles Schwab...and those of us brought in under the new guard of upper management that treats it's employees like cogs and is desperate to outsource and quick to build feifdoms at the expense of knowledge retention, loyalty, career advancement and overall workplace satisfaction."
good,"Wonderful opportunity to get into financial services. Will pay to get your licenses and time to study. My advice would be to leave upon licensing however. For whatever reason, Schwab loves to hire outside."
good,Talented employees. Purpose-driven company and enriching workplace culture.  A very ethical company that focuses on providing high-quality service and products for its clients and prospects.
good,"Great corporate culture, but difficult to move outside your immediate department for opportunities. Client-first focus allows employees to do what's best for clients."
good,"Charles Schwab provide excellent benefits, has good life/work balance. There is an education/learning opportunities, comfortable work environment, cafeteria onsite and free parking.  There is a discount program promoting healthy lifestyle and supporting childcare."
good,There was uncertainty about where the project was going and many people were wondering what the future would hold.  There was reduced information provided to contractors as opposed to full-time employees.
good,"Typical day of work is managing 12+ representatives, ensuring they provide quality services to RIA end clients. In this job you learn a lot about people and their personalities, how to motivate and keep employees engaged. The work place culture is good but stressful.  The hardest part of this job is that you can be pulled apart in many directions daily as we tend to be severely understaffed as the company grows. The most enjoyable part of this job is watching reps grow in their lives and in their careers."
good,"Daily deadlines and coordinated client support among team members."
good,The company in itself is a good company to work for however there is a lot of pressure and the management is some of the worst I have had- this is just speaking in regards to the operations center. I do recommend it if you like pressure because they do pay well and have good benefits. For someone that is more active and doesn't like a sitting all day job- look elsewhere.
good,Relax place to work. I had a lot of fun. Benefit at the company was very good and the company made sure they took care of us after my job was relocated.
good,"Good culture, hard to move up or to other positions. Lots of lay offs in San Francisco. Pays well,  good benefits, close to public transport. Job uncertainty."
good,"I worked with Investment Advisors at multiple firms cultivating relationships and helping them succeed for their end clients goal. My team was an amazing group to work with. We went through three managers, however, and the last is no longer in his position or that dept. due to his lack of leadership and developing the team. The team has recently lost 5 of the original 9 on the team; most have decided to leave Schwab due to the lack of management."
good,"This is a great company with good people, compensation, benefits, brand reputation and more. I was a contractor so it was temporary which is why I moved on."
good,They just don't pay their full time employees very well compared to contractors - who get paid market wages.  Great campus (Lonetree) very good benefits for full time employees.
good,Fast passed environment - I've learned to motivate individuals to meet their 6 months and 12 months goals.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great group of people.
good,Not much too say.  Company benefits are very good.  Great products and reputation.  Culture is pretty good.  Work / Life balance is excellent.  Only negative tends to be they get sidetracked easy in management and objectives.
good,The workload in managed accounts was consistent most days and heavy on others.  Team mates pitched in to help and the environment was very team oriented.
good,I grew from being a Trainee CSE to Asst Unit Manager. There were lot of support and training opportunities being provided to grow ourselves. Lots of freedom is given to experiment or take our own decisions.
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,I've enjoyed working here. the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Training is made easy to understand while keeping up with the everyday changes in the financial industry.
good,I like the company. They provide opportunities for growth and management.  Management is very on top of things and very attentive to all employees. Overall I like it
good,"nice culture, advancement is limited, on site cafeteria, old building, great brand recognition, nice community participation with volunteer day, ancillary benefits are good."
good,Charles Schwab is a company that cares about its employees and the growth of their careers. Management and leadership are more than happy to help you pursue whatever career path you may have within the company. This company is more than willing to invest its resources in you because they understand the value of employee retention.
good,Its a great place to work and with a moderate opportunity to grow within your own department. Must wait 18 months before you can apply for advancement or other department opportunities.
good,"Schwab was a great company to work for.  I worked there for three years and learned a great deal about working in the corporate environment, working with well established/large clients, and maintaining relationships through hard work and the building of trust."
good,"•	Position requires knowledge non – CNS transactions with other broker dealers through various depositories and cleaning organization."
good,"A typical day is filled with unexpected surprises."
good,Great Place - but working through SDLC across functional areas
good,"I originally applied and got a job for one position, they for whatever reason, I was put into another position that I didn't apply for. It wasn't horrible and I needed a job, but it was a disappointing experience."
good,"Relaxing and comfortable environment."
good,Well run shop. Not the same since Chuck turned it early in early 2000.
good,Managed team of data analysts to support data needs for internal group.  Managed large and small projects to improve data infrastructure and improve processes.
good,"loved my co-workers.  took care of each other.  if there hadn't been layoffs, especially after 9/11, would probably still be working there"
good,"It has not been like it was when I was there for while, but when I was, it was great.  You do your job well and they reward you for it.  They do a good job at acknowledging success and rewarding it."
good,"Pros:"
good,"I commute via BART and arrive about 45 minutes early. I open the safe, print clients' checks for the day and open the branch. I assist clients at the front desk with check and stock certificate deposits and operational problems as well as financial consultants with any problems they have, ie. submitting paperwork, compiling information, or any other miscellaneous tasks. I talk with clients and prospects about Schwab products, looking for sales opportunities. If there is a financial workshop scheduled for the day, I may present myself or coordinate another presenter. At the end of day, I print reports of the day's activities and close the branch."
good,"Schwab is a great place to work with an excellent corporate culture. Most at Schwab understand that people have personal lives and will accommodate for that, so long as you have your responsibilities covered. The general atmosphere is fairly laid back, which means that as an employee you have to take the initiative frequently. In IT, they haven't figured out how to promote lower level employees. This is because they hire in many employees at the senior staff level, which results in the company being quite top-heavy. There is no defined criteria in IT land for promotion and it often seems to be at management's whim. However, as long as you perform well, job security is almost ensured, barring unusual circumstances."
good,Good company to work for.  The work place culture is unique. They don't pay as much as other firms but provide other benefits that can make up for it.
good,"Charles Schwab was a fast paced in bound call center but every call was unique, every client was unique. Even though you don't see the client face to face, to still feel a connection with the client and knowing you helped them better understand what retirement could potentially do for them, is a win."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"Always something new to learn, good work culture.  Stable company that is growing and many different areas where there are opportunities to learn.  5 major campus' around the country"
good,"You won't find better work-life balance in the finance industry.  For example, I only work 3 days a week and just work 12 hour days.  On the downside, Schwab pays lower than industry average and moving around within the company can be challenging.  When you are working the phones as a broker, your only options are pretty much to move up to a more specialized phone team.   Working your way out of the call center is challenging."
good,Great benefits. Good culture. Great job out of college and easy to get licensed. People really pride themselves in their work and what they do on a day to day basis
good,"At least for me, metrics were difficult to achieve because of the additional roles I had taken on. I didn't feel the metrics were properly adjusted for the extra work I put in."
good,Ability to learn about industry with great access to several departments. A lot of the work at Schwab is call center related and you must stay disciplined if you are looking for career advancement within.
good,"Good to work here, manager respect you, life and work are balanced, coworkers are nice, not too much pressure. Working enviroment is friendly, I would like to go back."
good,"I enjoy working here at Schwab, but I do feel there is room for improvements. Pay for the lower grades is definitely a must, working with some managers is another. All in all great company with great benefits."
good,"Schwab Institutional, now known as Advisor Services, supports independent Registered Investment Advisors with trade support, operational support. They do a very good job of providing sales and operational support to the Advisors."
good,"charles schwab is a greta company, but it is focused on customer service and not on performing a service for the client. the sertvices offerred by schwab are done through other parties"
good,"Schwab is a good place to get started. The job training is excellent. The best training is the ""Build a Broker"" program. Basically, you go to school for a few months in a classroom like setting to be a stock broker. You must pass the Series 7/65 to qualify."
good,It's a great place to work even better if you fit the culture. Most the people are accepting and good people to be work around. They are for the customer company.
good,Schwab is a client-focused firm with decent vision and management culture.The firm focused extensively on cost reduction after the crash of '08 so it has fallen behind competitors in terms of its offer and infrastructure however.
good,"Schwab has so many different paths for career development, and most areas are very responsive to furthering career growth and progression. Lots of support and they are very focused on building a diverse pool of talent."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Schwab. Excellent culture, very collaborative. You will receive a lot of support from your team and business partners across the firm. Management is really focused on having you progress within the company. Very competent coworkers. It was a high-stress environment as I worked in the department that responds to all written complaints and verbal grievances."
good,"Enjoyed my time at Schwab.  "
good,"If your not a broker or intend to be a broker you will get stuck easily.  I worked on the bank side for 4 years, as a POC and Fraud specialist.  Regardless of being great at my job, its hard to get anywhere if series 7 is not attained.  Schwab is mainly a brokerage firm a bank second."
good,My review here is limited as I worked as a Contractor.   The people here are very friendly and helpful.  The facilities are very nice.   I was allowed to work flexible hours (based on my manager).
good,"No specific review provided in this section.  A general review in the ""Rate this company"" section should provide an appropriate level of insight on my opinions about the firm."
good,"Maintain and support security data for brokerage system, work with vendor, business and technical partners.  "
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,A typical day at work would be verifying clients identity with respect to the US Patriot Act and Anti-Money Laundering laws. There are an influx of new accounts being opened daily so there is a need to work quickly and efficiently in order to clear out the days work in addition to answering client calls in response to identity verification and being of assistance to other departments to clear account restrictions. The work culture is very friendly and inviting leaning on your peers for assistance with accounts. The most enjoyable part of the job is you being empowered to make judgment calls surrounding suspicious account opens and potential fraud where you may need to close down the account and report suspicious fraud.
good,"Great place to work.  The IT team I worked with were great  I would of been happy to stay, however, they started their outsourcing process to all of their IT.  Great fours year though, thanks Schwab."
good,Work schedule seemed quite rigid. The testing for the licensing was very challenging. Position was sedentary. Fellow co-workers and management were great.
good,"The company is really great. You get to choose your hours, the co-workers are extremely friendly and they always make you feel like a family. They have opportunity for advancement."
good,"At the time, I advanced from mail-room to receptionist in 4 months. got to know 1500 employees in the building since I had many tasks for the facilities department, where I worked. But it was a joyful area and so much fun."
good,"Good company to work for.  Great benefits."
good,Unfortunately the pay and benefits no longer outweigh the 'cya' attitude and lack of team work.  If you're in Technical Support stay in Technology department otherwise there is no room for advancement unless you're a developer. 7 years ago I use to LOVE working at Schwab.  Now it's all I can do to drag myself to work.  Very sad.
good,"They train well, but can get burned out easily, high turnover in the call center. Advancement is difficult unless you have the right manager, but opportunities are available to those who work at it."
good,"Great company however,  it is almost impossible to move into higher positions if you don't know people. My personal experience is that when jobs are advertised, it always goes to the favorites. It is not what you know, or how hardworking and diligent you are. You may remain in the same position forever even when you have acquired additional education, licences or skills. It is really unfortunate. "
good,Charles Schwab is a good place to work especially if you are starting out in financial services.    They are in multiple locations and have over 300 branches across the United States so many opportunities to move around.  The culture is collaborative and fun most of the time.   You can also experience very busy periods especially during market hours and tax season
good,"Clients come first, company's core competencies revolve around doing what is right for each client. Good culture, promotes professionalism. Management is supportive and are interested in individual personal growth/ development while also keeping productivity at its best."
good,"Schwab is a good place to work because it provides a lot of education and opportunities for advancement.  The initial customer service floor is hard work.  The schedule is tightly managed.  If you can make it past the initial CSR position, you will be in a good position.  The company utilizes your strengths and talents to their advantage.  The do pay on the low side in the financial industry."
good,The company has a great culture and they show appreciation to their employees often. The company offers many options you just have to pass mandatory licensing test to advance which could take a lot of time.
good,Highly productive work environment in a very specialized roll. Managing relationship between high net worth Investment Advisors and Schwab. Great camaraderie with co-workers.
good,"Great work environment."
good,The company really takes care of their employees I like the atmosphere. The company is also a great company to hold your assets.
good,"This is a good place to work, but a tough place to get things accomplished promoted.  Work life balance is very good, stress levels are moderate, and sense of urgency is pretty low."
good,Licensing exams are very difficult and there is no training program to help you pass them. The culture is great and the people are great.
good,Charles Schwab offers competitive pay and growth opportunity.  They offer continued training as it relates to my current and future position.  CS believes in investing in their employees and helps them to feel appreciated and valued as an employee.
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"A great place to start out of college to decide where you want to go in life. Even if you stay here you will have job security and opportunity for advancement and pay. If you're into good work culture, this place is pretty happy overall."
good,"I was hired through a recruiting firm for a seasonal position."
good,"Overall I think Charles Schwab is a good place to work.  I worked as a Registered Representative in the call center in Indianapolis.  The pay is $40,000. per year plus the opportunity to work overtime during the tax season and various other times when call volumes are high.  They provide quality training on cashiering, placing stock trades, basic option trades and basic market information.  The training helped me feel comfortable providing customer service on the phone.  I did not enjoy the job however.  The customers really annoyed me; many would call requesting password resets or they would have me place simple trades for them (costing them $33.95).  They could place the same trade on the website in mere seconds for only $8.95 (Usually old people stubborn in their ways).  Of the 30-70 calls per day, roughly 10 to 20% of calls on any given day would include customers railing on Obama, espousing the virtues of Reaganomics, hating on Kramer, or claiming that ""you guys,"" are cheating me out of my dividends!  Just not the type of work I am passionate about but I did get my Series 7 and 63 so I guess that is something...I may never use it but...If I were a betting man (and I guess I am) I would think that jobs like reps in a call center would become increasingly automated as companies try in earnest to become as efficient as possible and at the same time provide excellent customer service and bringing in as many client assets as humanly and robotically possible.  The truth is in the details and the optimum formula is likely a never ending pursuit.  That's all folks!!!"
good,Interesting and exciting work environment. I enjoyed going to work every day
good,I was only there in a temp position so I don't really have much to say.  They did take care of their full time employees.
good,"Great culture.  Lots of smart people.  Schwab is the first company I've worked for where it seemed like they actually cared about me.  Fantastic benefits, good work life balance.  They let developers do what developers do best."
good,"- Company is unique for a financial services company. They generally care about their clients and that is reflected in the company culture"
good,"Great company, truly values work life balance. Their Value Proposition for everyday retail investors is second to none. Their institutional business still need development."
good,"Flexible schedules for work/life balance"
good,"A typical day at work was extremely busy. I learned accounts receivable and how a business office needs to be run. "
good,"A great place to help clients that need assistance with reaching their goals."
good,"Easy job: low stress, low pay, low chances for any real promotion."
good,"I liked the people I was around and the manager's were helpful and willing to back their employees. Training was in-depth although it was over a very large sum of information. I was in a call center position and did not enjoy my role. Advancement is available after a minimum of one and half years on the front line phone lines, and then it was not guaranteed to get off the phones. Great company, position was not for me."
good,"It offers the opportunity to work with clients, consultants and back office personnel. It has a good corporate culture and is involved in the community. They emphasize high ethical standards."
good,Great focus on clients and good culture.  Benefits include a sabbatical every five years and time to volunteer. Growing company with opportunities for advancement.
good,Flexible work environment and learned many new technologies and gained hands-on experience and improved the skills that would help me survive in the job market.
good,Going through a lot of change at the company in 2019. Should settle down into 2020 but new leadership is changing the way work gets done. Providing a lot of training for the digital transformation.
good,"Great onboarding, continued education, and internal promotion makes Schwab a great place to work. Good senior leadership and direction in the financial world."
good,My experience at Schwab is excellent. I have learned a lot about the industry and how to deliver unparalleled customer service which I will keep with me always. I am at a point in my career where I am looking to continue to grow and advance my skills as an advisor and I just feel I am moving too slowly in my current position.
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,Great place to work. Management has been great but like any place there are learning managers who impact work environment. Pay is typically on the lower end compared to other financial institutions
good,I enjoyed working at Charles Schwab. I’ve worked for various managers. 8 out of 10 were excellent. Culture of growth. There was a time many years ago of massive lay offs and out of state transfers but I think that is over.  I would go back.
good,Charles Schwab is a great place to enter the financial industry. They have a good training  program for new employees. They provide many opportunities for upward movement. Very good benefits as well.
good,"There is a very specific culture at Schwab that I did not fit into. "
good,"Growing company with a positive outlook and future. Work/Life balance, benefits & culture are the best reasons to work for Charles Schwab, Branch or Call Center both upward mobility lateral moves within the company can be limited."
good,"Good proximity to transit, excellent work environment, growing presence in the region. I think the thing I like most is everyone is helpful while navigating the firm"
good,Would recommend to anyone wanting a good company with decent benefits. great products for the clients and very competitively priced so clients want to do business with Schwab.
good,"Schwab is a solid company to work for long term.  They have great benefits and the culture is one of the best in the industry.  The biggest down side is the starting salaries in departments.  Other companies pay more, but you can work your way up to good compensation.  "
good,The product that was being sold was a benefit to the clients to time was difficult since September 11th occurred while working and caused business to dry up
good,"Good place to start or move a career forward, they are a fast paced firm, looking to assist their clients,. They are a client centric firm, with expense savings and efficiency a goal."
good,management is very good at all and it is most enjoyable to do the work in the workplace moreover it is possible to work in extra hours and it is very happy to work over there.
good,"Assisted Schwann clients that called in with respect to all trading and customer service issues ."
good,Charles Schwab has great people and a comfortable environment with a good work life balance. Working in technology there is very 'reactive' to business needs and you don't always have the autonomy and time to innovate where and how you'd like to as a technology team.
good,"Good company overall, pay can be good depending on the department you are in. Company offers sabbaticals every 5 years (4 weeks) and you get money for your HSA every year."
good,Work culture was the most difficult because they do not treat contractors as employees. It is said because of legal issues and protection of the company and the contractor
good,"Schwab is a great place to work for people that are either new to the financial services field, or experienced. There is a huge emphasis on the client, and our vision to see all things through client's eyes is a fundamental fact of all that the company does."
good,"I worked at Schwab during the early part of my career, I thought it was a great place to learn and build up experience. I had the opportunity to be involved in a wide variety of projects and initiatives and got lots of varied experience. It's been years since I have worked there and I know the organization has gone through a significant amount of change, but I liked the company and its culture during my time."
good,"Haven't been working for Charles Schwab long. It isn't the best fit for me personally, but many others really love it! Do your research first to be sure it's something you want to do."
good,"I loved working at Schwab, and especially enjoyed working with my manager. She was flexible and understanding. The company has a focused mission and means to achieve goals. It is a structured, and enjoyable place to be."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"Charles Schwab is a good, strong company that promotes from within its ranks.  You can easily switch departments or do something new.  The people who work at Schwab are incredible.  "
good,"If you're looking to retire its a good place to work. I enjoyed most of what I do, however some misunderstanding with management and how code should be done cause a conflict."
good,"Depending on your department, you will learn a lot! I have learned a ton about finance and retirement accounts, which I knew nothing about to start. There are a lot of phone calls that come in and you need to be able to handle frantic and frustrated clients, especially during year end and tax season."
good,"Schwab is a great company to work for, the only thing to keep in mind that in order to advance you MUST be licensed or you will remain stuck in your department/"
good,Worked with more than 8000 Business Users and never gets demotivated. Employee friendly and sage place to work without any problems with management. Good place to work
good,"Probably the best corporate culture I've worked in in a couple decades. Can't speak for the whole company, but the Austin side where I worked was staffed by folks who wanted to work there and worked hard to do their bit. Two folks I knew were slackers weren't there within six months of my coming there."
good,"Charles Schwab was not a bad place to work.  They compensate employees very well, and training is very adequate to make a person succeed there.  Direct Managers and Assistant Managers are chosen very well, and usually do a great job.  However, if you would like to advance your career it can be quite fought and cut throat."
good,"The amazing people, the culture, the food, the beautiful office space, complete work life balance, and the number of career advancement opportunities is second to none. Company has a great culture- generous benefits, high integrity management, no jerks allowed to be hired. Not your typical greed-driven Wall Street environment for the financial industry. They are innovative in their market space and try to do the right thing for investors. They are a well run company with strong financials and good growth prospects. They allow employees to spend volunteer time working at local nonprofits, and they have a company matching donation program."
good,Great company.  Feel Schwab is the best Broker/Dealer.  Felt I needed to move on from the business model.  The job description and position responsibilities changed dramatically after the first 5.5 months in my Financial Consultant role and again after 3.5 months of taking the Investment Consultant role.
good,CS is a great place to work with great people and a wonderful work-life balance. The day is primarily pushing code and troubleshooting performance issues.
good,"Great place to work and advance, management really cares about people. If you’re driven, hard-working, and a good manager of time this will be a great place to springboard your career."
good,"Busy days which include responsibilities to promote client retention and identify opportunities to build existing relationships through timely and accurate operational processing and service quality."
good,"Schwab is consistently rated as a top employer to work for. The company thrives on providing value to both it's clients and shareholders. While there is a strong culture established from the top down that can be felt as soon as you walk through the doors, their consistent distribution of profits back to the shareholders results in a conservative pool of retained earnings for infrastructure development and employee compensation potential. This is a company that will allow you to create what you want for yourself and support you along the way, but may fall short when it comes to compensation for that growth relative to other firms."
good,"Good pay and work environment is nice. There is favoritism and they want to get as much work from one person as possible, but that's commonplace nowadays with any company."
good,"As a consultant, it is great, I cannot speak for FTE roles or to compensation/benefits. "
good,It is good company to work. You will get a lot technical exposure here. Work life balance is good for full time employment but not for offshore contractors.
good,Okay place to work. Very robotic having to take call after call with very limited breaks. Not healthy to stare in front of a computer monitor for 8 plus hours a day.
good,Schwab is a great place to work and I wish I was still there.  High amount of integrity both with the clientele and the employees.  The training was excellent and I was exposed to a lot of areas.
good,Everyone was welcoming and encouraging even though my teammates and I were on a temporary job. I was given my own work space and it was the largest office I've ever been assigned for any position and this was for a temporary role. IT was very helpful.
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties.

good,Schwab is a good company to work for.  Mine were call center positions which come with the stresses and frustrations of customer service work.  Staff and management were collaborative and supportive.
good,"I found Schwab to be a good place to work,  I was there on a contract which was extended.  the pace is moderate, their technology can be a little behind, as well they are not fast to change."
good,My day starts with preparing reports to be used for the daily review. It takes organization and responsibility to make sure monthly goals are meant. The job and it's requirements are constantly changing as is the methods needed to complete the goals.  The company is client satisfaction oriented.but sometimes forgets the stress the constant changing puts on its representatives. This is the hardest part of the job. The enjoyable part is teaching the new hires as well as the experienced reps how to read and use the tools provided to  make the client experience as good as possible.

I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"This scheduling position was new.  So as it developed, I wrote the position description and instruction manual. My supervisor was patient and kind as I struggled to teach myself and become involved in the network processes, which was more than I was required to do.  I mastered updating tickets in Remedy.  I created reports on daily network progress. The techs I supported were great; and I enjoyed giving well-received input for the design of a new scheduling software.  My supervisor was not able to keep me when the contract ended.  Upper management decided to release all contractors after a rough year of constant market crashes.  I only give 4 stars for overall rating because I wanted to be hired into the position.  It just couldn't be done."

good,"Asset manager with ambitious growth objectives.  Significant effort toward improving the support infrastructure, but not quite there yet.  Overall a pleasant work environment that may or may not allow for advancement depending on the job track.  Some career paths are more clear cut than others.  Ethical firm."

good,Charles Schwab was a great place to work. Most of my managers and directors were very competent and always willing to listen and take suggestions. It was very much a team like atmosphere in all the departments I worked in. Anytime an issue arose someone was willing to help resolve it quickly for the clients. The workplace culture is like none that I have ever been a part of and it is truly a family there. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping clients find an answer to their problems. The only issue I had is that they seemed to reward people more for their time at the company and not so much what you contributed.

good,I had an amazing experience as part of the first FC Academy Cohort in Phoenix. The call center can sometimes be very political and hectic. Managers are hit or miss. The training you receive is adequate. Charles Schwab loves to promote from within and loves to focus on career advancement which is great.
good,The finance industry can be a very intense place to work. The people there are great but the expectations can be high. The most enjoyable part were the people I worked with. I did not like the industry and type of work I was doing.

good,"Overall Schwab is a great company! they really care about their employees and clients. They do need to be more mindful of the management they choose because some of them do not uphold Schwab,s values and they are the ones that get to choose who and how quick they want to ""promote"" people. Unfair really."
good,"At Schwab, everyone I have met has been warm, friendly and supportive. We have a strong collaborative culture where employees and clients really matter. Our manager has an open-door policy and has been a wonderful mentor and coach. The most enjoyable part of my job are the positive relationships I have with my manager and my colleagues.

good,"This was a wonderful opportunity. I grew from Risk Coordinator to Director-BCP at corporate level."

Very relaxed atmosphere. Friendly professional co-workers. The hardest part of the job is making sure to cover all trade restrictions and precise processing information as each company 401K plan is plan specific. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting and educating each participant without pressure and feeling good about giving your best to help someone else and hearing that participant say, ""thank you, you've been a big help, I understand now and can make a better choice based on what I've learned today."""

good,"The interaction with the clients was really enjoyable. I learned so much while I was there and passed the Series 7 and 63 exams, which was a requirement. Unfortunately, there were certain co-workers that behaved in childish ways that made life a bit miserable at times. Of course, these individuals acted much differently when the manager was around."
good,Typical work day is usually 8-6 fast paced work enviorment. You must be quick on your feet and eager to learn. Management is very straight forward and expects you to know things you must take initiative in order to move up. Coworkers are nice and willing to help you. Hardest part of the job is not having many positions available in all depts in order to move up. Everyday is a surprise. Nothing is ever dull

A manager with a great ability to manage her workers knowing when to give special attention to those who need it and when to give space to those who work well on their own.   The hardest part of the job is taking on too many issues which go beyond my given ability to multi-task.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing how I can make a difference by having a positive influence on my co-workers on a daily basis.  I have a likeable personality and I bring out the good in my coworkers which in turn creates a stronger bond among us all for a better and more productive working environment.

good,A typical day at work is not filled with overwhelming stress and pressure. The leadership is understanding and works with the employees to get the overall goal accomplished.
good,"Most of time, I matched Schwab clientele addresses and entered their changes into Schwab mail merging program."
good,Schwab was an exciting and fast paced enviroment with amazing culture and history
good,I loved learning something new each day. They really put a great emphasis on making sure people minimize risk and provide great customer service. Great place to work!
good,"Great company and an even better culture, but you run very lean. There is never a shortage of work to do and lots of pressure to produce a larger number of AUM each year. It's a good balance between working hard/smart and producing at a level that helps your market and company help the bottom line of the firm."
good,"Enjoy the work life balance."
good,Schwab is a great place to work.  There is a strong culture that values doing the right thing for both employees and clients.  Management is really involved and strives to help engage employees and help them grow.
good,I worked as a contractor  - Charles Schwab hires many contractors. Working as a contractor does not easily turn into a full time job offer. Culture is great at the Lone Tree campus
good,"They were strict about some things, can't smoke on the property, can't park in valet on the weekends, etc.  But then in other ways they were relaxed about stuff like the training.  You learn a lot but when training is done, it is very slow paced starting out.  They do have great benefits and great pay for full time agents but I was a contractor."
good,Schwab is a great company to work for.  Enjoyed my employment there while it lasted. Enjoyed the location of the office and we had alot of social events through out the the year.
good,"a typical day was sitting at a cubical staring at a computer all day, using multiple software and had to be very attentive, organized and work closely with colleague to meet all deadlines for the day. it was a great place to work at the company shows they really care about there employees and clients. the promote health and wellbeing, always doing things for employees to make life  easier and just to show they care. its a really cool place to work at if you like  an office environment. there was always something new to learn and the benefits provided are wonderful. everything there in trained in house since they have there own system they work with, class are also available to become license, Over all it was a great place to work at. just depends on if that's your type of job."
good,"Although I am no longer with Charles Schwab & Co., I consider them a great custodian of customer's assets. The leadership of the firm is working to enhance leadership succession and employee engagement."
good,"Fun professional environment, fast paced, use a lot of contractors though and you never know if there's going to be layoffs due to the market. Some managers are great."
good,Charles Schwab is a great company to work for. Schwab is great for work/life balance. Compensation and benefits could definitely be better. Schwab is a great place for someone who is looking for job security.
good,"Was a good place to work. "
good,"Great place to work.  You must be able to handle constant change, which is the norm at any large company.  Fantastic CEO and the founder is still heavily involved in providing guidance."
good,"Great company with solid culture. Several opportunities and management seems to really care about employees."
good,"There are a few deadlines, but am always able to meet them.  Work with excel, word, access, and other internal reconciliation systems.  I send various reports to other departments identifying all out of balance situations.  I enjoy learning new things about the investment world."
good,"Fast paced environment, on site cafeteria more than made up for the pace."
good,"Charles Schwab had a great community of professionals to work with. Unfortunately, they do not have career path options to get to each area within the company. For example, I am interested in equity research and they only hire people with outside experience for those positions."
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"Charles Schwab is a great company to work for, unless you are in a call center. It amazes me how many other departments do not even know about CS&S even though it is the largest department at Schwab. It is hard to get a job in a different department when you start in the call center,"
good,I was a contractor here for 18 months and enjoyed it very much. I was given good direction on the nature and expected results of the project and was given plenty of leeway to accomplish it. Personnel in the San Francisco office and in the outside regions were cooperative in providing information and wanting to see the project succeed. Not a lot of the petty office politics. Included in most office events. Friendly and professional office atmosphere. An all around excellent experience.
good,"Excellent place to work for with great benefits and pay.  Great team working environment.  High values, ethics, culture and opportunity to work with corporate executives and officers."
good,"Charles Schwab has a good reputation in the investing community for a reason: The broker offers high-quality customer service, competitive trade commissions and a large selection of commission-free ETFs and no-transaction-fee mutual funds."
good,"work life balance is nice but you may be required to work evening events, but those events typically include free good work and sometimes drinks. comp is not great considering what is required of you and compared to the industry. advancement can be hit or miss."
good,"Great company, lots of educated well rounded employees. Management offers classes opportunities to advance as well as educate employees for future advancement."
good,"Charles Schwab is a good place. A traditional brokerage company, with nice people working here. The organization is quite hierarchy."
good,"I was only at Schwab for a year, so I have limited experience for an adequate review. It was my first job out of College, so when they relocated my department from San Francisco to Denver, I moved with them."
good,Managed and distributed digital images from a variety of sources. Trained college interns on the computer programs used to solve clients issues.
good,"At charles schwab  I made lifetime friends and learned a lot. Great place to work, unfortunately they subcontracted their accounts payble."
good,Finished a four month contract in one month. A team of contractors were skilled and very knowledgeable. Management was impressed with the talent
good,Very professional and great work environment. I would give anything to get rehired in this firm.
good,"My typical day is working in Flash, HTML, CSS, Jquery with a very knowledgeable team. I have learned how to work within multiple CMS systems and how to build flash for those CMS systems. The team is very helpful, collaborative, and just awesomely friendly."
good,"My experience at Charles Schwab and Co , Inc., was interesting, and meaningful.  I collaborated with training associates, sharing my insight with margin accounts trading and balance reasoning.  I also lead  training teams that would received the required details; I would organize, create a plan, and deliver and intended."
good,Great place to work. The company culture is outstanding and unlimited growth potential. Charles Schwab holds itself to a higher standard and is echoed throughout the company.
good,Brought in as a contractor. Only minus is they were very vague. To be hired on you do have to have less than $10000 in debt no matter what you hear contrary
good,"Great focus on delivering value-added services to clients."
good,Overall positive atmosphere. Lots of advancement opportunties.  Hard to maintain work/life balance with 24 hour staffing.  Culture is integral patt of company.
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"I think this is the best firm to work for if you want to break into the retail side of finance. They will help build you up, and teach you how to care about the client more than anything else."
good,"The customer call center allows no margin for error.  You answer 60 to 80 calls per shift covering everything from sending a client a check, helping them place trades and resetting passwords."
good,"Great place to work, great environment, great work life balance. I was working in the call center portion and although the work is repetitive the environment is light and supportive."
good,This is a nice place to work with nice collages and fun with the team. Working here is peaceful with spending 8 hours per day is good enough. I learned coordination with offshore team here in Charles schwab.
good,"This was always going to be a short contract position. However, the management and peers made me feel like a member of the team from day one."
good,"Great place to work, lots of good solid people who understand work life balance. Work is always interesting. Management is genrally good, but slow on uptake of new technologies"
good,"Relaxed and friendly setting coworkers helped each other willingly."
good,"excellent culture - employees treated with lots of respect; extremely strong client focus - always focussed on what's right for the clients; excellent executives, great benefits"
good,"Everyone goes about doing their business, very involved, multiple projects, fast paced and fun plce if you enjoy working hard"
good,The company invests in training and encorages people to be proactive toward making their job into a career. It is great to see that they talk the talk and walk the walk. They care about their employees and customers.
good,This company is a fantastic entry level to the finance world/. Management is top notch. You will learn quite a bit in the time with them. Dont stay to long though. They rarely move people up. If they do not move you up after a year and a half take your licences  and peace out!
good,"Excellent employer with a lot to offer. "
good,"Very client focused."
good,"The small segment of Schwab in which I worked had an entrepreneurial spirit that was especially fast paced and rewarding.  Overall, the company was strongly committed to providing benefits to employees that supported work/life balance."
good,"I worked with Facilities Management as the Admin Assist to the Lease Administration group part time.  On a typical day, I would receive and log legal documents from Landlords and then forward to the legal department for completion.  Once complete, the documents were sent back to the Landlord within the specified time limit.  I disliked this part of the job the most.  It could be very frustrating and sometimes impossible to get a Landlord signed copy of the documents back for our files."
good,long time ago but a fun experience. Very good bosses and work environment.
good,"Each part of my day consisted of different duties such as trade  settlements, reconciliation, fails and trouble shooting.  This kept it interesting and challenging.  I learned a lot having to do with international settlements.  I also have a much better understanding of other departments such as reorg, regulatory reporting and trade support to name a few.  My managers were very knowledgeable and eager to teach.  They were fair and understanding.  My co-workers were pleasant and helpful.  The hardest part of my job was always working against the clock.  But at the end of the day, everything was completed in a timely manner.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the people.  I truly enjoyed working with them each and every day.  It was unfortunate the settlement area relocated to Florida and broke up our family."
good,"I have worked in the financial services industry since 1984 and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. was the best/my favorite employer so far. I don't know what the culture is like now, but I worked there in the mid 90's through 2005. The company's culture was great in the 90's. They are very client focused and do right by their customers. One of the things I loved about Schwab is that they were generous to employees at all levels, not just executive level employees - as far as stock option grants etc. If you were a hard worker, it paid off. There was a lot of opportunities there at that time because the firm was going through a growth spurt. At some point, the focus of the firm seemed to shift slightly (when Charles Schwab stepped down to Dave Pottruck) after acquiring US Trust, increasing client service fees and generally upsetting some of the smaller client base.  But for the most part, the company treated employees well and offered good benefit package etc. - having left and worked for other firms after my time at Schwab, I look back on my time there and wish I hadn't left! They also offered a great ""sabbatical"" program to employees. After 5 years of service, employees were eligible to take a 30-day, fully paid sabbatical, this was in addition to and separate from vacation time. This allowed overworked staff some well deserved and much needed down time during the 90's when the markets were crazy. I had 2 sabbaticals while working for Schwab. That's a very generous benefit that I've never heard of any other financial services firm offering. My overall rating as a former employee would"
good,The company is great to work for! They really take care of their employees.
good,I like the no commission aspect. I like the culture which is interested in taking care of the client.
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,I don't have much to say. My most enjoyable part of my job is speaking to my students.
good,"Good culture, compassionate management and a great corporate training program. Schwab is a great place to work especially for people looking to ""break into"" the business."
good,"Highly skilled people committed to getting the job done. No politics discernable. Everyone pulled hard to be on time, on spec and on budget. Very friendly place to work. Progressive attitude. Outdated technologies, siloed environment but they're trying to fix that."
good,"Great place to work, management is fantastic and enjoys their jobs. "
good,Schwab pays well and they always let you know how much they appreciate you. You never take your work home. Everyone is out by 5pm. Everyone stays there forever. The pace of work there is pretty slow because of compliance so after a few years I felt like I outgrew it.
good,Schab is an excellent company for which to work.  Life/work balance is extremely important at Schwab.  Innovation is rewarded well. The Schwab culture is easy to wok within.
good,"The management team is great, and I truly believe that all employees and opinions are valued. Working in a call center has its ups and downs, but by no means is the work I find myself enjoying."
good,"I loved my job at Schwab. Mid-level management was very focused on employee engagement and the overall culture is VERY client focused.  Executives can be a bit out of touch as too many decisions are made without fully understanding how the sausage is made.  On the flip side, individuals that work hard, have a positive attitude and seek solutions versus excuses are rewarded.  Management roles have lots of opportunities to expand compensation from bonuses and equity awards (adding well over 50% to base salary).  Expect lots of change with the upcoming buyout of Ameritrade (which is also a great company).  Unfortunately, there will be lots of redundant positions that will have to be eliminated.  On the positive side, Schwab provides a great severance package and career transition services."
good,Over 10 years total at Schwab and it's a great place to work.  It's laid back and a collaborative environment. Great focus on the client. Learned a lot during my time there.
good,Solid employer with great opportunities to learn and hone your skills. I would especially recommend to a new graduate as an honest place to work with an ethical culture.
good,"great place with a lot of training engaging, very good culture, very inclusive, opportunity to grow, very stable company, great place to learn anything about the business."
good,"Lot of learning can happen in this work place,"
good,"It was a learning experience working at SIA project. We worked from a vendor location, when ever a Schwab Client came for meeting. They were really open to answer any questions and really friendly personnels"
good,"Leadership is highly transparent, and advancement is largely merit based.  This place is very fair, and it rewards great talent.  Base pay is average, but bonus and equity opportunities exist for top performers."
good,"as a contractor, was treated equally by all.  Culture is very good.  They like to use lots of contractors, if you don't convert after a year, you will need to find a FT gig."
good,"Best job I've ever had. Great pay, great bene' s,  great company that cares for employees. On the job training. No formal training program for CRS. Could benefit from a training program in house for Series 7"
good,Really a good company. Lots of opportunities  when I was there. Company treated employees very well. I fully enjoyed my 11 years there. Left to pursue non business intrrests
good,I viewed my job as part of the team. I was accepted and made comfortable once I settled into the sprint. Everyone was very helpful and friendly to boot!
good,"SharePoint Metric Dashboard Automation with Designer workflows and InfoPath forms and rules.  "
good,Schwab is a great place to work! The people are supportive and recognize/ appreciate strong work ethics. I have worked for them for over 15 years and have found it to be a very rewarding work environment.
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,"The management and culture of Schwab is wonderful. The call center environment is rough, and I was not a fan of that. Overall it's a great company, but I did not want to be stuck at a call center for two years minimum."
good,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-02/charles-schwab-on-his-3-6-trillion-edge-on-the-fintechs is a great article that provides a great perspective on the company history.  What I will say personally is that it is a very ethical company and we have not had any of the other scandals or bailouts other companies have had to endure.
good,"While I do not work with Charles Schwab directly, I do indirectly, We work with them everyday as client support specialists with The Retirement Group. They do a wonderful job helping us with our clients. It is always  pleasure to speak with them and our clients have nothing but great things to say. Based on the upbeat and professional attitudes I have encountered, it must be a great place to work."
good,I loved my time at Schwab! It is an all around ethical company both to employees and clients. I worked my way up from a temp to a manager. Opportunities abound until the lay offs in the early 2000's. After 2006 I believe career building opportunities still existed.
good,"I love Charles Schwab. The most important thing to remember is that the tagline, ""Own your tomorrow"" is extremely accurate. If you don't speak up or step up, you're not going to move forward. Managers are most helpful to those who ask. The toughest part is simply the tediousness of being on the phones taking 40 - 60 calls a day."
good,"- Various schedules available for work/life balance."
good,I'm definitely happy working at Schwab.  I would like to continuemy employment with the firm but am relocating to Los Angeles.  I can definitely say it has been a great experience.
good,The position requires you to have your 7 and 63 to continue employment which they will pay you to study for. The work environment is stressful but your coworkers make it all the worth while.
good,"I like the fact that the company has a great reputation in San Fran and the entire west coast, the salary is competitive and manager are superb. Salary is competitive, health care is good, not great, pay time off is fair compared to the market standards."
good,A typical work day consisted of working with processing staff in an effort to reduce stress on processing day.  
good,"This is a great firm.  There's a strong culture based around the client, and a willingness to be disruptive in the industry.  I worked with great folks at Schwab and the leadership team is top notch."
good,"Exceptional company to work for. The people are awesome, good pay, good benefits. Must like customer service and monotony to thrive here, not much face to face opportunity."
good,"I have been with Charles Schwab for several years. Although one of the largest companies I have worked for - it feels like the smallest. Many of my colleagues are not just peers and co-workers but family."
good,"My role requires me to prioritize effectively and manage multiple projects at the same time. I've learned to collaborate with internal business partners and technology teams as well as with external firms and vendors. The toughest part about my role is keeping members of project teams to complete their tasks to meet deadlines. When deadlines are met and projects are successfully implemented, it is the best feeling."
good,Stared each day working on the SharePoint/Payroll Inbox.  Learned how to use the different options on writing  queries.  Management was great and supportive.  Hardest part was staying on top of the inbox. Enjoyable part were the employees!  Everyone was so supportive.
good,"Unlimited training, overtime, additional licenses and advanced degrees keep you hungry for more.  You look forward to their 1 month sabattical every 5 years as well."
good,"My experience at Charles Schwab motivated me to return to school for finance.  I hope to become a Financial Advisor once I graduate.  Instead of micro management, leadership offers learning opportunities for development."
good,"Great company and great teams to work with. Schwab gives you the ability to path your career to position yourself in the desired field of choice with them. Best way to accelerate yourself through Schwab is to take your series 7/63 and then 9/10 licenses (paid for by Schwab). Failure to do so will limit your career choices with them. Succeed, and the world is your oyster to move mountains."
good,"Company will usually work with employees to address scheduling or family needs. Often new initiatives are rolled out before staff can be fully trained or forms are ready.  Training had been lax in the past, but has again taken on a more prominent focus in the last few years. Most employees take advantage of the company's time to volunteer policy to give back to the community."
good,Great company that truly puts the client first.  Consistently innovates while staying true to initial vision and mission. Best co-workers I've worked with.
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,Charles Schwab is a fantastic company with a great group of individuals. Every employee is determined to accomplish the common goal stated by higher management.
good,Charles Schwab Corp is the best company I have worked for so far. People are nice and cordial all the time. You receive plenty of guidance specially with financial matters. I enjoyed my job 100%.
good,"I think Schwab is an amazing company to work for and would love to make this my home. However the organization is difficult to move from one department to another, specifically into the HR area forcing me to look elsewhere."
good,The company has a lot of room for growth and opportunity. Management is supportive and encouraging. Development is a big focus within the company.
good,"- Great place to start career in financial services"
good,"Review and process all incoming incidents reports for multiple fraud types, affecting customer brokerage accounts."
good,I moved here to get on my feet from being lain off and was so lucky to get this contract position. They have never had a paralegal so they are determining whether it should be a full time position.  Home is in TX though so I need to venture back now that i'm able.
good,"It's a great company to work for this company and I have learn a lot from the management."
good,Where I  utilized All my Known Skills.Work Experience Is good. Learning a lot through this Company.Gives pleasant experience.
good,"Charles Schwab is a great company to work for in many aspects.  The job as an associate financial consultant for Schwab boils down to making connections and building relationships with clients.  My position in the local Schwab branch is to reach out to clients via phone, e-mail to discuss financial planning.  As part of financial planning I would review their current portfolio, discuss any outside assets they might consolidate to Schwab, discuss Schwab's managed account solutions if appropriate for the client and review their overall financial picture.  Financial planning involves discussing estate planning with clients, legacy planning, insurance needs and long term care medical needs, and finally debt management.  The most enjoyable part of my job was building solid last lasting relationships with clients."
good,Good culture of learning/coaching and cooperation. Learned everything about the stock market. Great managers. Fun coworkers. The hard part is being tethered to the phone all day. The most enjoyable part was the team building.
good,I enjoyed my time at Charles Schwab! The environment was extremely comfortable yet the management wasnt as friendly as anticipated. I would definately consider going back there :)
good,"Typical day at work is to organize the workload for the department, and organize my own schedule. Working my caseload, making and taking phone calls from clients, returning emails, writing letters and completing forms for clients, answering internal question from co-workers, organizing team functions and assisting manager on many different levels of support. "
good,"The best team I've ever had, the best boss I've ever had. My Clients in San Francisco and Austin were so wonderful to work with. We produced great work, I learned so much from others, and developed solid relationships when it came to execution and strategy."
good,Great company to work for - excellent management and culture - all top-notch people
good,Charles Schwab is a great company to work for. I think that management really cares about the employees. One issue is that the compensation leaves something to be desired.
good,The management at Schwab for developing internal software
good,"Financial Services is definitely not free from complexity and regulatory restrictions and supervision.  That said, this was very rewarding work and being part of a smaller organization allows you to have close relationships with employees from all areas of the business.  And the work you do directly impacts the client experience and the company's success."
good,"Charles Schwab is a great place to work, as the company has such a nice mission to always be on the lookout for the clients best interest.  "
good,I have to say this is one of the best places I have ever worked. I had a good team and management is very supportive. Each day I had time to perform my duties. I learned many new technologies and methodologies. The culture is very open and friendly. I was given a lot of opportunities to be able to grow my skills.
good,Very diversified culture - great teamwork - it was a fun and great place to work.  I would absolutely recommend Charles Schwab & Company Inc to others as an option for an awesome career.
good,"Schwab is an outstanding company to work for. The phone calls can become stressful, but management makes sure to support you when things get rough. Excellent benefits and there’s an awesome culture."
good,Charles Schwab is a great  company.  I learned a lot as a finance professional and was very surprised at how friendly the culture was. growth is very slow in the company however. This will take time as it grows into a bigger firm.
good,"A Great Company to work for."
good,"The workplace is composed from all generations.  Charles Schwab is a company that emphasizes a strong work/life balance.  I am still new at the company, and I look forward to a long and happy career at Charles Schwab."
good,"Charles Schwab is a great place to work.  The company always take care their employee's by providing flexible schedules, catered lunches, and fun team outings."
good,Good place to work. The focus is on the work produced. Good experience. Management is clear as to what the objectives and expectations are and communicates well with the teams.
good,"When I was there they would say ""we want this to be the place where you can do the best work of your life"" and it was, so far. I believe in their mission statement and found they made a sincere effort to walk their talk. My SVP used to send a birthday card every year and the best manager I've ever had was here. They also did a good job with spot awards and recognition."
good,Good employer (financial sector).  Employees motivated to create and/or discover career paths within the company. Management style is open-door and accessible.

good,"From day one, the sense of belonging and collaboration within the DataCentre team was amazing."
good,"Very fast-paced environment but they do the best they can to make you happy.  Great environment, team-oriented, and the least competitive you could as from a financial service institution.  As long as you can keep up with the pace it is a wonderful job!"
good,"Our day-to-day work was an enjoyable and collaborative environment.  We felt we were contributors, not automatons.  Management listened to our ideas and concerns and would genuinely take them under consideration.  We had a lot of work to do, but the environment made that work enjoyable and rewarding."
good,"Working at Schwab was one of my most enjoyable experiences in my life.  It was hard, focused, but enjoyable and you always had a feeling of accomplishment.  Most managers were understanding and on your side.  As with most places, there were a few bad apples.  Some people should never be in management, but when you run a company based on quotas rather that the person that is right for the job, you run into that problem."
good,"Always willing to help customers with complex information and striving to meeting their needs.Even though I learned a lot from my training and work with The Retirement Group, I learned a lot about financial products and strategies from Schwab as well.. Good workplace culture from my experience with them. Seems like a great place to work and help others."
good,I work with Schwab through The Retirement Group. We utilize their platform for our services. They have done a fantastic job and continue to stay on the cutting edge of services and technology. My clients are always satisfied when they have to deal with them which takes a load off for me. I can say that they are a huge part of my everyday dealings with clients and they have never let me down.
good,"I started working for Charles Schwab in 2000.  Because of Y2K changes, there were a lot of employees who were hired the same time, give or take a few months, as I was."
good,"I had an amazing experience at Charles Schwab.  I was an academic consultant who helped gather data, to form a marketing plan towards a certain demographic.  We were given a team leader at Schwab, who made herself available at any hour of the day."

good,Work life balance is great and the time off available for family life is great.  Pay seems about average for the work done.  I started with Schwab to start a career and would continue with the company if they were not relocating my job to another office.  There would be opportunity for advancement if I was willing to make the move.
good,Excellent company and great people. I met so many good people there who we are still great friends. My boss was effective and interested in seeing that I was happy and that I had what I needed to succeed.
good,"Most positions are very structured, with little room for individual schedule manipulation. 2 of my 3 managers were great, and extremely helpful in guiding my career path."
good,I loved working for this company. I was challenged and also very welled trained. They promoted job advancement and also allowed me to try out different departments. I was very sad when I had to leave and know that I would still be there today.
good,"I was an Intern at Charles Schwab and I had the opportunity to experience the Operations department. The culture of the company is everybody help everybody, and do right by their clients."
good,I learned alot at Charles Scwhab it was a great and fun place to work we had great management and great supervisors Co-workers helped you out with things you didn't know how to do

You can make sure that you do like the business with the pressures of gathering your own assets,  Also, you can learned the business.  They will pay for you to take the Series 7 and also provide classes if you need"

good,I’ve been at Schwab now for over a year and the thing I live about Schwab is that they definitely make sure that the employees know they are appreciated. The managers from Chuck down to Technical and Managing Directors are engaged but not as micro managers. They also have a firm grasp on the need to put the client first and do what’s right. And that mean taking care of the staff as well. I have not found a thing about Schwab that I don’t like except that sometimes advancement means leaving the team and moving into a new team/role.

Education of staff and clients coupled with exceptional service is one of the benefits to working with Schwab.
