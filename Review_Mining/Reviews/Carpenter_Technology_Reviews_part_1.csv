bad,I had a contract position here and was treated incredibly badly.  These people are just plain evil.  I just didn't go in one day despite making a decent wage.  That's how had it was.
bad,Great place to work if you want to be lied to about improving ylirself and moving up in company...will offer you what they said they would when you put in your 2 weeks...great plqce to work if you want to love there ..great place to worl if you ha e no family or life....hire more people to deal with computer system then on the floor
bad,"Absolutely the worst company in berks county they only thing they have to offer is 25 plus dollars an hour that's it they will work you 7 days a week 12 hrs a day all ur vacation days will be denied coworkers will throw you under the bus to save themselves Supervisors and upper management r lazy to help or care about the guys on the floor and don't forget about SAFETY"
bad,"Worst place to work management is bad, supervisor are in over their heads. Dirty, noisy, dangerous environment . Highly flamble and toxic fumes. Under paided and under appreciated. You think Dynamet and carpenter run and run far away."
bad,"This place sux, management sux, they just pretend all is well to the mother ship in Pa, while forming a management click to do as they please, most discriminating place in north Alabama"
bad,"Good co-workers ,like flexible hours ,good pay, paid lunches."
bad,Coworkers are against each other. Not many days off.horrible pay. It takes 4 yrs to hit full rate. Management does not have a clue what they are doing. Senior employees are lazy and cause overtime the the younger guys are forced to work over especially in the bricklayers group.
bad,I enjoy my current position and the responsibilities of my position. There is 0 moral at the Reading facility. Overtime is excessive for no reason. The company management continues to take away any time off. There is no work /life balance.
bad,"Top level executives have forgotten that the most important resource in any company is the people! There are VERY FEW leaders but plenty of managers ready to dictate, blame, micro-manage, and reprimand you for a miss on a low priority task while forgetting how many high priority tasks you’ve completed that exceeded expectations. You are always guilty without the opportunity to prove your innocence"
bad,They work you 7 days a week on a rotating schedule and they can change your hours with less than 24 hours notice without telling you. This place does not care about it's employees at all and they have no problems replacing you. There is no time for a life with this place
bad,"I have found it to be very stressful, no human factor, management can use some backbones."
bad,Not for me. aside from the pay I struggle to find anything else nice to say about it. If you don't want to have a life this would be a great place to work.
bad,I would describe the environment as a bullying like atmosphere. The worst training i have ever received at a job with the most accountability on knowing procedures that you are not sure about. And if you make a mistake on something you haven't been trained well enough to understand you get cursed at by supervisor and or fired!! The top out is 17.75 an hour for being belittled by leadership and not shown any respect by management. HR at this company gives the supervisors full control over their department with no limits on how they treat employees!! Please do not waste your time or put yourself in a situation to be employed here!!
bad,Horrible management machinery wore out diesel power steamer inside the building can't breathe foreman has anger issues manager is the grand wizard of the KKK good luck trying to keep this job if you get it.
bad,"Horrible executive Management.  Employees are livestock.  No consideration for employees or their families.  Everything is about $$$!!!  7 days a week, mandatory work on holidays, no home life.  No opportunity or desire for advancement."
bad,"Admin lady was very rude. But everyone else was nice. But working there you had to work close with admin cause she was there 17 years. Very very ignorant woman. But the other people were very great people. This is a steel company, everything is moved with forklifts/cranes."
bad,Management is at a loss of knowledge.  They schedule you 7 days a week and literally tell you you wont get a day off for a long time.  Absolutely no Home/Work life balance.  The pay is great but whats the point if you cant use any of it.  Not a good place to work if you have a family that you want to see.  Most people like their job.  They are just tired of being there every single day.  Even when there is hardly any work.
bad,"Lots of favoritism.  Poor management, the management will lie to manipulate ppl to do what they want. Not much for time off during weekends to spend with your family."
bad,I worked there for 7 years. I had zero life. I hated every minute of it! Management is incompetent and does not care about employees. It was the worst 7 years of my life!
bad,"horrible management. hr department are incompetent idiots"
bad,The Decatur plant hasn't been open a year and it sounds like it's following in Reading PA's footsteps. I'm sure the technology is far more advanced in a brand new plant. Management seems to be the problem.
bad,Worked there for 10 years still felt like an outsider. No longer there. Not family friendly. Cut throat corporate. Is a dog eat dog world in the corporate world there. They have managers and supervisor with no experience on dealing with people. No guidelines no processes. Not sure how they stay in business this long. They will get caught. It will catch up.
bad,"Pays well, good compensation, rotate shifts with no days off. Place has high turnover. Management has been getting worse and worse."
bad,"Was once a top place to work. Its now a 3rd world counrty sweat shop. Swing shift, 80 plus hours a week."
bad,"Never saw an operation as this. Stuck in a time warp with uneducated sheltered employees.  Cannot fathom how they're still in business as management has no applicable skills.  Everything is their interpretation of well recognized methodologies and practices- and a poor interpretation at that.  A lot of typical Berks Countians--- sheltered, uneducated to how the outside world has progressed and anti-change.  Worst company and management I have ever worked for--- or ever fathomed existed.  Good riddance- I give the place another 10 years at their current pace of outdatedness."
bad,"Current furnace operator. Pay is very good but that's where it ends! Monday thru Thursday 8 hrs. Fri. Sat. Sun. 12 hrs with every 3rd weekend off. Only 2 holidays recognized, those being Christmas eve and Christmas day. If you value family or friends,  do not choose CarTech."
bad,"Most employees work 12 hrs a day and then 8-10 hrs a day on weekends. Nearly impossible to get someone to cover so you can have time off. Extremely understaffed and no one can figure out why."
bad,"Do not apply here unless you are in desperate need of a job. The wages are so low that management schedules overtime and weekends just so you can come in and stand around.  The management is totally incompetent and clueless that I'm surprised the place is still in business.  Things have gotten so bad over recent years under the Carpenter Tech control that they can't find people willing to work.  It went from being like applying for a job in the White House to as long as you pass a drug test and you're hired.  Then after you jump thru hoops to get in, the management bullies you and tries to find way to get you fired.  If it wasn't for the management, this would be a great place to work."
bad,If you seek a way to make 100k a year and dont mind missing out on every family event and plan then this is the job for you. Surprise 12 hour shifts. Surprise working holiday weekends. It is easy to feel burned out.
bad,They hire u for a position they promise to give u then once hired on everything is a lie don’t fall for it just pick somewhere else to work unless u want to b lied too
bad,"You may be scheduled for 5 day work week and end up working 7 10 hour days. They schedule mandatory OT whenever they feel the need with no notice. They will ""ask"" you to stay for OT. If you refuse you get points.. I have seen them fire people with no notice rhyme or reason. They require temp to hire performance for 6 month without guarantee of being hired on full time. The pay and benefits are way out of scale for other similar plants in this field. I do not recommend Shalmet to anyone."
bad,"If you're nothing more than a soulless meat automaton, this is the perfect job for you! Look forward to never seeing your family! 6 month probation. Top heavy management. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. You will get treated like the worthless maggot that the management thinks you are. Pay is okay, and you'll make good money, but you'll be spending half of your waking life to get it."
bad,"Excessive work hours, poor management from supervisor and up.  Will not see your family. Some good union employees. Lots of finger pointing. Stay away"
bad,"Worst Management team I've ever worked for, disrespectful to employees, constant lies, no communicaton at all, Nobody trusts them, Very low morale,  they won't be happy till everyone quits. Excessive overtime has become unbearable. They have a hard time finding people to hire."
bad,There is not much room for advancement unless you are well liked by the right people.  There is no work/life balance.  The company is trying to mirror Alcoa.
bad,"Theres a huge rift between Latrobe and Corporate.. Half the time Corporate doesnt know the crazy decisions Latrobe Front office makes.. Its supervisors quit within a year due to manager pressure and working within the CBA. Its workers face Constant Mind games and daily stress that can cause long term PTSD for the Younger Generation. Its Latrobe Operations President is a sexist bigot, who thinks he is morally and intellectually superior to everyone around him. His Subordinates despise him, His production workers in the mill believe he is a two face liar. I could go on... I been working in hot operations since 2015 and the Union is finally waking up calling Corporate to get control of its Latrobe Front office Circus. The only good thing about Latrobe? Is its rate of pay... I wonder how long that'll last though."
bad,"Used to have a decent culture years ago but under new ""leadership"" the place has gone down to unbearable. The work and facility is god awful. Boring same job day in day out. They always want more hours from you and will change your schedule to 12 hours a day without even asking you. Expect to never see your family, get a decent raise, learn any skills that are transferable or enjoy a single day at this place. Also very unsafe they are unwilling to invest in safe machines and blame employees for any and all injuries (which there are many). People are not valued here they work very hard at trying to make everyone replaceable."
bad,One of the best jobs you will ever hate . Pay is decent much is required of the hourly employees as far as giving any and sometimes all of your freetime away . As hard as it is to get hired there they try even harder to find a way to fire you . So many layers of management and incompetence at many levels . Many various sets of rules depending on who you know or what level you hold in the company . Many workplace ethic rules violated on a regular basis . Special vendors and outside contractors used because of the masonic lodge contacts or what kind of kick backs can be had by management issuing the contract for services. I could go on for ever.
bad,"5 years. I made great money, but could not enjoy it. 7 days a week,12-16 hours a day. If you wanted a day off, you had to call off, but you could only do that 5 times a year, or they would fire you. A coworker had to call off so he could attend his own wedding. The managers are 85% incompetent and will leave you high and dry consistently. I would not recommend working here to my worst enemy, possibly the worst 5 years of my life."
bad,"This place is a joke! They tell you are going to work in a certain department or do a certain job, but then they change it on you all the time. And if you get so much as a runny nose or a cold, you have to go to the medical department to be evaluated - it winter in Western PA duh we will get colds. "
bad,"Good pay for area , but no chance of advancement. Also have to plan on working a lot of overtime.Poor management for the most part also. Seem to be taking away a lot of benefits as of late."
bad,"Very biased management, non supportive by TL's and Supervisors. Don't get into their gossip for entrapment. The culture depends on who and where you're working. Unsupportive of rules and process. low pay sale"
bad,Very stressful   management doesn't make it better just harder for us  keep changing requirements  and responsible but pay doesn't increase   they think you can do everything  at the snap of your finger
bad,My experience there was dealt with alot of babying of favorite employees. As much as you work your butt off the most minor thing will stick out more and you'll be bad mouthed by your employees. The stopped overtime work and made me feel insecure about muy job security. I was terminated on my first offense while others are still there even after committing the same infraction.
bad,No Home/Work life Balance. 7 days a week 363 days a year. Opportunity to make a lot of money but your new address is now Carpenters. Great for someone who is single or wants to be single.
bad,"My manager did not respect senior engineers. Co-op was denied projects solely because the senior engineer was not liked by the manager. Come into work around 7 am, daily meeting, walk the factory floor to inspect units. The hardest part of the job was getting things approved and allowing the engineers to do their job. The manager acted like an engineer, was not a degreed or practiced engineer. "
bad,So much hope.....so much promise....so many lies...i know for a fact every person i interact with is looking for another job. 60+ percent turnover....and there is a reason why.
bad,"If all you care about is making money and don't mind living at work, then Carpenter is the place for you. You don't know what shift you are working from week to week, making it difficult to have a life. Poor management was also another drawback."
bad,"Was a terrific place to work years ago. Treat workers poorly, most management has little experience in the company to understand the processes. Very toxic environment, many workers forced to constantly work overtime including holidays. The quality of the products suffer from mismanagement & poor quality forced to work holidays to work holidays.ffscheduling"
bad,"I worked here for 6 months, in that time there is a lot of money to be made, at the cost of your home life, you will basically live there. The co workers are great people, the bosses and ceo, not so much"
bad,"Unless you are willing to shamelessly service the ego of a delusional megalomaniac you have absolutely zero chance of advancement in the department I work in. The result is a management/supervisory structure made up of limited-intelligence, no moral, individuals whose biggest concern is to raise their rings and praise their omnipotent master. Intelligence, truthfulness and fairness are for the weak and anyone exhibiting these qualities is to be dismissed and buried at all times usually with the complicity of the ""highly respected"" HR department. The worse thing of all is that no one above all this seems to care yet the people on the floor are supposed to."
bad,"Stressful, Very Poor work life balance, Brash one minded sub groups"
bad,"The pay and benefits are decent for this area. The working atmosphere is terrible. Be prepared to be ordered around by morons who know nothing about nothing. Harrasment and constantly trying to get something on you to get you wrote up, days off, or fired! This used to be a good place to work. People did their jobs well,but also had fun and got along with management working long hours and seven days a week. Now everybody walks around miserable and avoiding management in fear of punishment. Forget about the Union! The company runs them."
bad,"Typical Day: 12 plus hours 6 to 7 days a week."
bad,If you seek a way to make 100k a year and dont mind missing out on every family event and plan then this is the job for you. Surprise 12 hour shifts. Surprise working holiday weekends. It is easy to feel burned out.
bad,"They pay you well , but thats about the only good thing. Not a bad place if you dont mind working 7 days a week, 60-80 hours a week with no days off. We are now required to work holidays, 12 hour shifts on weekend. If you dont mind not seeing your family, you could make alot of money"
bad,"-reports"
bad,12 hr shifts 7 days a week most jobs are swing shift all 3 shifts. but if you like money and dont mind spending your life at work to get it this is the job for you.
bad,"Typical day varied greatly. Start times would be either 4 am, 6 am, noon, 2 pm, or 10 pm. The co-workers were typically great to be around. The management was adequate but had very little knowledge of the work because many were hired from outside of the company and were not trained well enough or taught about the work done there. Hardest part of the job was having an order that was complicated or incorrect and not being able to rely on the boss to know what to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was when things were running smoothly and didn't have to change any operations or involve the boss."
bad,Don't take a job here if you don't have to. HR & Managment have set this place up for failure.  The attitudes from all employees make it harder & harder to show up everyday.  The only people who are hired here are moslty kids who have no idea what an industrial envirnment is and HR can pay them less.  The advancement path/ pay rate structure is completely idiotic for production/ maintenance.  The turnover rate is astronimical. Safety is of no concern here.  Most Maintenance electricians don't even have an understanding of basic circuits let alone complex automation.  (mechanical guys are good) Metallurgy group is usually standing around with their hands down the back of their pants or tickling each other.   Can't wait to get out of here.
bad,"Summer was your money time 45 - 50 hours per week , fall and winter 30-35 per week  Overtime is always in summer . Zero in winter Except around the holidays when its not wanted"
good,The job is great for people who want to make a lot of money but are willing to work long hours 7 days a week. Definitely not a job for someone who has a family and kids.
good,When I first got hired you were treated like a valuable asset and the pay was great as were the benefits. Year by year we have been going backwards on wages and benefits while watching the salaried employees wages and bonuses increase. Sad to say but the core of the company values has been left in the past.
good,Place is getting worse and worse by the day. Pay is good hours and management is not at all good. If you work here you will be here 7 days a week 12 hours a day
good,You will be written up for being late the same as if you called off. Was late a couple times due to traffic accidents which I have no control over and written up every time. Even took pics to prove it. They don’t care . They will let you go even if you do your job correctly while other workers are hiding and goofing off.
good,Workdays go from 8 to 12+ hours (5-7 days per week). Workdays go from laidback to very stressful. Management ask opinions of hourly employees but rarely use them.
good,"Poor working environment"
good,"Good employees to work with, but the worst management team I have ever seen. All talk, poor listeners, and blame problems on employees so they don't have to look in the mirror and realize their true shortcomings. Very interesting work and would be nice processes if they worked."
good,Challenging work environment and good pay and benifits but job is harder than it needs to be due to several futile initiatives by management to control and micro manage.
good,"Outstanding plant managers and VP/GMs.  EHS professionals not particularly valued and top levels of management very draconian in management style.  Very good employees with a desire to improve.,"
good,I do not recommend working there now as many things have changed all the way around the culture and work life balance is one where you will be living at your job and praise is often too scare.
good,Different places of work with no notice.  Very unorganized.  Places that we were sent to the people treated us with respect.
good,Long hours. Forced to work weekends . Long hours. Forced to work 12 hour shifts sometimes. High rate of absenteeism. Nice coworkers. Coworkers are friendly and will help you.
good,"The benefits are good, the 401k is the best I've seen.  The work life balance leaves a lot to be desired. Communication among the teams are good but cross communication could be improved.  The environment is very safety oriented and encouraged.  The most difficult part of the job is the ambiguity the quality team must operate in due to a lack of standards in place."
good,"The most enjoyable part of work was most of the people I worked with.The hardest part of the job was working with people that didn't want to be in are department,so they did as little as they had to..Men ruled the work place."
good,"You are a number at this company .The hourly worker is expected too work 7 days a week and rotate 3 shifts with out days off.ON THE PLUS SIDE THEY PAY WELL.,"
good,Work 7 days per week and most holidays.  Management is very disconnected with the workers.  Lots of recent changes that have made the moral in the workforce very low.
good,"Do you want to spend a minimum of  80 hours a week at work, use 1970s technology, work for clueless management, and have one benefit after another taken away? Then this is the place for you!!! You will be utterly amazed at the complete incompetence of most of the managers in this place. One positive is you'll spend most of your time doing nothing while your ancient equipment is being fixed for the hundredth time in a week."
good,"Co-works and management work together to accomplish goals,very safety driven to a point that you will be terminated for noncompliance .This is a dirty,hot,cold environment too work in and very demanding at times you must miss breaks too get equipment running.management does in my opinion appreciate when you do a good job."
good,"If you're looking for a job that pays great this is it!!!  But management is terrible at scheduling work and keeping that schedule.  Usually schedule 10 or 12 hr days then bump back to 8 if the need to (that is ok, but when that happens almost every week).  Work tickets are wrong and need to be approved by management before being sent to correct operation.  (they know they're wrong but it's easier for them for the operators to reject and send elsewhere then for them to fix work ticket)"
good,The corporation is no longer managed by medium or long term employees which eliminated the caring for fellow employees. The corporation was built on the backs of local employees and the profits continue to come from local employees but the investment goes else where.
good,"Typical Work day shift is 6am to 3pm. I manage the CMMS. I review work request/orders, I scope jobs estimate labor and material, I coordinaate with stores, vendors to ensure material is available. Coordinate with operations and maintenance to determine labor capacity for the week. "
good,"Not supervised very well, lots of disorganization, and poor management. The managers never prepared anything and there was a lack of communication between management and production."
good,"People were friendly but the work is very dirty and very hot. With all the personal protection equipment required you get very hot considering you are working around very hot metal."
good,I haven't worked there in years. I don't even know if they still have customer service at that specific location. It's ridiculous I have to do this just to get to the next page
good,This field everyday is a new challenge. Once the co-worker or customer cool down and explain the problem that half of the challenge. Then you can set up a game plan to fix it. Once you fix the problem and a smile come on there face the problem is solve. On the management side long as you using all the technology out there they are happy.
good,Carpenter has several good people working there and has managed to maintain a good culture but the pay is not equal to the job expectation. The company is losing the good workers to local businesses who pay better and are left with inexperienced workers. They will have to step up their pay or risk losing what they built.
good,"Working in technology (3 years ago), I had excellent managers, and I enjoyed working with the engineers, scientists, and other staff. Continuing education was encouraged, and opportunities for advancement were available. My work/ life balance was good. However, I knew people then who were working 7 days/ week with long hours. Since then I've heard that long hours are still pushed, and there is much stress in the workplace."
good,Very fast paced environment. It will keep you busy. There is plenty of work for everyone. Ignore gossip and anything that isn't your business. The pay is based off of cost of living.
good,"Each day consists of servicing a customer account base that deals with multiple product forms of Specialty Alloy Steels. Working with Metallurgists and Engineers I learned how to read certifications, industry specifications, properties of specialty alloy steels, and how to quote multiple product forms within the company's manufacturing capabilities. "
good,"Given the opportunity, most of your co-workers will not hesitate to stab you in the back. lots of good old boy network.The management will turn their heads for the favorites but crucify anyone else they see doing something they don't feel is ""safe"". Safety is heavily preached (and rightly so),but if it gets in the way, its bypassed"
good,You can make good money at Carpenter. But there is a price to pay and that is its extremely likely you will be rotating 3 shifts 7 days a week.they even went to the point of making you work thru holidays. Except Christmas day.
good,Happy to have had the chance with the internship to learn about the industry. And have the possibility at a full-time position offer. Would highly recommend.
good,"I like working here... it was a good temporary position for being new to the Reading area."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Carpenter until June of 2017.  I was placed into a new role untrained, which caused anxiety and stress.  Management advised that I would be trained for the new role; however, I was not.  As a result, I was forced to learn new systems on the fly, which created stress I was not accustomed too."
good,"A good company, but in decline in a number of ways. I was lucky enough to have started here while a company-provided pension plan was available, and also lucky enough to have worked here long enough to be eligible to collect a nice pension as soon as I depart."
good,"Strong company. Good and technical products that are fun to sell."
good,Carpenter is a very team oriented workplace.  Everyone must pull their own weight.  The amount of overtime varies from week to week.  Co workers treat each other with respect
good,"I scheduled orders and assigned materials for the orders.  Also, I made line-ups detailing the steps to complete the order.  Management and co-workers were easy to get along with.  The hardest part of the job was booking orders when all machines were booked already. The  most enjoyable part of job was finishing work on a timely schedule."
good,"Great place to work, yet for my position, there's limited chance for advancement due to the facility is a new facility and the advancement possibility will only come with the future growth of the site which is projected to take place 10 - 15 years in the future."
good,Hourly pay with decent benefits. Must give up some quality of home life to work here. Can be stressful when working mandatory overtime. Some management positions seem to be filled with unqualified personel.
good,Carpenter was a good company to work for offering good benefits and good pay. You will have to rotate all 3 shifts and OT is mandatory.
good,I worked there for over 30 years. I worked my way to the top of the SNE employee ranks as one of the top paid employees. I was in charge od 0ver 20 employees in a 24/7 Lab. operation.
good,"I enjoyed every single day I worked there.  The people were pleasant and helpful.  I was taught the company culture from day one and fit into the dynamic of each environment.  I learned the advanced technology for each business department and gave my best each and every day I was there."
good,"My typical day starts by checking with our manufacturing systems to make sure orders are up to date and moving through the process freely."
good,"There is zero work life balance at carpenter. you are expected to work 6 or 7 days every week even as a salaried employee. Constant cut throat, club mentality. That's just the way we do it kind of thing. Unwilling to change"
good,I interned here and enjoyed my involvement in learning and contributing to the company. I got a nice mix of being in an office and out on the production floor.
good,"poor upper management, not appreciated for work performed. not treated fairly ,too  much overtime, bad attitudes, did enjoy some of my co-workers, had a chance for extra schooling"
good,"Built strong relationships with new clients and maintained level of service and confidence with existing clients.  "
good,My position involved detailed abstracting and there were many interpretations pertaining to the same thing. No clear guideline to follow. Must have photographic memory to do well in the position.
good,Very established company.  Very aggressive leadership.  Great pay and benefits.  Very long hours. Continues to grow.  Has changed over the years with a more negative management.  Really big into operation excellence.
good,"Opportunity to learn about cloud based software and it's use in making payroll easier and understandable."
good,as an intern at Carpenter I learned a lot of new things from the older guys in the shop. There were all willing to help out when needed. It is a good group of guys to work with.
good,Great place to work. Good benefits especially the 401K. Laid back environment and room to grow your carrier. Insurance could be better but overall its not the worst I have had.
good,"Data Input"
good,"As an hourly employee you are expected to work all scheduled overtime. Having said that, if an employee can find a job within the company that he or she enjoys, it can be a rewarding career. The hardest part of working here was the balance of work and personal time. Many times I missed family functions and my child's important events due to overtime and shift work. Most co-workers are great although there is always someone who might be a put off. Lower management usually tries to accommodate employees needs although they seem to be hampered by upper management and production needs."
good,"I have been working at client place and my parental company was cognizant, good company to be with but lot's of work pressure, very bad management."
good,"Carpenter, like any corporation has pros and cons that will appeal to different people.  There are many people with great knowledge and willingness to help you in career.  They are a reliable employer if you are a reliable employee.  They encourage education and self starting."
good,"Great Place to work and great pay. Seems like the turn over is getting better, but still need more qualified people. Overall this is a great place to work."
good,"Used fork lift truck and overhead crane to move material to stock to rack locations.  Use invoices to enter deliveries into computer for inventory tracking.  Performed quarterly audits of materials. "
good,"Carpenter is a fast paced environment on a routine basis.  I probably should have stayed at Carpenter, but after 25 years of service, I was ready for something new.  I enjoyed trouble-shooting machinery and adjusting schedules to meet customer requirements.  This was challenging and rewarding and I love a good challenge."
good,"Took a little long to get all of the access needed and to understand the scope of the position, but after that it was enjoyable, educational, and a really nice place to start in the workplace. Boss had a nice sense of humor and was very understanding and helpful"
good,"Very challenging environment. "
good,"I had great people to work with, management was very supportive throughout my time there. hardest part of the job was working in hot conditions and rotating shifts. not being pressured by management to my job they respected what I had to do."
good,Great place to work with a real hard working American feel. I was an intern so was not out in the mill everyday but I still got to see some things that not many people in the world can see.
good,"Lots of old school guys afraid of the young ones taking their jobs, lots of young, new managers trying to make a name for themselves by whatever means necessary"
good,"I had a position that was a 6 month contract to help out the maintenance department with some office work. The guys there were all very friendly and treated me with lots of respect. A great group of guys to work with. Supervisor was fantastic, he was very helpful and friendly to get what I needed to do this position."
good,Relaxed environment  room for advancement. Negative is 7 day a week work week. No real family / work balance. Besides that good place you could have a career
good,"Pay is very good! "
good,This company has given a lot of People chances to be something better then themselves. Some took the opportunity others did not. Hard work does pay off. This company has a lot of people that will climb over your back for advancement. This is why many people get discouraged. The company had undergone a lot of changes in the last twenty years. It is not the same company when I started. The company is still making money and still in business.
good,"as a material handler i was able to learn various jobs which gave me more machines to work at for over time which is great in the winter time bc there is none but once summer comes its balls to the wall, the pay is great esp when you work 7 days a week there, there are some pretty cool ppl who work there and some who are pretty lazy, sometime the managers are kind of help"
good,Great place to work.  Workers and operators are very friendly and eager to help the new guys.  Wish i had a little more hands on experience however.  ff
