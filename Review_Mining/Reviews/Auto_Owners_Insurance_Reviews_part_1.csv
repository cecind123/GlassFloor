rating,review
bad,Working at Auto-Owners Insurance was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life. They do not care about their employees and management is a total joke. People get promoted based on how long they've been at the company. Majority of managers don't even know how to do their jobs because they lack the knowledge needed for their position and common sense.
bad,"Due to inconsistent leadership, and training I would not recommend this employer to anyone."
bad,"Manager was unfair. micro managed every single aspect of the job. Allowed for no variances, even when it did not affect to amount or quality of the work produced."
bad,No life life life.  Was working there on 9/11/2001 and the management wouldn't let us know what was going on.  They just wanted us to keep our heads down and keep entering data.  Meanwhile we had insurance agents calling and telling us about it.  We were frightened from what we were hearing.  Terrible company to work for.
bad,"Subpar pay, for a company that charges top dollar for their policies, that will drop their clients the first chance they get"
bad,I had to fight all the way thru that place for 22 years what a big let down let again and again micromanagement to intern that don't no anything about there job that has been handed to them
bad,"I thought that when I moved to this company that I would be given the opportunity to advance once I earned my college degree. I found out how wrong I was after I graduated, I was lied to in my interview about advancement opportunities and the pay I would receive. My manager has not worked in life insurance for very long as was promoted based on who she knows within the company (mind you she does not have a college education), the same goes for everyone else that works in a management level position as well. There are all older women that work in management and upper management that appear to do nothing more than gossip about employees. There is a double standard for some employees with the company based on their relationship and if you are not a favorite then you can forget about any advancement opportunities. I left a good job with the hopes of having an opportunity to better myself once I completed my education, I now realize just how wrong I truly was. The only people I would recommend to work for this company would be interns since they will have the ability to gain job experience but will not keep their position as a long term career."
bad,"This was a great place to work until they realized you could be replaced by someone half your age, getting paid half what you made, doing half the work, having half the knowledge and experience."
bad,"When I left, there was one manager that had and probably has no clue what she is doing. I have no idea how she got the position other than being there the longest. Shortly after she was promoted they split the office into 2 separate territories. The new manager had been in the insurance game a long time and tried to ""set an example"" when he came in. He was trying too hard to make a name for himself. So on one end, management doesn't have a clue. On the other end, management is trying to micro manage. Try being in the middle of that mess!!"
bad,"Lower salary than industry but claim you can get up to a 15% bonus based on how company performs but not guaranteed. Not paid for performance, everyone who does their job gets the same raise. The over achievers have to hope they get some random spot bonus/raise, if management likes them. Poor management, it is painfully obvious who their favorites are when new positions open management selects who they want, there is no application process for anyone else who would want it. Wife was in the hospital and they said I could only use sick time for kids, I had to use vacation days."
bad,I felt that employees were doing too much for how much they were paid for doing. Management was very poor and felt that the manager is very unprofessional yet obnoxious. There were always favoritism where they didn't have to take care of hard cases VS those whom the manager didn't like was targeted to do the most work or work on hard claims.
bad,"Some areas Micro -Managements, No Equal Flexibility, Most of associates are afraid of losing a job, if they make mistakes."
bad,"I wouldn't give this company 3 stars if I wanted to.  Because of the following:"
bad,There is little to no support from management in the Appleton branch. Most difficult decisions that I have had to make were overridden by management to the benefit of the agency.
bad,There is no training program so you are going to be frustrated trying to learn anything. The system is outdated. The employees are very nice but managers are inexperienced. Old fashioned
bad,"Worked there for over 10 years, middle management are more like puppets.  They prey on new college graduates because they are naïve to how the company functions.  The technology is far from up to date.  The software/website is constantly down, get used to apologizing to agents.  NOTHING is consistent at this company, every line of business is different (huge complaint from agents, yet they fail to fix it - you're fighting a losing battle to try to help get it consistent).  The company lives in old style ways, its not the 50s anymore.  Many good employees with over 10 years experience have left the company when they are tired of fighting to help advance the company and getting no where.  They do not live up to their morals/values.  Very rare to get a great manager within the company.  Starting pay is around 34K if you have at least a 4 year degree.  There is way too many ""cons"" to list.  The only regret I have is I didn't leave the company sooner when my co-workers did."
bad,Max work for min pay. Brown nosing gets you far with these people because everyone want to feel important even the people with no education.
bad,"Management is not out to help you."
bad,"Old school culture. Strict 8-5 schedule. Organization intentionally pays below market rate for most if not all job classifications. Preference for advancement based on tenure more than talent or ability. Shirt and tie every day, even if you're a claim rep and hopping on a roof that day (you can leave your tie in the car when you get there though). Not a ton of communication or direction from leadership on where the company is going or how they're attempting to solve problems at the associate level."
bad,Hours are cuisine from 3 different shifts all within 7am-5:30pm. Lunch is taking from 11:30-12:30 or 12:30-1:30pm. Pay is very low and agents are more important to the CEO than the employees.
bad,"Male manager doesn't want to give women who have more knowledge than him a fair shake. He specifically said if you want to move forward, you must be a yes person- what he really meant is agree with him although he may be wrong."
bad,"If you like being in a very structured environment where you are told WHEN to breathe, when to go to lunch, when to urinate, then this place is for you. Because I wasn't 12 years old and could think for myself, I ran QUICKLY."
bad,"Very secure company to work for.  Benefits include 401k, health care, dental and vision.  You are given tasks to work on most days either through email or being asked."
good,"A solid company, writes business in lot of states, so being transferred is almost a given. There's a lot of training, but not much room for advancement. Strict chain of command and procedures."
good,"I wasted two years of my life working for this company. If you are type B and like just showing up for a paycheck then this might be ta good fit. You have to wait 10 years for a promotion. Again type B. Thats where the problems really start is there are people in positions based on tenure and not talent. The office politics are awful and people are generally miserable unless in management. The company holds the pension plan high and offers a lower salary. They do have good benefits. That is great if you are using them, not so great if your not. Horrible culture for personal growth. The company does not invest in their employees. They constantly lose the good talent and everyone that stays is who you will be working with. The people that just settle."
good,"The system did the underwriting, people would get promotions that did not make sense, low pay, feeling of not valued. Enjoyed the people, the ongoing education. Hard to see others move that did not qualify for the job."
good,this company micro-manages the work environment.  They take things personally if you make a slight criticism; and focus and to much emphasize on the education material.
good,Great place to work especially for families. good work and family life balance. Flexible if family emergencies arise. Many job opportunities within the company.
good,"It seems like a decent place to work if you have a degree. Those individuals are clearly valued and favored amongst the management. If you don't have a degree, good luck having a voice, a place and being treated as an equal. Also quite the boys club."
good,"Auto-Owners is a great company to start for.  It will give you a good taste of what the corporate culture is all about.  Depending on the department you are in, you could be micro-managed beyond belief."
good,Management is old school.  Things are very different from group to group.  
good,Everyone always says it’s a good company to work for but when you want to switch departments to better yourself and go make more money they don’t let you.
good,"AO does not have competitive pay, though they do have good benefits and offer a pension. Experiences vary depending on the division an associate lands in. Some departments are excellent while others lack in various ways. The company does not exist on the front end of ""leading the charge"" in any fashion. They wait for other companies to begin trends, wait until the trend has been proven successful, then starts developing a strategy to include the trend in their business practices. It is a frustrating practice."
good,In IT it all depends on who you work with. In many cases your group is productive with the best career advancement and in others you're just stuck being micromanaged. The culture seems to just now be joining the 21st century. The pay scale is lower but there is a decent bonus program. Best for people just starting or just want a paycheck.
good,"They utilize old systems and ways of thinking. The salary is terrible but the retirement benefits are good. That doesn't help much if you seeking better pay. No career advancement. The same people play musical chairs from managers to other roles. If you want any career growth you have to relocate to the main office in Michigan. The managers are promoted on tenure not experience, which means they end up micromanaging instead of developing employees. The culture is dry and stale. Either a good place to get your foot in the door for experience or a place to end your career."
good,"It is the life of insurance! Boring, turtle paced and statistical. This is the type of career you enter if you do not necessarily care about growth and change."
good,Workload is way too much for what you get paid. High turnover rate (in my office at least). Very strict dress code....old fashion company with slow changes.
good,"Insurance claims office for the North West Georgia area.  Very High stress job, High volume, high stress job - non stop all day - multi-tasking at its best."
good,"This company works hard for their employees, but the benefits offered don't necessarily equate to the work expected from the employees.  Employees are expected to work longer than normal hours to get the job done, but overtime pay isn't offered.  The offices are small, so a friendship forms easily among your peers."
good,I haven't worked there in a long time so I don't feel comfortable review how the company operates currently.  I feel it was a good start to my career at the time.
good,welcoming work environment...at first
good,"Overall good place to work, but management in my office was awful.  If you can handle being yelled at my customers on a daily basis, this is the job for you,."
good,"Auto-Owners in general is a great company. But, when it comes to individual branches management can be inefficient, unprofessional, and uncaring. Need more experienced professional management."
good,I was one of several staff adjusters at the time of my employment. I was treated fairly and enjoyed my time with the company in that office.  The administrative staff was very good.
good,"Auto Owner's Insurance Company is well known for providing super outstanding service to their customers.  With the motto of ""the no problem people"", they reiterate that when providing the best possible service available."
good,"Great company to work for overall, but limited opportunities for project management career path.  Compensation is lower than average but the company has not laid-off an employee in the 99 years of its operation.  Great benefits package includes matching 401K and pension plans.  Promotion from within only."
good,"Due to continual turnover, Auto-Owners invests a great deal of time and energy into training young underwriters.  They also help prepare them to work effectively with agents."
good,"Good company, poor Management. Management has own style at each branch that is inconsistent with company guidelines."
good,Good learning experience for new insurance professionals.
good,"My typical day at work begins with prayer of serenity/wisdom, then review my work diaries of tasks for completion. I proceed to work diligently to complete my tasks, while balancing any supervisory duties to assist our claims manager.  I have a great working relationship with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is sitting but I balance this by alternating sitting, walking and standing.  The most enjoyable part of my job is developing working relationships with insured, policy holders, attorneys, medical providers, etc."
good,"Would like something closer to home, better pay for all the hard work i do. I am very dependable, always work hard everyday including completing others work"
good,Nice place to work with very enjoyable coworkers.  Benefits and hours are well worth the job.  Multi-tasking is a must.  Many jobs compounded onto position.
good,Each division is completely different. Hiring in with a degree is far more beneficial to you rather than earning one while working there. Not a bad atmosphere but very old school.
good,"This job was very exciting in the Advertising Department.  I enjoyed working with creating ads, selling advertising packages and negotiating contracts with different media members.  The Underwriting department was horrible however.  Strict and unfriendly manager,"
good,"answer phones "
good,"My typical day consisted of handling a large territory of 23 counties averaging 190 claims on a monthly basis. I would handle property losses (residential and commercial) and general liability losses. My previous employer had adjusters doing either auto claims or property claims. We would work the whole file. No specialty teams. I got along with peers and superiors. My manager was relatively new as I only known her for 11 months; therefore, we did communicate on a constant basis in regards to my territories. The hardest part was dealing with the 23 counties. I was the only adjuster for this company to handle that many counties. My most enjoyable part of the job was handling 1st party property claims. It felt good helping people in their time of need."
good,Investigation and processing of work injury claims.  Answering phone and making contact with the insured and worker that same day.  Fast paced and constant changes of expectations from the workers.
good,"This is not a bad job at all, but it is not a job for someone that is wanting a career. It is a glorified call center position, and it is quite a thankless job. The insureds say thank you more than the managers do. There are always more calls coming in, and projects to do, so you're never bored, which is a good thing. However, it is quite easy to get burned out, unless you are driven about claims and insurance. Advancement is possible, but you need to be willing to wait at least a year, and even then it is not overly easy. Upper management is great, middle management is not as great, sometimes it feels as if they are disconnected from the rigors of the job itself. Overall, I would only recommend this position if wanting to get into the insurance world, and if you are willing to work from the bottom up to the top in a very conservative company."
good,"A good place to work, but they lack in technology and promotions are very inconsistent.  I just got tired of working for people with less experience and qualifications."
good,You will have a unreasonable work load. Auto-owners will require you to handle way to many claims.  If they hire one person then that means that that position is enough work for three people.
good,Auto-Owners Insurance is a nice place to work.  The hire from within and they have a very positive family like culture.  The benefits are good and the job stability in my opinion is exceptional!
good,Easy going work environment. Great Management with room to elevate your position. Co-workers are enjoyable to be around with no in house problems or complications.
good,"Great people, great work life-balance, a bit micro-managing, low pay. I've had an overall positive experience working at Auto-Owners Insurance Company."
good,"Treated well financially.  Company offers competitive salary, good benefits, 401k, pension, profit sharing and bonuses."
good,"On a daily basis I tested the mainframe CICS system for quality. While working there I was able to get some training in Underwriting, which I thought was very interesting. I was assigned a ""mentor"" when I hired in and this person was extremely helpful, I was able to ask them any question and they helped me with learning how to do the job. It was a great place to work."
good,Long hard work days but the day was excellent. I got to work with my grandma so it was hard but auto-owners was very accommodating and helpful when and where they could be.
good,"Depending on the job you are in, it can be a very stressful job.  Some job positions are not as stressful.  Need a good work ethic.  Fair benefit package."
good,Direct supervisor was difficult to work with and unwilling to instruct on what was needed to be successful in the job.  Co-workers are great and the job was really good with the exception of my supervisor.
good,Managed multiple lines for the State of Virginia. Our growth lead to the claim office becoming a regional office. Profitable and positive feedback on claim handling. High retention of current business.
good,Auto-Owners is a traditional corporate environment. This is a company that is great for those entering the corporate atmosphere to learn traditional business etiquette.
good,"A typical day begins at 8 am with checking messages and my work folder. I process hundreds of claims at a time, giving the best customer service available. This job includes negotiating, policy interpretation, excellent communication skills, etc. "
good,"- Insurance processing"
good,I love the people I work with. I enjoy the job. Good Benefits. It is a great job. Very Stable.
good,If one wants to inquire about working for the company one needs to apply and get hired.
good,"Lots of data entry and customer service; primary function was to service the independent agents. Most all contact was via telephone, email, or handwritten correspondence, very little one on one contact. Co-worker relationships were great for the most part. The hardest part of the job was dealing with billing complaints, as there was little to no training for billing situations. The most enjoyable was the relationships built between the customer and the employee/company."
good,Auto-Owners has good agents to work with and the people are generally nice.
good,Fast paced work environment for people willing to reach out for challenges. Great values and overall desirable corporate culture. Wonderful opportunities for most hard working employees. Decent pay and benefits.
good,"Auto-Owners is a great company. If you are looking for a summer internship this is a great place with lots of opportunities. You will not be a regular intern who goes and gets coffee, instead you will be trained like a regular associate to help with the work load."
good,"Auto-Owners and the claims industry is very challenging, both personally and professionally. Typical workday includes answer phone calls, returning messaging, investigating claims, and basically dealing with problems. Almost every single point-of-contact made as  problem or issue they are looking to you to resolve. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you have helped somebody in need!"
good,Auto-Owners is a very good company that treats their employees with respect.  I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a job in insurance with a regional property casualty insurance company to consider Auto-Owners as a top choice.
good,"Nice people that are willing to help one another."
good,"Lots of time spent on the phone, too many claims to keep up with. Other people have left the company to go to other insurance companies to make more money and handle fewer claims."
good,"Overall this was a great company to work for.  Opportunities can become limited if you don't want to relocate.  If you like a fast-paced environment,  it could be the place for you."
good,Good company to work for. Many of the employees have been there for years. Financially sound company. Operates in 26 states.
good,"I enjoy my job as an underwriter and have gained a wealth of knowledge during my first year in this position. I have a clear understanding as to what is expected of me and am able to produce a large quantity of work without sacrificing accuracy. I have developed positive relationships with fellow associates and outside agencies as well. The most challenging part of my position is balancing phone calls, emails, and system review, however, time management skills allow me to overcome this challenge. The most enjoyable part of my job is the freedom to manage my work as it works best for me."
good,All co-workers got long. Learned new things everyday. Management did not listen to you suggestions. Most enjoyable part was being able to travel to different states teaching software.
good,Relationships are a core value and it is obvious that associates have good internal relationships with one another and are encouraged to have positive working relationships with outside agents in the community.
good,"Teamwork stressed, good management support. Working claims department was fast paced and stressful. Constant phone work trying to settle claims and working with upset people."
good,A stable job with very good benefits.  Employees dedicate their career to the company for a long time.  Continued education was highly recommended for advancement.
good,Receive new claims and make initial contact same day. expanded my knowledge in commercial claims handling. Management is helpful when it comes to coverage evaluation. co-workers are always willing to help when needed. The most enjoyable part of this job is helping policy holders after a loss.
good,Auto-Owners is a great company to be apart of.  They reward hard work and continuing education in the insurance industry.
good,"Nice professional company to work for. Enjoyed Lots of job experience in different areas of the Accounting department. enjoyed working with different teams of people through out my career with company, until I retired after 29 1/2 years."
good,The best and worst part about this organization is the libertarian approach toward the work. There is variation in management philosophy and best practices between branch offices and regions.
good,"Good company."
good,"Auto-Owners has good morals and reveres honesty. Great benefits and pension which is very rare these days. But claim handling is tough as AO has high expectations and adjusters have little support on claims. AO still handles claims ""from cradle to grave"". which means adjusters handles entire claim. Makes claim handling stressfull due to lack of support."
good,"I went to Auto Owners right out of college and it was a tremendous first job.  I sometimes wish I would have stayed and would like to return now.  But, the pay was a little below normal for the area so I moved on."
good,"Everyone was very job focused and friendly. Very posititve in helping other succeed. Management was always available to answer questions with an open door policy. For me it was a new job all together, but I feel I covered a lot of ground and learned quite a bit just from my team. Teams of other departments were always very friendly and checking in on me as well to help me grow in the position I worked in."
good,I really enjoyed working here.  The company takes great care of you and provides good benefits. There was a lot of room for growth within the company.
good,Productive and fun workplace at times there were intense goals to be meet however for the most part the office was like a big family environment. I feel as the toughest moments where dealing with the customers that were homeless and there were procedures we had to follow in order to assist them.
good,"A typical day was fast paced."
good,"There will never be a moment of down time and days will go by quickly, but your phone will always be ringing. Team work is promoted, but it is hard to help others when your work is behind."
good,Very high sense of job security. Good pay and great benefits.
good,"Auto-Owners provides an environment that has been beneficial to my growth as a person and an employee. I am pushed everyday to perform at the highest possible level, while at the same time providing the best possible customer service to each individual agent. Underwriting forces time management, attention to detail, and applying common sense when looking at the big picture."
good,"During my internship during the summer. I was forced to relocate to the HQ branch in Lansing without any compensation for this. Once there, training took over half of the time that I was employed there. Training was extensive and redundant to what I already knew."
good,Very family and value oriented. Great. Benefit options and bonuses. Opportunities for employees. Stable and consistent work load. Offer insurance courses paid by company
good,"Auto Owners is a good, stable work environment.  I haven't worked there for many years, but my experience, overall, was a positive one. "
good,Good place to work. Claims and underwriting work together nicely. Large work spaces with activities to involve employees together. Great benefits and bonus opportunities.
good,"The company is a large, financially stable company with many opportunities.  The company portrays a close knit, laid back atmosphere. "
good,"I have been very pleased with the people I have worked with so far.  I used to work in claims in Indiana, and now I currently work in North Carolina in underwriting.  Everyone in the company has been great.  The pay may be a little lower than some other companies but Auto-Owners has a fully funded company pension plan.  Not many companies offer pensions anymore."
good,Auto Owners is a wonderful place to work with much room for advancement. You must have a degree or be willing to take classes in order for advancement. Great people to work with and for.
good,"A typical day at work involves inspecting losses on location, meeting with the insured, meeting with contractors, writing estimates for any repairs that need to be done, and maintaining a good personal experience with the insured."
good,As a consultant I enjoyed challenging projects and client gives lot of freedom to explore and implement new ideas. Projects are for long term.
good,"Stable Company to work at, set hours, desk job and no travel, freedom to work individually on tasks each day but enjoy group teamwork as well."
good,The typical day is working 8-4:30 in a cubical in units of territories. Management is available for questions most of the time.
good,It is a great company. Management is unique. I love what I do. I am busy and enjoy the fast pace. I do a great deal of customer service with agents and insureds as well as all of the event planning and seminars for the Marketing Representatives.
good,I was overqualified for the position when I accepted it but was promised that opportunities for advancement would come up. I waited six years before leaving.
good,Auto Owners is a great company. They offer job advancement within first which is a great feature. They also have great benefits and vacation perks that compare to most large companies.
good,"If you are looking for a career in which you can advance, get fair job performance based raises, meet people, and make a difference - Auto Owners is the place for you."
good,"I really appreciate that the company allows flexibility in your workday and unlimited PTO.My co-workers are easy to work with, and I feel supported by team leads."
good,"The management gives good encouragement. The other employees created a great environment. The day to day work is extremely stressful. High work load, overtime is needed to complete tasks."
good,"Excellent company to work for, great benefits, management that cared about their employees as well as their customers."
good,"Great company with loads of advancement opportunity.  Work hours are not unreasonable, between 40 - 50 a week."
good,"Auto-Owners has a great work environment with plenty of opportunities to connect with other people who work there. Be prepared to work, but it's definitely worth accepting a job offer from them"
good,Management personnel are helpful and approachable. Individual workload is large and workday can be very hectic. The hardest part of the job is workload. expectations.
good,"The company has an extensive training program and investment in their employees. The company does care about it's employees, the independent agency partners and our insured's."
good,"Poor management. Great company but this branch needs a new manager. Great benefits, hours, coworkers, headquarters. Wouldn't not recommend this branch to work at"
good,I have learned a lot working here. The drive for me wasnt the best. I lived almost an hour away. They treat you like family. It definitely was a pleasure working there.
good,"Worked under a short contract, but really enjoyed the staff."
good,A typical day would be coming in and getting right to work scanning documents and keeping them in the correct order. Once the scanning is done the next thing would be to move on to properly filing away the documents in its correct folder and section. While working there I learned how to operate a scanner and how to look for errors and correct them. While working I found that the most enjoyable part of this job were my co-workers and the help that they gave me my first couple of days on the job and them helping me get adjusted to the fact pace.
good,"Decent company, far too conservative.  Management is antiquated and they need to modernize."
good,Auto-Owners is a very good company that treats their employees with respect. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a job in insurance with a regional property casualty insurance company to consider Auto-Owners as a top choice.
good,"I have had the utmost fun at this job.  Auto Owners operates in the most sane and professional manner I have ever experienced.  I have never met auditors who delivered their results personally, with a lunch, and I have never seen employees accept critical review so humanly and professional.  There was disappointment in the verdict but everyone in the room was upbeat and confident they could deliver the suggestions for improvement well within the time frame."
good,"I’ve worked in 3 different offices at this company. The morale of the team very much depends on your management team. I’ve worked in offices with terrible morale and in ones that are great. Benefits are pretty great - retirement includes a pension plan and they provide benefit dollars toward your health, dental, vision insurance, etc. You don’t even work a full 40 hour week (37.5). The only negative thing I can say is that it’s been difficult to advance but that depends on your ability to relocate. The other negative is that the salary is technically lower than the national average for each position however the benefits package is really good."
good,Team was great. They really cared about the people. Always willing to help and grow with the company. Made a lot of life long friends here. Great place to grow your career
good,Great company to work for. They want the best for you no matter what. They want to see you exceed no matter where you go. The work culture is very welcoming.
good,"I learned a ton about insurance.  I would really have enjoyed being an Actuary if I had studied that years ago,  The environment always seemed unhappy and no one wanted to be there.  The hardest part of the job was the phones and people avoiding the phones.  Felt like an overpaid customer server representative job."
good,"I love the people I work with but hate the people I deal with "
good,"I loved working at Auto Owners, Being a claims adjuster is very stressful and I would have liked to change departments if I didn’t have to move far away."
good,The company is very understanding that we are human beings and treat us with respect. They do a great job with a work/life balance. People are very friendly and typically easy to communicate with. The benefits are very nice as well.
good,I enjoyed working for Auto Owners Insurance.  I left because I received a better job offer making more money than they were paying at the time.  If I had the opportunity I would consider working for them again.
good,"This is a great company to work for if you have a family. Stable employment, decent salary, excellent benefits. If looking for stable employment, I highly recommend Auto-Owners Insurance."
good,"Probably the best management I've encountered so far, very understanding and are there to help you grow.  Management is considered more of leaders than boss's."
good,"All of the people I work with are amazing. Everyone is so welcoming and will take their time to help you learn your role. I have been here for 6 months so far and still go to my mentor now and then if I have a question. Overall, I love the work environment and the people I am surrounded by on a daily basis. Also, as an Intern, they let you shadow different departments within the company in case you find something other than Underwriting catches your interest."
good,I just could not please my direct supervisor. She holds a grudge over a problem with issues of taking her word on things and not being treated fairly.
good,"Great working environment"
good,very good company to work for heavy work load sometimes not manageable would recommend adding staff to better serve the customer. I felt the company has high integrity to deliver the best customer service
good,I'm fortunate to work with a great group of people who make every day great.  I also have an awesome manager.  Compensation isn't high compared to other places but there is job security which is nice.  No layoffs in 100 years!
good,"From my first day I was given a great deal of responsibility in controlling the personal success of my internship. Everyday I would be in control of my own claims dealing from the call (either receiving calls from claimants or making calls to insured and/or claimants), to issuing payments dealing with thousands of dollars of damage. I learned a lot about dealing with people from a business standpoint, from people who expect a great deal of professionalism to people who are trying to pull a scam on the organization as a whole. I had the pleasure of dealing with a very successful branch manager and was able to develop a working relationship with him. I also had the pleasure of speaking with and getting to know a highly successful regional vice president. My co-workers were very helpful and I was immediately welcomed into the working force. The hardest part of the job was dealing with different situations everyday and not knowing how people would respond to what I was telling them. This was also the most enjoyable part of my job because I was able to formulate new solutions multiple times per day."
good,Strong value/moral base. Lots of opportunity for advancement. Out-dated internal systems.

While there I was able to job shadow all departments in the Life Company.  The atmosphere at Auto-Owners is very friendly, almost family like.  That was easily the most enjoyable part of my job.
