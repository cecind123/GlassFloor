bad,"The call center treats employees terrible. Any other department, you are still treated like a human. If you're in the call center, you're a number. You might as well be cattle."
bad,"Good pay "
bad,"Due to the botched merger with KCP&L, this company is now viewed as a bad one to work for. Most of the people are good people but the way the entire corporate team kept hammering home that the deal was a sure thing really has turned off a lot of people. We went through the entire year long process that included new roles being laid out, people getting promotions and demotions, and people who chose not to join the new company and take a severance. Now the deal has failed and they expect everything to go back to normal, it's ""business as usual"" as they like to say. We won't really know what damage this abortion of a merger will create for a few months. Who knows, maybe the ""For Sale"" sign will go back up in the front yard and the whole process starts over again. That would be really good for employee morale."
bad,"There a lot of good people who want to do good things working for Westar and like most large companies, there are some who can make life extremely difficult for the people who work for them.  Working rotating shift work is draining and takes its toll on the family."
bad,"If you want to be micromanaged work here. It seems like you need to check in to go to the bathroom. As I had read in a previous review, it is so bad that everyone is afraid of making the wrong move and getting fired. It is no fun working like that!!!"
bad,"The general mood in the General Office is very uptight.  There seem to be a lot of unspoken rules.  A lot of people were worried about doing some (minor) thing wrong and getting fired.  Very much an old white guys club at the top and the next generation of leadership being groomed is also a boys club.  Lots of cronyism."
bad,Westar Energy has long been known as a great employer.  Unfortunately the culture has changed as demands have greatly increased on the employees. Moral is declining as generating units are shutting down and jobs are being eliminated or moved.
bad,"For the operator, the climate is a key contributor to how your day will proceed.  Depending on the type of fuel used at the plant you may spend much of your time outside checking the condition of or actively removing ice, snow, or be involved in any number of coal ash related activities.  Regular rounds are made on each unit and each having a different route, but similar readings taken on individual units.  Although generating units may appear the same, each one has different characteristics and slightly different piping configurations, making each totally unique in both overall capacity and operation. Typically the operations teams work in crews of 3 or more people, qualified at different operational levels, and given separate areas and equipment to monitor and care for.  In the fleet currently (2018) work schedule involves a forward rotation of either 12 hour or 8 hour shifts consisting of both days and nights. The operations department decides per plant on an agreeable shift rotation to cover all the necessary functions and equipment needs. Days, nights, evenings, weekends, holidays, are expected to be worked when scheduled as there can be no interruption of electricity as it is an essential service. Safety of plant personnel and equipment is of high priority as is training and understanding of each system and its intended design parameters. Compensation is usually a little higher than the average wage due to the adverse temperatures, demanding shift schedule, and higher degree of training needed to run multiple complex process systems simultaneously. Generally the benefits"
good,"good company when started 35 years ago, work ethics are dwindling fast, not what you can do,,its who you know, mangers with no experience in the field. employees only their for check no pride in the work"
good,"Pay is acceptable, but hours required are much more than 40 hours a week.  Some managers are flexible, demands are high and not much tolerance for learning the job. Other employees might feel different."
good,"I was originally hired on as a contractor and the plan was to be hired full time after a certain period of time, but the recent merger activities have delayed the hiring process indefinitely."
good,should of had more management in how they wanted things run correctly...They were not prepared as they should of been...It was a new contract for temp work that they were putting in new meters in all of wichita ks.. we had to set up ajnd organize how to do all of the meters that came out of old homes and businesses and new meters that were to go in
good,"Pay is good for the area as are the benefits.  The culture and corporate attitude are very dated and need to be updated.  Younger workers will probably choose another company in the KC area vs working here because the attitude, culture and advancement opportunities are all very old school."
good,The key to success is to be open to change.  Westar has had it's share of change over the past decade.  I have found in my work experience that it is the people at Westar that make the transitions and moves easy.  In society today it is hard to find a job much less one that pays well and you enjoy.  The co-workers here look out for each other making my job more enjoyable and make it easy for me to show up.
good,i only was there a few months but everyone is really nice. friendly work environment not many places like this anymore. i just cleaned the yard to help cut overtime
good,"Typical day of work: downloaded your route(s) for the day and literally walked house to house and read the customers gas and electric meters. Dealt with happy and unhappy customers every so often. Dealt with good and bad dogs because you have to enter 95% of the customers back yards to access the meters. We were out no matter the weather - rain, storms, heat and snow. "
good,"Westar Energy is unique in that it customer's don't have a lot of choices for their service.  It takes a very thick skin to work in the call center, but can be fulfulling"
good,"The company pays great and benefits are good.  Working in the call center can be stressful and has a high burn-out rate.  It's very difficult to move up unless you are related to upper management or a hand selected young recent college graduate.  Most advancement opportunities are not open to all employees.  Most are only open to those invited to apply.  Getting time off for a doctor's appointment can be very difficult because employees are limited to scheduling the appointment two hours at the beginning or end of your shift.  This wasn't a problem for me, but for those with children, they may want to consider the lack of flexibility."
good,"Fun workplace with great coworkers, but training is disorganized.  Job description is not clearly outlined.  Great pay and benefits."
good,"very stressful, customers are mean, management is just ok. lots of metrics to meet, mandatory overtime, good benefits, lots to learn , 6 weeks of training, good pay"
good,"Westar Energy was a great place to work, benefits and compensation wise, the work itself wasn't bad at all and I loved the work I did. The way the management runs the company isn't the way a company should be ran. They micromanage everyone until everyone has a very low moral. If you aren't in the ""in crowd"" you have no way of advancing at all. You will be stuck in the same position."
good,Educate yourself and do not get comfortable in one position. Keep moving around and gain as much experience as possible. Get to know people that will help you be successful.
good,Good place to work.  Very friendly employees and management.  Always updates on changes and training.  Wished the contract would have lasted longer.  Enjoyed learning new things.
good,worked in a highly energized department that was fast-paced and enjoyable. I learned to be an effective leader there
good,"A typical day at work consists of meetings, running lots of queries to obtain data, and compiling data into a format that summarizes information that is beneficial to the particular end user. There is some math involved, but the majority of the work has to do with turning numbers into a narrative."
good,"It's not unusual to bump into someone in the break room, that could be the maintenance or a supervisor.  But no matter someone's title, everyone makes it a point to say ""hello""."
good,"Is a great company if you basically can make Westar your #1 priority. Meaning that your life have to circle around the company. Vacation, time off etc"
good,"Westar is a good company that offers stability, fair wages, and great benefits. They care about their employees, their customers, and their rate payers. They believe in Reliability Centered Maintenance and Continuous Improvement. I would consider them progressive in their approach to Reliability Centered Maintenance and Continuous Improvement."
good,Progressive utility with a financial focus. Management culture varied greatly based on the leader except all were on the same page for safety. A top employment choice in most areas of Kansas.
good,Everyone is focused on looking out for one another.  Safety is included in all aspects of the business.  Culture is becoming younger and more vibrant.
good,The atmosphere at Westar promoted advancement and self improvement. Work environment promoted team work and collaboration. My position was contract.  If the office was not in Topeka I would have pursued a permanent position.
good,"Overall a great place to work.  Good work life balance, great benefits and great overall team collaboration.  Management is in tune with day to day work as well."
good,"Every day i was assigned a specific route/neighborhood that i had to attend to. There was constant driving, but even more walking when having to read meters."
good,"Customers call to start, stop, or transfer electric service. They may also call to pay their bill or need help finding a payment center"
good,This internship gave me knowledge and experience which didn't know I would get from it. I was completely taken by surprise with how friendly everyone was and how enjoyable it was to work with them.
good,"Data entry, 10 key, multi task, multi line phones, fax, email, payments, being able to do the same thing over and over again every day but every day you learn something new, being able to bite your tongue when getting yelled at by a customer and being able to calm that customer down"
good,The partnership was fun and informative! I like that we had to create a solution to a current problem in the company and that we competed against each other.
good,"Coordinate crews and work for largest region in company."
good,Most aspects I enjoy and appreciate although do not like the way Westar used temporary employees.  One temp has been here 8 years and doing a great job but they wont hire as permanent to receive better pay and benefits.  So wrong.
good,"As a CSR (customer service representative) for Westar Energy I speak with numerous people a day over the phone. I try to resolve any problems they may have and answer any questions pertaining to their account billing and electric service. I assist customers also trying to access their account online on our website. I am a bilingual CSR so I also take several Spanish calls throughout the day. I have learned how to maintain a professional attitude during each and every call regardless of the nature of the call. The most gratifying aspect of my job is when a customer is genuinely happy and thanking me for assisting them, it makes me feel good to know that I was able to do something to help them out."
good,"The management team is excellent, they were willing to answer any and all questions I had while trying to see and develop my skillset. They were a true family based company."
good,Good place to work as an intern. Topeka inst exactly a great place to live. Great upper management who will do anything to help you succeed and work through projects/ tasks.
good,Awesome Benefits and pay. Long hours and a lot of overtime. Shift rotation and holiday work. Must keep  head on a swivel because the job can be dangerous.
good,"Westar Energy is fair to their employees, maintains a good atmosphere. Work recommend working for Westar. The overall workforce at Westar has a common goal, to work together and provide a safe atmosphere."
good,My typical day at my job is fast paced. I work on customer accounts billing to make sure each account has billed correctly for their usage. I enjoy working with my co-workers.
good,"Great employer. I really enjoyed the time I worked for Westar. Every job has its ups and downs. Here, I mostly had good days!  Focus on leadership development, which has been lacking in the companies I've worked for since."
good,"I am pleased with the companies policies and since participated in merger activities smooth transfer."
good,"I had the opportunity to work with some of the best people in my career.  We did many controls upgrades, and learned a lot.  They really felt like family."
good,"I loved working at Westar and the only I am leaving now is due to the fact that their meters are going automatic, however I have been fully aware that this was happening. Great work environment and great with working with you on your schedules."
good,"Working under the supervision of skilled journeymen, learning more skills and loving what I did every day. The employers were very nice and helpful getting me started with work."
good,My typical day was data entry. My co-workers were helpful. My boss was an excellent teacher. Sometimes it was difficult for them to find work for me.
good,One of a kind job. Independently worked by myself on the job and consistently provided complete work responsibilities and great customer service.
good,"I enjoyed working at Westar Energy.  Employment centered around the protection of the critical infrastructure of assets require to operated power plants, substations, and control centers.  This was accomplished by compliance with national industry standards, and daily evaluations of policies and procedures.  I needed to resign due to family commitments."
good,"Committed to safe, reliable and cost effective electricity, offers a lot of opportunities in skilled and technical, engineering, administrative, marketing, and leadership."
good,"Always something to do, motor start studies, coordination studies, imbalances, switching, design, field work, and more. Everyone wants you to learn. You can job shadow others and lots of travel."
good,Best place to work in Topeka!  Great workplace culture and benefits.  You would be luck to work for this Company.  Very impressive place to work.  I've been here for 32 years
good,It is a great place to work. I really enjoy working for Westar. If you work hard you will be rewarded. Great people and great working environment. Management is awesome.
good,the guys were vary helpful in teaching new guys eazy to get along with and all ways wanted the job done right. if you didnt know how to do something they would take the time to show and explane how and why it works
good,Very strong company and enjoyable to work for.  I relocated to be nearer spouses family after 25 years with this company. I would have been happy to have stayed for my entire career.
good,"Great Place to work. Great Pay, Great benefits & great company to work for. There are great people who run this company and would love to have you apply"
good,"Great place, great atmosphere, productive work environment, and great management. Typical work day was receiving good and doing a count, entering the data in the computer system. Also ensuring computers returned were wiped and no sensitive information is present on the drive."
good,"Worked for 18 years, was able to be promoted several times, based on work experience and performance.  Was a pleasure to work for them."
good,Great people and great company. excellent compensation and benefits. they promote from within a lot of the time. I was able to learn a lot and everyone was really helpful.
good,Never know what a standard day of work would be in the world of electricity. I have grown a tremendous amount in the 2 years of employment with Westar Energy. Great people to work around. The hardest part of the job is getting the training needed to succeed in the Relay Apprenticeship program.
good,Reading meters has allowed me to learn about the area and meet new people.  It has also allowed me to learn about how electricity is supplied to people.
