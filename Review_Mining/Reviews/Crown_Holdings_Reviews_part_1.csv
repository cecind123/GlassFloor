rating,review
bad,"Don't work here, dishonest management and low pay, they steal from their employees. Very hot climate, no ventilation, management doesn't know what they are doing."
bad,Poisonous workplace culture where bullying and backstabbing occurs constantly. Management is well aware that it is happening and does nothing. Rampant favourtism by management. Low-skilled/lazy support personnel. Insufficient training for machine operators/maintainers. Employee committee that ignores legitimate concerns. IT infrastructure which is decades obsolete. The most dysfunctional team I have ever worked with. I wake up everyday thankful that I don't still work there.
bad,I would never work there again. Unprofessional and stressful. Promised training and never received any. No one was ever available to answer questions.
bad,The worst environment I have ever worked in. Politics are incredible. Butt kissing is the only way to stay in.upper management does not have a clue of what's going on. The quality of the product is questionable.  Bunch of amateurs across the board. Was involved with various plants and all are the same. Very poor management and politics
bad,"If you choose to stay, you will be rewarded. If you choose to leave you will never be rehired and treated like a traitor. Choose this company at your own peril."
bad,I worked 3000 plus hours a year and was forced to leave after 11 years in the job.  Very hard place to work. The management are all snakes waiting to get you. It's a miserable place to work.  Worse than being in high school.
bad,Long days every other weekend cover vacation mandatory ot no life people suck back stab nights are better no one there benafits good you get vacation good pay but they closed the plant one day notice thanks for your 30 plus years buy
bad,I notified them that I had confirmation of a 6.5 million dollar order from a customer on a Thursday morning.  This would have been a $250K commission check and then I got let go later that day.
bad,"They are the laziest people ive ever worked for. I was never properly trained because my first supervisor ""didn't feel like training anybody"", my second supervisor tried to find reasons to get people in trouble in fear of that employee taking his position. They worked me 8, 12 hour days in a row, my first week."
bad,work is always busy. I learned how to cook all of the food and what goes on each sandwhich. the management was as usual . the co-workers was nice and worked as a team. the hardest part of the job was not having the food cooked already . the most enjoyable part was not being busy .
bad,"The Weston Plant in Toronto is on strike. If you like crossing a picket line every day this might be the job for you.They have been on strike since Sept 6, 2013. Bad place to work."
bad,"This place sucks, dirty place. Staff and management suck. This had to be the worst job I ever had."
bad,I onloy worked here temporarily but in the time I did it was a decent job. The only thing I have to say is that they put me in a position and didn't instruct me properly as to what to do.
bad,"Terrible management and everyone is on drugs."
bad,Every day you go to work they are talking about closing the doors if you like living at work this is for you if you like second shift that is where you  will be working and dont ever make plans because you will be stuck with over time taht no one else wants they will teach you to do the job one way and don't feel out the paper work the way they train you it is the way they fire you if you dont do a check  leave it blank
bad,"I was trained in PDN by basically someone who never liked training me . She shows you ABC the next will be HXYZ. Never received proper training in both positions,CSR MGR has a communication problem as she never replies on time if she ever. Bigger issues are left unanswered and when you call you leave a message and not return. A girl who was training me left before my training"
bad,No air conditioning which makes working in the summer unbearable. You work HARD for the amount of money you get. People you work with totally suck. You basically go deaf working there even with earplugs. The guys are all creeps. Nobody is nice and they just care about themselves. It's nice because they give you free stuff sometimes and free special nice dinners but for how much they make they could just pay you more.
bad,"I have been with this company over 20 years. Management has always been questionable but never as bad as it is now! They aren't mean or harassing but they do not know anything about what happens on the floor, Some Examples:"
bad,Crown Cork And Seal pays great with free insurance for workers. the management staff are compete idiots. they don't understand that employees have lives outside of work. they expect you to find coverage for mandatory overtime they schedule and if  you ask someone outside your pay grade (who are more than willing to take a pay cut to cover your overtime) they will denied your transfer overtime form. they will wait til the last minute to tell you that its been denied. will switch your shift  your shift a few days in advance and tell you that we have a business to run. without the opportunity to find child care coverage.
bad,There is lots of buddy system and back stabbers don't trust anyone at all it's dirty nasty hot very dangerous and unsafe not clean house keeping is not done very well spills all the time into environment they have been fined for that cover a lot of stuff up I would not drink out of can's made by them there quality is not good at all company's have started to get away from them because they run bad products not safe and unclean
bad,Don't expect to stay in or move up if your not a butt kisser. The managers and team leads are clueless on want actually goes on the production with there employees.
bad,This is the worse company I ever worked in my life management and supervisors don't care about workers they don't understand people's have outside life families they just care about their union people that has been there for over 80 years most people there are over 65 years always talking about seniority and how many years they have working for the company the dosen't care about the new young people that's very sad not recommend this company to work never ever
bad,The place can't stick to the schedule people are always quiting due to the hours so you have to fill there spot resulting in 5 or 6 12 hr days in a row it's 110 degrees in there during the summer. I was written up for missing a day and still worked 50 hrs that wk. They let some people got over there point system and fire others who have the max. They hire old people that cause drama and can't keep up with there work load. Great pay off you don't want to have a life
bad,The hourly personnel earn their pay because leadership is busy covering up their mistakes and don't manage anything. The mission statement is in direct conflict with how they run the plant. The company does pay well and offers great benefits but they really need to work on providing better leadership.
bad,Crown pays good and the benefits are good but trying to advance is a challenge and almost unheard of . They are extremely prejudice and if you're not white your days there are numbered .
bad,Company doesn't care about their workers at all. Stressful work environment because nobody from the front office ever knows what they are doing on a day to day basis especially the plant manager!
bad,"I was promised 6 weeks of training, but received only 2 and was thrown on the job. Given 3rd shift after being told I would be on 2nd. Made time for a nightly coffee break to help me keep alert on the forklift, but then I was written up when I could not keep up with the production schedule. My probationary period was extended 30 days even though I still had a month of the original 60 day period left to go. I then accidentally damaged a palletizer with the forklift. When I questioned the floor manager  about the possible consequences of this, he told me bald faced lies, saying that he did not know what the results would be. I feel that he knew exactly what would be coming my way within the next week. 4 days after the accident, I was terminated from my employment, during the meeting, the accident was specifically mentioned. He is the worst excuse for a manager in the place, not that any of the other management is any better. High and mighty and above all of the lowly employees. In no way could I or would I recommend Crown Cork and Seal to anyone seeking employment. If I could give the company zero stars, I would."
bad,Management doesnt care about you. They will blame anything on workers and refuse to blame poor maintenance of machinery due to their need to run cans no matter what the quality of the machinery is.
bad,"Horrible management, they tell you one thing and turn around and do the opposite. 1 member of management actually got nose to nose with me cussing and screaming because i was helping a coworker. Pay is terrible for the type of work. It’s union, but the union only helps the workers that don’t deserve it, while they throw the good workers under the bus"
bad,"I worked at Crown Cork and Seal's Aurora, IL plant (#058) for fourteen (14) years and felt that it was the best job that I never had in my forty-five years of working for many different firms.  The pay and benefits were decent for my semi-skilled job as a Forklift Driver.  The people were decent also, better than at some of the places I have worked.  The Plant Management treated us fairly, for the most part.  In return, I came to work every day for (14) years and worked as hard as I could for Crown Cork and Seal, Inc."
bad,"I liked working there,but was only acknowledged as a TEMP. They like too keep you as such,which is NO GOOD.They need to make a position for what they need the most: Manual hand quality control."
bad,"15 years with company was very good place to work 10 years ago but since like all companies now cutting jobs and running lean as possible to make environment very stressful and very unorganized, pay is decent but not for a person looking to move up or get any improvement of pay, no pay sick time and definitely not a place for a person with kids or any out of work schedule"
bad,They are really petty about everything and management sucks unless your a man. I liked the job but not the people that work there.  The management is really contradicting like they said I was one of the best workers their but then want to fire me.  Doesn't make sense.  They didn't really give me a reason for firing me either.
bad,The press supervisor has no clue what is going on most of the time. 10-12hr shifts are the norm. Overtime on saturdays is scheduled when there is no need for it. Very short handed mechanics in press department due to high turnaround. New mechanics come in at last about two months and quit because of the exceasive overtime and lack of leadership in management. Pay is decent. Not a place to work if you have a family and enjoy spending time with them. Supervisors will sit in air conditioned office and you might not see them until the end of your shift.
bad,"Enjoyed my role as the Safety and HR role. However, training was very vague when starting in the position. At times, the office environment was very toxic and stressful."
bad,Great benefits but that is the ONLY good thing I am able to say for the plant where I worked.  Is run and controlled by clicks in the plant.  And management runs on cowardice and fear !
bad,"Wanting more out of the employees than they can give. If you want to work 6 days a week for weeks on end, then this is the place for you. And please don't have any accidents, they blame you for them and try to push you out the door."
bad,Job security is very low. You don't know if you'll be working all year or will there be an unplanned shutdown. Company policies are not well thought out.
bad,"Pay is above average, benefits are good. Work and life balance, there is none. Swing shift combined with 12 HR days leaves you tired allthe time after so long. Some cool managers but corporate has the final say. Production seema to be all they care about. Morale very low. I feel like I work in a communist factory."
bad,This was an old fashioned run company where people used to smoke right at their desks.  They ran things in an old fashioned manner and it was very cut throat.
bad,"Stressful environment"
bad,70 hour work weeks are common. The best part about working there is the group of hourly employees that have called that place home over the years. The hardest part is staying positive when the company doesn't show its appreciation or respect for the hard work that its employees preform daily.
bad,Crown Holdings is a stable company that focuses on employee development.
bad,load unload trucks do inventory and office work.how to become a team leader. really learned how to work safe and watch out for hidden hazards.
bad,laid me off three times in 3 years. Management micro menages.
bad,"I worked for Crown for 20 years including 10 1/2 months thru a temp service. They let you hang not knowing from week to week if you will be working there the following week. And they have gotten ride of people for asking about hiring. It's hot in the summer, and colder inside the building than it is outside in the wintertime, but the office area is very comfortable. It is an old building, but simple things to make it warmer in the winter are blantly ignored. Worked 21 turn for most of my time there, then we got a new plant manager and he sweet talked enough people into changing to 12 hour shifts. When people started complaining about the loss of money, he ignored them, them when production went down, he laid off 30 people and fired as many.These were the first lay offs in 16+ years. He installed cameras everywhere and punished people for the simplest things.New hires stood around and played on cell phones all shift and not a word was said. Corporate finally caught up with him and the plant manager ""quit to spend more time with family"" Job security has become a thing of the past. Good money and benefits are decent, but watch your back or you will get knifed."
bad,I would pack goods to be shipped off everyday. Friday monings we would have a meeting with the entire department. I learned to work hard and be on time. Also staying focused at the task at hand.
bad,"Terrible union, only protects bad employees, you can be forced six 14 hr shifts a week and if you don't want to work, then you get fired, okay money.."
bad,"Expect to never make plans. Overtime is frequently mandatory and surprise. Every time you have a meeting praising your dept. achievements, expect another the next day to tell you how poor your dept. is doing."
bad,"If you werent in the ""Good Old Boys"" club you were not able to advance.  Favoritism was rampant and if you needed help you were considered weak. Would never send anyone there."
bad,"I can only write of my own experience, and perhaps of what others have shared with me of their experiences. Overall, I have been unhappy working for Crown for the majority of my employment there, and I am not alone in that. "
bad,"I am not sure if it is all of the plants, but the one I work in is terrible.  I am part of the management team and it is still a joke.  The plant manager shows nobody any respect, but demands that everyone respect him.  Everyone is micromanaged and we are not allowed to make any decisions.  It is like we are high paid babysitters.  If you are looking for a boring job where you are put down constantly, but you get paid well, this is the one for you.  I would gladly work somewhere else for less money.  That is why I am looking after all."
bad,"Could be a good place to work if not for constant feeling of walking on eggshells fearing a write up or getting fired being a minute or 2 late from lunch/break, or running bad product from machines that are 60+ years old and dont get half the maintanace they need, and if they do get it its because you have to put in 60 hours a week to help get it done, not to mention the 60 hours you work all summer long anyway because of people getting fired and they dont replace them for a year or so.dont make plans for family time soon as you do youll be cancelling for even more overtime almost every saturday. Very high turn around rate for such a small company, so dont plan on retiring from there. There are some good people there to work with minus the few tattletells/brown nosers that secretly let upper management know when your doing something wrong. Does pay well and have good benefits however most of the time the stress and loss of family time isnt worth it."
bad,Crown cork and seal is alright by all means. Just poor management and not enough advancement. Union work so be prepared to deal with the union senority rule!
bad,It is your typical Factory job. I've learned how to run a production job and what bad management is like. There are great people there to work with but the hardest part of the job is having to deal with all the last min changes that you have to deal with that will effect your personal life.
bad,Okay job for older people who want alot of hours have medical bills and dont want time off. You only get 1 week vacation AFTER working a year. No personal or sick days. Call offs are a point system so you can use that if you want to get points. Over time is a must because you work 12 hour shifts. They wont tell you any of this in the interview or even after you are hired. The only good thing about crown is the people and company paid health insurance.  In a 12 hr shift you get 3 20 min breaks.
bad,Again.. Great place to earn a living and pay all your bills. Just don't get sick or hurt or they will outcast you. Their problems stem from within the office and leach to the work floor.
bad,"I enjoyed my job, but the senior managment couldnt see eye to eye.  This created a bad atmosphere and total chaos at times.  This job was also very demanding."
bad,"I used to like working here but was frustrated with not being able to advance. You never knew when the next wave of layoffs were coming and when it did, I saw people who worked hard and had value to the company get laid off while others who literally do nothing day to day are allowed to ride out there retirement. Definitely favoritism going on at the Alsip R&D location. Most of Management were always trying to get noticed one way or another and coming up with goofy ideas which was frustrating to staff and it usaually turned into a circus. Company loyalty surely does not exist here."
bad,My job with Crown Cork and Seal has taught me a lot about work in a machine shop. A typical day includes performing standard company checks and helping out in other departments.
bad,"We worked 4. 12 hour days each week. Most of the managers were very friendly and helpful. Some of the workers were not team oriented and quite frankly were less than truthful on several occasions, which made working there stressful. I was hired as a machinist, which was misleading. I was put on a production stamping machine, I was expected to know how to repair with little experience on one."
good,Job is fair.long hours.no family time.management needs help.maintenance staff is poor.salary is fair for start up job.very fast paced environment.understaffed
good,Not family oriented. All about almighty dollar. Company does not care about emplyees. A union job and union will not take care of you. I got cheated out of my job. I wouldn't recommend working here. The employees on the floor where fun to work with
good,"Working as the Parts Inventory Manager I learned quite a lot about the importance of keeping proper stock of machine parts and accessories, dealing with vendors to get the best delivery and pricing for items bought, and prioritizing assignments to keep all projects on schedule."
good,As a manager 12hr days resulted in 14hr days with a rotating shift with mandatory extra days to cover other managers.  Roles were stretched.
good,I worked here for a short period of time and could not stand it any longer. In the production area you will do the exact same thing for the 10 hours that you are there. The manage does not have a clue what is actually going on on the production floor. They walk around just to try and catch people off task. The job is producing cans for food but cleaning the warehouse is the very last thing on the agenda for them and people would get in trouble for cleaning if they had five minutes of down time. This place is only for the people that have no other option and can handle the monotony of doing the exact same thing over and over all day every day. 
good,"Extremely pro company, unwilling to work with employees at almost any level. Work every holiday, poor parking regular forced overtime,  write ups abound"
good,"After management changed, went downhill. Was a better job when I started. Lots of overtime, much of it unscheduled but mandatory.  Flawed attendance point system. Consistent work, much of which is underappreciated."
good,"Same people in the same roles forever,  impossible to change the culture,  employees are clannish. no investment in people or technology.  not receptive to change"
good,"I worked on a press that made lids, about 1800 per minute. I had to also work on the bagger & robot . And check completed pallets for shipping. If any of those machines were not running or specs were not in I had to get back up and running properly."
good,"there is no structure and 75 percent of jobs are unsafe"
good,"great place to start off, after crown everywhere else you work will seem amazing. everyone is in a bad mood due to understaffed workforce. the management changes all the time. some are great some are terrible."
good,What they say and what happens are two different things.  it's a 2-2-3 schedule but more like a 8 on 1 off 9 on 2 off schedule.  Sometimes you're asked to come in on days when you work nights to cover.
good,"Manufacturing of beverage cans is rough, hazardous work in the least and it is a high pressure and fast production environment during the best of days.  The working environment is noisy, hazardous, and physically demanding.  The best way to describe the work culture is simply ""Get-R-Done"" and get it done at all costs.  For me the hardest part of the job was just simply trying to keep up as at least 5 miles of constant walking was required and sometimes I clocked in over 16 miles, and this was done to maintain the machines, keep them moving, and preforming the hourly quality control checks.  Finally there was my dealing with the lacquer fumes which I believe put me in the hospital less than a year later with a collapsed lung after quitting.  If you can do the work and are in excellent health the pay is quite good and there is some room for advancement.  You have to be a serious team player as everyone really does depend upon each other to keep things running smoothly as the manufacturing line is FAST and there is little room for errors or breakdowns."
good,"first real job for me. money was good at the time. worked a lot of hours, but i was young. working conditions were ok, but loved the coworkers i worked with."
good,"conditions are tough pay is not to bad and company is running very strong, just not much room for advancement there. Good place to learn valuable experience at but not a place you would like to retire from"
good,Typical Day at Work
good,"The job isn't that bad. What makes it bad is the management that runs the shifts. On third the manager doesn't know what we are running half the time. They talk about taking the time to fix the machines, but also worry about production. They don't worry about family time, because they don't give you personal or sick time off. They only have a point system consist of 5 points, but within those points if you use 3.5 you get suspended for 3 days. Overall job isn't that bad but when it comes to benefits they don't have the best. When it comes to on the job training the give you an outline of what you have to know, but you have to make the time to learn because they don't give you the time that you need within your shift to learn everything."
good,"The Job had been a good place to work for many years. The management likes to promote within and this is good for advancement, to a point. The job is stressful because of them always changing work schedules."
good,machines are very dirty and hard to work on as they are over 40yrs old. they hire people for a specific job even if they are not qualified and then terminate them at 90 days
good,Different positions are ok....leadmen suck....too hot and dirty in the summer...they tend to overwork new hires or lower seniority personal...lack of communication overall
good,Top management have no respect or appreciation for their loyal lower management employees and also some hourly. This has caused the loss of highly skilled and devoted lower management to loss their jobs or forced to quit because of false finger pointing. This is the result of their poor people skills and the failure to prove they are competent in their high management positions.
good,"Lots of lazy workers who take advantage of our breaks, some come into work smelling like they have been at the bar all night or all day. Employees who have been with the company the longest are generally the ones to abuse breaks, behave rudely and aggressive towards new employees. Everyone acts above their pay grade and management does nothing about everything going on."
good,"A typical day at work, clock in 6:15 to relieve crew. Talk with other crew member about things that have been done, look over everything to make sure it is done for quality inspection. Management lacks leadership, and training. Do not care about their employees."
good,"come in check with jobs to run check quality running in lines,"
good,"I knew going into this job that it was only a summer position. The pay was what drew me in. The job was way different than any other job I've ever done. Standing on my feet in one spot, sliding pop can lids into paper sleeves for 12 hours, got long. The hardest part was working the night shifts. It was difficult to switch my sleeping schedule from nights to days. I learned to appreciate the people that are willing to work in places like that for years until they retire. The co-workers were wonderful! They were always telling me they were happy to hear that I was going to college to better my future so I wouldn't have to work in a factory forever. Even though I wasn't a fan of the job I was always optimistic that all this hard work will pay off. My Pa always says, ""Its good to have your wants because then you'll work for them."""
good,"Our plant was open for over 40 years, but when a new management team was brought in, they ran our plant into the ground. After two year of not meeting our goals we were shut down."
good,"easy work.great benefits.. deceitful- vindictive-discriminatory and just plan no management that are helpful,.Except a couple. Paid holidays but you are forced to work them. Days off   but you are forced to work them . you can not make any plans ."
good,"One year before my planned retirement when I was one month to 65 years old and disabled, they just got rid of me after I worked there for total of 13+ years."
good,It is a steady job with benefits.  I left automotive to gain the benefits but I am not much on running the equipment as much as I would rather be turning wrenches.  Most of the time is spent operating the equipment and running quality checks.  One will make good money if the schedule works for them.
good,"Poor place to work if you want to plan ANYTHING in your life."
good,The job is a great job.  I would recommend the company for anyone who wants a career in a can company.  The company will help you build skills needed to succeed and will promote from within.  I enjoy working for them
good,"relaxed atmosphere nothing to be stressed out get there do your work and clean up if there is a mess, work as a team as needed. be punctual to do your job."
good,"Depending on what job you are working, the work can either be easy or more challenging. The company is willing to train people with limited or no experience. Opportunity for upward mobility and higher pay based on seniority. Voluntary overtime sometimes available and varying amounts of mandatory overtime. Exceptional upper management and office employees. Poor workplace culture on the factory floor. Lax enforcement of company policies and supervisor's authority not acknowledged or respected by the majority of production workers. The hardest part of the job is the sometimes alternating shifts and limited ability to plan anything outside of work. Most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity for upward mobility and to learn new skills/jobs."
good,Management could be more involved in the day to day. They do not show much attention to detail. Work life balance is above average but you are constantly harrased at home
good,"I worked at crown for four years. It has always been very hot and noisy inside the plant. The quality of training an employee receives is highly depending on the supervisior that a person gets put under. Most of the management at crown are new due to the constant changes in plant manager, therefore most of the lower management know little about the can making process. There are great pay and benefits at crown for an employee and family members but a very high pace cut throat environment"
good,"Union shop. The management was a good, solid management team, but the Union was so combative with them that the atmosphere was always nervous and tense."
good,It has its positives and negatives . But if you have a great work ethic you will be ok. Benefits are pretty good its long hours but a close nit family type of atmosphere. Constant communication
good,it was only a temporary job. provided great hours for a short amount of time. started working with the company through a temporary work service called ManPower.
good,Boa chefia boa organização bom ambiente de trabalho refeitório barato regras de higiene boas
good,"Enjoyable, technical, lots of engineering challenges and projects, good management, in process of renovating, technology wise is average"
good,"most days were good productive days. fast paced environment, changing from one job order to another, in a fast safely manner. co-worker helped to keep orders on track."
good,"6am-6pm  quality always had to be perfect to meet customers needs .employees need to comunicate better .bosses have there favorite people.high stress job ,good insurance,pay is ok Istarted at machine operator & worked my way up.lots of paper work."
good,"The job is physically strenuous. It is dirty and loud. They wear ear plugs that block out sounds, including the human voice. The plant runs continuously and newbies are expected to pick it up on the fly without production stoppages. One of the bosses is a bully and will pressure his employees to bypass safety protocols, whip tools, and scream obscenities. He will retaliate against dissenters and support the bad behavior of his favorites. In the summer it can reach 110 degrees and break times are *limited.*"
good,Crown cork & seal is a very demanding place to work.  Also very fast paced with very little room for error.  But with that Crown has excellent benefits.
good,"They compensate very well for the work they expect, but trying to balance life with this job is nearly impossible. Just to work here is a sacrifice that someone with a family might want to think hard about. You're advertised work schedule is rarely the case."
good,The management needs to hire people with good educational background. I have seen people working here on the basis of experience and lacking a great deal of communication and educational skills.
good,"I loved my job there. I was always busy and doing the work of 2 people.It was a pretty clickie place, which is a big down fall. It should be team work.Then not having enough people at the palatizer, so the forklift drivers would need to their jobs on top of their own. It was extremely stressful."
good,The work was not excessively hard physically or mentally.  It was challenging enough to make the job interesting.  The pay was good and people were intelligent my bosses were friendly and professional.
good,"Crown Cork and Seal Toledo has an easy, laid-back atmosphere. Everyone generally gets along, including management. The place almost has a mom and pop feel to it even though Crown is a multi-billion dollar company. Crown offers a pension plan after four years of service, and after two years hourly employees are eligible for sub-pay when they get laid off."
good,Crown is not a bad place to work but it could be so much better. Management is very old school and does not look for new or better solutions. Many of the employees do not feel like their jobs are secure.
good,"typical day  was keeping all 18 plus the cupper machines running what i learned how to read alerts coil changes and maintain order management was very good ,co-workers some were good some was not so good,hardest of the job 12hour shifts and rotating shifts the enjoyable part of my job was the four days on four days off."
good,"Work shifts are 6am-6pm and switch every 8 weeks."
good,"12 Hour shifts, four by four, 4 half hour breaks, the supervisors are really nice and get along well with the workers, the hardest part of the job is the hours of standing (for me), the enjoyable part of the job is the paycheck ever week"
good,"I start work at crown in the ends department. Then move to the cans side where I became a cans sorter."
good,12 hour day as a printer operator it’s a very stressful job but I really enjoyed it. A lot of detail goes into the product and the whole process. Great people worked here
good,"My typical day at work was a 12hr swing shift with a rotating schedule . My Plant was a 24hr facility and ran non stop . Management left much to be desired and moral was very low due to the non communication and mismanagement of the facility . I was a line mechanic my duties were to keep the line running if something would break then it was my duty to fix and maintain the line to get it back up and running . I performed many repairs to motors, Conveyors (Sentry), power press repairs , QA qualifications of finished product , inventory management , Fabricating Parts (if non is available), Training of operators, and many more duties. The hardest part of the Job was dealing with non communication between the floor and the office most things were not discussed to floor personnel which made it very hard to complete the tasks at hand."
good,"I have been an excellent worker , very loyal and dedicated as I always am with all of my prior employers. There is a misunderstanding with the HR department, the new employee that was hired was very neglectful and didn't not honor the company policy for explanation of medical visits, nor was she compassionate with the employees."

good,Otimo sitio para trabalho. Recomendo a qualquer pessoa !
good,Crown Cork & Seal offers a lot of different positions. To me this helps all new employees the chance to bid up to higher paying positions and learning different parts of the can making operation. You start out in packaging and the top position is an Electrician. Some of the skilled groups require hours of progression with a review before you receive a raise and get credit for your hours.

good,"typical day would be to come in check specs on the four body maker machines that you was assigned. Then after checking specs you check your air pressures make sure regulators, air bags, etc. was all in spec and working properly. If anything was out of spec or there was any other issues with the machine you would then start your trouble shooting and fix the issue."
good,The work is not bad and they definitely allow for overtime. The work grows tedious and boring. Good to make a friend and help time go by quicker. Make it through the initial weeding out process and you are good.

good,"This was a long time ago, but working at Crown offered new challenges that were intriguing to me at the time, maintenance machining and tool and die repair. The temperature often rose over 100 degrees in the building and major explosion resulting  in the death of one employee and permeant physical impairment to another lead to my seeking new employment."

good,Good pay. Great benefits. Extremely loud on the floor. Good people. Very hot on the floor too. Management is okay. Just about like any other production place. The vacation isn't very good. Takes 4 years to get 2 weeks & you have to take a week at a time. No individual days. No sick days.
good,"I was with Crown for about 3 years and it truly opened my eyes to what engineering and manufacturing is like, almost like a culture shock. It was my first industry job out of college, but I started as a paid co-op with them during my second year earning my associates degree. So in the beginning my work/life balance was a little hectic since I was balancing full time work and school with an hour (one way) commute Monday-Friday. Once I graduated with my 2 year degree i was given an informal offer that turned into a full time salaried position on their corporate engineering team as a Drafting Technician which would turn into a proper engineer after some training was completed. The people I came to know truly invested whatever they could into my future to develop a strong work ethic and an attention to detail. While the management was a bit hard nosed, it was mostly due to the potential they knew i had and could achieve. My most enjoyable experience in the job was traveling to our different locations in the US to assist in their improvement processes, The most ""difficult"" part of this position was trying to help them update their engineering process they had been doing for the past 40 years. They were open (enough) to hear e out, but a little slow on the draw to commit to any real improvement. Overall I truly enjoyed working for this company and would recommend them to any one looking for an experience."
good,"typically troubleshoot and repair plant equipment to keep things running in a production facility, fast paced , very hot environment, benefits are good , employees work together"

Was production supervisor for 1.5 years before being approached and offered a job as the QA Manager at the same plant.  Experience in QA Manager role was fun and exciting work, never a dull moment."
good,"Crown Cork and Seal is overall a good place to work.  I work 12 hour shifts generally from 7 pm to 7 am, 3 or 4 days a week.  At Crown I've improved my mechanical abilities, and enjoy working as a team with my shift."

She gave me a lot more tasks to do including handling mill claims, writing and updating standard operating procedures (SOP), inspecting all HFI products, audits and calibrating the gauges on an as needed basis. I went from work 40 hours a week to 60 hours a week and I loved every minute of it. I had a lot of responsibility and even though it was very stressful at times I loved the people that I worked with and I loved my bosses.
