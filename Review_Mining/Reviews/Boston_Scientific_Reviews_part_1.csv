rating,review
bad,"This company is a joke, it talks a good game however The management is awe full . And if you have a problem and go to HR the managers will know before you go back downstairs . I would recommend Burger King before Boston Scientific . Stay away from joke of a company. And if you don’t you take your safety in your own hands."
bad,"This place is a revolving door, don't waste your time.  I was treated better on black Friday working retail then I was here.  I moved on to save my sanity!"
bad,Do not applied to work at Boston Scientific. They BS- fault advertisement. Applied for full time. Two weeks out they offer me contract position. Sued.
bad,The job actually wasn’t hard. But I hate factory work and did not enjoy it at all. I only applied to work here cuz I was new in the area and my family that have worked there told me that they were always hiring and most people got the job
bad,"If you need money and love working 24/7 to be in the same position 15 years down, then this is the right place for you. Enjoy that max of 25 cents a year raise. Within that year they can count anything towards your review."
bad,A typical day involves getting results as soon as possible of the local and external sites.  The work was overwhelming for a small group of people to handle.
bad,Very bad and unfriendly environment.  The management and the Human Resources  are horrible and hard to deal with.   The hardest part of the job was dealing with a very unfriendly supervisor who never appreciate anything you do and  love to say nasty words and bring down people.
bad,"I worked at this company for over a year, helped make them thousands of dollars and put in countless hours away from my family. The level of stress and disrespect from sales reps is unbelievable. Your treated completely unfair for your hard work. I felt very used and disrespected. Management only cares about profit and your treated as a tool to them not a human being. The level of micromanagment and narcissism is sickening. I was never thanked or appreciated for the hard work I did when I left. I felt I was more told to not let the door hit me on the way out..."
bad,"You are timed by a timer overhead where every one can see.  Each station has a timer, a big one, above your head, with a set goal for each hour, if you don't make that goal, you have to explain and they will let you go right on the spot in front of everyone if you don't make that number.  They don't care about you, just the number of product.  It is so fast paced, too many mistakes happen because they want you to go so fast.  People get hurt, machines break down when going to fast. Co-workers from other stations are yelling at you to hurry up.  The crew leads are intimitading, and so are the managers.  The breaks are ridulucous, there is a timer for that too.  You can't be late!  They will fire you for that too!  The short amount of time I worked there, so much turn over and people walking off the job!"
bad,"Awful company to work for, particularly for Quality. Sexist environment with bad benefits and salary. The fight for survival is not worth it for the sake of your mental health. HR is not helpful when dealing with tough situations and management bully you into completing projects poorly just to meet unrealistic deadlines. Full of politics."
bad,"Company has taken immediately action to close all the job position from india and windup the division, which launch just before 1 year, so all the candidate now job less."
bad,"Common knowledge about one's position is not permitted to be shared. horrible environment."
bad,Management suck. They favor certain people and blame other for their mistakes. Supervisors are stupid and cannot make decisions on their own. They blame production coordinators for not doing their job well when they fail to train them properly. Nothing is being done and the lean specialist is lazy. A lot of people are leaving because management does not care about their builders. They don't reward builders for their hard work and they don't take the time to build relationships at all. Overall do not work at machining and metals. They say they'll get back to us but at the end we have to wait and remind them again. Very poor!!
bad,"Modern day slavery there, lots of over time, no time for family, always mandatory overtime on Saturday sometimes sunday. Everything is fast pace and stressful"
bad,"All managers and Employees in IT work EVERY WEEKEND an average of ~4 hrs/Week "
bad,"THE WORST place I have ever worked!! I had the misfortune of working in Boston Scientific Cork through an agency as a product builder for 2 years. From the moment we started we were treated like second class citizens because we were agency workers. We were always pushed harder than the full time employees. We were expected,not asked, to do overtime. From the moment you got in, they would work you to the bone, and even then they still weren't happy! The daily and hourly targets were ridiculously high, and the work environment was horrible. Claustrophobic clean rooms with no natural light 8 hours a day. We had the luxury of a radio no one could ever hear. The work was incredibly monotonous, but worst of all were the senior staff. We were looked down on, and made to feel bout 2 feet tall. We weren't allowed talk to each other even as we worked. I remember thinking, I would have had a better life in prison."
bad,"they claim to family friendly.  in reality they are not. push you into working almost every weekend after working overtime all week. they do not work with your schedule "
bad,Unfair treatment favoritism ...One of Supervisor doesn't even know you yet will judge you they can easily lay you off so unfair even you work hard....
bad,Internal politics and system manipulation are the keys to your success.  Performance and productivity mean little compared to who you know.   Marketing approach is consistent with character.
bad,They are slave drivers with no care in the world. Things are changing everyday. Your not even allowed to sit down . management doesn't care about anything but their computers.
bad,expected to work 6 of 7 days a week/10 hours a day.  Supervisors rarely were on the floor.  Too many hours; considered disposable labor.
bad,Company management does not care about its employees. They live by the mantra that everyone is replaceable! One field reps was expected to miss his child's birth to cover a case!!!
bad,"Never before have I worked for such an awful, unprofessional and unorganised company."
bad,"The job was not long enough for me to give a typical day."
bad,"The hourly employees work hard and try to do the best they can despite incompetent management.  Spencer plant managers have no concern for hourly or floor salary employees.  If you can say ""yes"" to what ever is asked of you and turn a blind eye to lack of integrity then you might go far.  Always be aware of your backside."
bad,I have had the misfortune of working in Boston scientific.The staff are friendly but the management are rude and completely incompetent.Most product builders are looking for a way out. The culture potrayed by Boston is completely  opposite to what it is .Financial awards that staff once got were removed .The bonus is now much harder achieve .Any way they can save money at your expense.Avoid at all cost.
bad,"There's definitely a ""one of us"" type culture.  If you aren't exactly like the people that have been there a long time, you'll never fit in or get a fair chance.  Performance reviews are almost exclusively focused on how well you conform to unwritten rules."
bad,"Empresa muy inestable, trabajan a la antigua y las personas son traicioneras. Si no está dentro de la argolla no funciona. A los 5 meses lo despiden."
bad,Boston Scientific is a buddy system place if you are not in the click then they try to get you fired. The Engineering staff is terrible. Just a bunch of over educated kids.
bad,"Upon returning after almost ten years of being employed temporarily, there was an utmost urgency to seal a position as an employee of the company named Boston Scientific. Unfortunately they don't hire low level employees. They just let them fight among themselves whom strive to be the laziest."
bad,"Sadly, this company has no sense of life/work balance.  There is a huge turnover for builders that cannot make plans for their weekends and are given grief even for necessary absences.  People are worked to the breaking point.  Management is young engineers with no experience and no management skills.  It was degrading for older mature adults to work in these conditions.  "
bad,"Long days, followed by long nights and weekends of studying to prepare for endless training modules, competency test, and national certification.  Call on rotating weekends.  "
bad,Boston Scientific does not care much about its employees.  Its focus is their bottom line.  If you are being mistreated and report it you will be shown the door.
bad,"They'll train you to death on rules, regulations, and processes which is perfectly fine, but once you get on the production line it's a new story. Everyone is breaking rules to meet goals and not following procedure and if you don't keep up then you get warned over and over and talked to. Supervisors are horrible and talk down to you. The list goes on and on. This is for the MG location NGT"
bad,"The company does not care about you. It prefers African immigrants who will succumb to Boston's high demands for low pay. 13.13 an hour, repetitive tasks and if you don't speak Swahili or Arabic, your an outsider."
bad,"I was hired to work thru a temp agency. In the 2 day orientation, they explained it would be mon-fti 40 hours a week with the possibility of overtime if you want it. "
bad,Not too far from home. A lot of thing to learn in different lines. Cleanroom environment. Room for growth. Worked a lot of hours. A lot of overtime.
bad,"The senior leadership team are very down to earth, the Middle management team are aggressive, and unapproachable to all those beneath them. There is an awful atmosphere. People do not want to help one another. Customer services are seen as beneath everyone, therefore are treated with no respect. There is a lot of bullying and HR sweep under the carpet. Lots of settlements  are made because of poor relationships."
bad,An awful place to work. Money was meek and the workload of general individuals depends on whether you are connected to lead ops and managers. Social exclusion and a disregard for regulatory obligation via the policy of cutting corners throughtout their front end assembly operations in the name of efficiency and a further blacklisting of employees who attempted to question this policy was prevailent throughtout Boston during my time there.
bad,"Very poor management and leadership. Environment is all about competing. Very poor benefits, can't even use in some states. High deductible for medical. They don't lay off but rather pressure you to quit to avoid unemployment cost. Not a company that you expect."
bad,I really enjoy helping others my job at Boston was really pleasant .
bad,"When this job was a company they treated their employees right, but then they became corporate and got a high turnover rate. Most of us left. A lot of the employees went to another medical device company to get better treatment and respect.8"
bad,Work you like a dog for a pittance. Terrible management where being a snake or better yet a spineless worm is rewarded. Make your way up the ladder on the still warm corpses of your coworkers.  Sixty hours a week is normal. Management doesn't care. They'll cripple you with numbers and processes. Take away staff and demand more.
bad,"The company is a great place to work for someone who is single. Working there if you have a family would support them, but you would have little time with them."
bad,"This is the worst place I have ever worked! I think I literally have PTSD from it. I know more than one person who had to go on disability for stress because of this place. Don't do it! Run the other way as fast as you can. And heads up, they do no like to hire anyone permanent anymore. They will work you until your 6 months or year is up, whatever it is, and then they will lay you off. That way they don,t have to pay you sick days or vacation time or anything."
bad,"Management was/is unstable with constant change in leadership.  Managers and supervisors do not invest in building morale, improving operational practices or advancing the careers of their staff.  Instead, blatant biases are employed which lead to unethical decisions (arbitrary job assignments, inconsistent performance expectations) and business practices (such as quantity over quality). The department could benefit from a manager who makes decisions based on professional merit and not personal gain or preferences. If there was tension or conflict among managers/supervisors, it often rippled out towards the rest of the staff.  The environment is volatile.  Several employees have left or are leaving."
bad,This job started way to early you worked 12 hour shifts and allot of weekends. Got to the point I wasn't having any kind of time for kids so wasn't the best company to work for
bad,"Great place for competitive people to succeed. Very cut throat.  Daily goals were assigned.  Sadly, it was too stressful and unfair for me so I had to leave the job."
bad,"There was no reward for achievements and very little room for advancement.  Employees were on-call 24/7 for weeks at a time, with no compensation.  Employees met with management regularly to discuss issues/problems, to no avail."
bad,"100% forget Work life balance."
bad,"•	Changed safety and quality procedures / policies resulting in a 30% reduction in safety related incidences and 22% improvement in first passed yield.  "
bad,"Liberian managers Hate you if you are not Hmong or Liberian. They force White employees to quit or fire them on fake charges....If someone doesn't like you on their line, they will LIE about you to get you fired or moved. It is a clown house. I would die before using a BSC product. I have never been treated so badly in my life as I was there. I once cared about people from other countries but after enduring the racism here, I care zero about them."
bad,"Very hard place to work but good for clock-watchers and folks, who like to get paid for doing very little work. People are very arrogant, judgmental, and the place is full of demagogs who like meetings but don't like to do anything. I worked there twice, once ten years ago when the stock was at 50+ and most recently when the stock was at 5."
bad,When assembling the parts for Boston Scientific I always felt rushed and that my work was rushed. I always second guessed my work. I was timed a lot. being there made me feel WORTHLESS.
bad,Management need to be change. workplace culture need to be change as well. Finance is great pay. Absolutely not coming back or recommend anyone . Very stressful environment.
bad,"Horrendous workloads"
bad,"The company is mostly made up of people that really would like to leave, but don't, simply because the benefits are good.  The overall environment is cut-throat (especially in the manufacturing area).  Engineers in these areas are predominately looking for their own glory and nothing else."
bad,"This company would be the perfect place to work if management wasn't so isolated from the workforce.  The fact that they use temps, extend the temps beyond the initially agreed upon contract, and then hire less than %10 of the temps to work as a permanent hire, completely separates the decision makers from the culture of the workplace."
bad,Great Temp agency to work for. Short assignment but very helpful in placing another assignment. Very helpful finding a great position that works with your schedule
bad,Do not work here if you have any respect for yourself . The pay is great but the way the managers speak to you and other employees will agitate you to no end between the yelling or talking down to you I don't believe any one will put up with it for too long they fire employees at the drop of a hat with no real explanation or any warning definitely not the job you want to depend on
bad,Mandatory overtime most days/weeks. Very long days and weeks due to the overtime. Production is fast paced and stringent. Somewhat difficult to advance in the company.
bad,"No dan el entrenamiento como es "
bad,slechte firma...uitbuiting van.uitzendkrachten...de oudere
bad,"Boston has a great anti bullying/harassment policy... however they do NOT enforce it. No matter how much proof, evidence and times you complain they will turn their head and play opossum."
bad,Very hard place to work for. The management had there favorites and it was very hard to compete with that. People where very mean and the only time they where nice  is when they wanted something. That is one place I would never go back to.
bad,a good company to work for the only problem is that they treated me like I have no brains. the trainer swore at me and they did nothing about it. he used foul language and he got away with it. no one should be treated like this.
bad,"help each other if who ever finishes their job first, always ask for help and know how to have fun! boss seems to be favoritism which i don't see that to be fair because he should treat everyone equally. working there was relax, fun and sometimes work can be slow and boring."
bad,"Treats hourly employees horribly!"
bad,"Very  stressful work environment.  Those who has been there, don't want to go back.  Recently someone who use to work with me in Boston Scientific told me that he heard that they are getting better but he will never go back there again."
bad,"Couldn't make a decision for 2 years and then everything had to be completed overnight."
bad,company doesn't appreciate the little people and management is a mess. working for a company that forces you to work overtime 7 days straight and they don't care for your health. ALSO the pay is not worth the stuff you deal with.
bad,Early start and worked on the same step for 8 hours a day 5 days Monday to Friday.Supervisor was an absolute tool who was always sneering at us from a distance checking numbers constantly and generally unhelpful to say the least.If there had been cross training it would have improved morale but this was not an option for us as agency workers(ICE) another shower of bloodsuckers.
bad,"Better off starting there now then trying to advance in your current job if you already work there.  "
bad,"Have been assigned the task of covering multiple positions on an off shift and being ignored as if not there; Tasks from maintenance to engineering, management and production. The management does not recognize that many hats are being worn. Production would stop if I had the attitude of my co-workers (That is not my job). Thank You a day or two later gets old and has gotten old for them also. I like to stay busy and learn quickly,"
bad,"A very slow place to work, sometimes we would sit for hours one the computer because there was no work to do, and when we did get work it wasn't consistent."
bad,A company where if a family member is in any form of management you move up quick. If you dont speak up you move up. If you go drinking with your boss you move up. If you become their friend and hang out with them at work or outside work you move up if you run and tattle you move up . It is not a how hard do i work it the less you do the better chance you have to move up
bad,"If you just want to do a good job and go home, forget about it.  If you want to play minesweeper with your job or career, that's the place for you.  They don't practice what they preach."
bad,I do not like of culture's company in Brazil. Some managers helps specific people (friends). The workplace is competitive and the hardest part of job was the poor salary.
bad,"I've been working in Cork site for over 10 years, and it's been the worst 10 years of my life. The Only good thing about the job is decent salary, but the culture and management is very bad."
bad,"Most of the employees and management were easy to get along with.  I learned from experience on the production floor and administrative office work.  Learned team work skills, quality control, attention to detail and dealing with multiple tasks."
bad,The workplace is boring and long.  Always doing the same things everyday.  There are not enough challenge in the area.  The people don't work together as a team
bad,this place is really about who you work for and who you work with. I had the misfortune to work with some people who felt they had control of departments they had no control over and would manipulate people and data to get people fired.
bad,I enjoyed my coworkers and the position I filled. Unfortunately exceedingly poor management choices resulted in yearly layoffs.  The upper division management never encountered a problem which couldn't be solved by adding another person to report to.
bad,"Combative, groups pitted against each other, senior Information Systems leadership runs it like a consulting company - burns out people. It's a great place if you are looking to grow and develop your skills because you are thrown right into the fire. However, if you (like me), need some semblance of a work-life balance, Boston Scientific Information Systems is not a good fit."
bad,"In a climate where medical advances in technology provide all kinds of new alternatives for patients, it is more important now than ever that companies put the interests of the patient first and work with doctors to figure out the best options for patients regardless of the bottom line. While BSC says that their innovation is focused on patient care, their sales model is not at all focused on what's best for the patient. Patients were fitted with devices that the clinical salespeople knew were not going to benefit patients yet they lied to doctors and to patients causing people to get their hopes up and undergo unnecessary surgery. Tons of money spent on national sales meetings and trainings, and all of that at the cost of the patient."
bad,The management at Boston Scientific is terrible. Other employees are great to get along with. Everybody seems scared to talk or say anything because they might offend somebody. Management will lie and manipulate anything they can to benefit themselves. The diversity is only friends of management. There is a lot of favorites at this company.
bad,"short breaks. you have to wear gown, booties, hair net, all the clean room stuff. Supervisors are very prejudiced. Mostly immigrants that work there and they don't like white people."
bad,"Management is terrible. They cannot keep people there working, people are always quitting, they do not pay enough for the toll that the work takes on your body. They do not allow people to sit down due to the fact that you are standing all day. Breaks are staggered and unreasonably early for no reason. Accusing people of other's mistakes without taking full accountability of getting full evidence. Overall bad place."
bad,"Management and money rule here.  If you like following and doing anything that your manager says this is the place for you.  But if you have ideas of your own and do not believe your manager is always right, stay away at all costs.  It will be a VERY caustic environment for this type of personality.  This is a manager's heaven and a practicing engineer nightmare.  Huge turnover.  1-2 years is normal in the area I was in.  "
bad,I worked for BSCI as a Neuromodulation Territory Account Manager. Sales management expects you to coerce chronic pain patients to trial their spinal cord stimulator whether the patient is a good candidate or not.  Very unethical company.  Unless your willing to sell your soul... steer clear!
bad,"ok place to start your career. I really dont want to say anymore. for reals, I dont want to say anymore. come on. give me a break. I only want to apply for a job and move on with my life"
bad,job work/life balance is the most important thing for an employee to be able to perform and give 100% to the company. this is not existing with Boston Scientific as the job demands extensive travelling and many times over the weekend which affect life balance directly and decreases the moral to perform better at the tasks on hand
bad,"If you are talented, don't work here. Advancement opportunities are not merit/skill/contribution based, but instead, whether hiring managers like you. Retribution is a stated cultural no-no, but practiced by management in various forms and ways."
bad,I worked for Boston Scientific/SMART for a little bit over 2 years.  It was a small start up  company and not managed very efficiently and the SMART company was sold to Boston Scientific.
bad,"I was hired into product development with good compensation, and very good hours.  Once the project was completed I was required to completely change my hours and forced to work weekends and excessive hours without regard to my needs.  Management provided little to no direction as to assigned responsibilities  and most of the time I found my own work. There is a drive to support ""clubs"" that recognize LGBT, and other ethnic groups.   The irony is that they want to project being LGBT friendly until it involves supporting that community.  I stayed for the money.  The business supports a ""good 'ol boy"" attitude and the HR department fails to effectively investigate any conflicts."
bad,"would not go back supervisor not honest . I  don't care to talk about this company or give them a rating, I think they were unfair ,pointing fingers at each other rather than just telling the true"
bad,I would rather not comment on my work experience at Boston Scientific.
bad,"working all evenings was hard,worked with a good team.customer service was key."
bad,"Makes great products at the expense of integrity.  Promotes leaders that are willing to do what is asked, not allowed to use own ideas or speak up."
bad,"Hours were great for me at the time, fast paced. Management was not all the great and some of the druggies who worked there."
bad,"the hardest partof the job-rework catheders,the most enjoyable part of the job-finisch,testing final assembly"
bad,"very poor management, degrees doesnt defines level of intelligence. just your level of obedience. no matter how much experience you have in your field it doesnt matter. great benefits if your looking for benefits, but the Distribution Center is falling apart."
bad,Friendly place to work management professional.Clean Self starting jobs Nice cafeteria Interesting  Learned how to buff parts Very enjoyable place Started work at seven am off at three thirty unless over time Nice cafeteria good food
bad,"Que dire ? J'aurai aimé pouvoir y rester, mais la stratégie globale de l'entreprise a eu raison de mon poste. Au niveau local, très bonne communication entre employés.. Au niveau international c'est autre chose... ;)"
bad,Siempre empiezas trabajando por una agencia de empleo a $11 la hora y los empleados regulares por la compañía a $15. Te exigen el mismo rendimiento y trabajo por menos dinero y no te hacen permanente hasta 6 o 7 meses.
bad,"The work is easy the shop is nice the machines are nice but not kept up, if you have no or just a little experience they will train you enough to do your job. The machine shop is only about six years old and the management does not know anything about a machine shop."
bad,"Everything is quantity over quality. Everyday is a request of a unreasonable  goal. If you don't reach it, you're basically interrogated. Quality should and is preached as the number one but it's not. There are more trainee's than trainers are (by policy) allowed to have. Half the time they're just throwing people anywhere expecting them to know how to function in an area they have not been trained in. As a pass employee, I've had my trainer tell me in my face that he didn't care for training. The only reason he wanted to be a ""trainer"" was for the pay. My supervisor was well aware of that fact and yet as trainee's, we get kicked in the dirt if we don't pass our tests."
bad,"Worked as a product builder part time "
bad,"Everything was awesome untill they made us in Massachusetts, train a group from Minnesota. The Manager that came along was an old school grump. Those employees told us how horrible production workers get treated in Minnesota. And it was true Our manager that took over in Burlington was a horrible man. Made us have a morning meeting and his tone towards us was disgusting. It went from a cool place to a sweat shop. In the end they triked us all and took Manufacturing away to Minnesota laid us all off in Burlington. Gave us super cheap Packages, and promissed us other payments that were never made. Gave us a cheap black and out the door...Thanks BSI."
bad,12 years in the Galway plant.Was a great place to work not anymore respect for no one hard  to get the holidays you want.They just use people now so they don't have to pay proper salary they are even trying to get the Product builders III to do supervisors job for very little extra pay.No matter how much extra work and hours you put in it's all the same outcome when they are finished with you it's back to trying to make things as hard as possible for you in the clean room.And whatever you do don't get sick.Plenty of other good employers in the Galway area now avoid if you want respect as an employee.They are constantly trying to cut costs for people at the bottom scale while management give themselves top bonuses.
bad,"Smart business company that benefits those above the production level. The work life balance for production is sadly not improving enough to improve this, making it a difficult environment for most employees to be happy about working O.T. most weekends."
bad,"I was told when hired that you only spend 2-3 weeks on a machine in order to learn it, get the certification, and then move on to another machine. This was because they wanted to be able to move people around so you're not doing the same thing every day. The 2-3 months I was there, I was on one machine the whole time. I had one day where they finally put me on another machine, but that was it, they sent me back to the other machine. The dexterity required for the machine I was on was a bit much for my large hands. I wasn't very fast, but I wasn't so slow that I was hindering the production for the day. I would've been happy to operate ANY of their other machines, even the one I tried. I was able to operate that other machine at top speed with no issues. At the end of my stint there, I got a call after my Friday shift not to show up Monday. I asked what the reasons were and they said that it was because I was refusing to work, complained all the time, and defied management. This was funny to me, because the whole time I was there, management never talked to me once. I didn't even get to defend myself on these accusations. The cherry on top of all this was the fact that the company had had a huge meeting about how management wasn't communicating with the employees enough. I don't know if this is the same throughout the whole company, but at least within the battery manufacturing section, management just doesn't care about anything but achieving the desired numbers and better. Apply at your own risk."
bad,"Great people to work with as a team, management needs to improve a lot. No paid lunch and sometimes overwhelming to work with slower workers who are older"
bad,"very regimented and multiply changes in management made it difficult to understand goals. Culture is good, but very cliquish. A deep understanding of medical protocol is helpful.  People are good and the most difficult thing is the time it takes to approve or process things due to government cite overview. Learned a lot and was a great opportunity and experience."
bad,"good entry level work place just to get your foot into the door, especially in the medical device industry. Growth is a question. Employees are treated with respect."
bad,"During the day I make stints and catheters in the assemble area."
bad,"I worked in a corporate role and was trying to get all divisions to follow the same set of quality system requirements.  This was an impossible task as the culture was too political between sites and there wasn't a management mandate to move in this direction.  The corporate role was eventually and predictably eliminated.  I would recommend employment here if it is clear that the role has a clear goal and is supported by management, otherwise be careful."
bad,TPM and Six Sigma structure was implemented strategically and effectively.
bad,"we make balloons that are used to make catheters,so we have eight hours to make more than 600 balloons"
bad,"Very conservative place ran by an old-boys network"
bad,"Learned a ton at BSC, but the role was not a good fit for my creative and hands-on desires. Work day was mostly solo work in my cube with little chance to meet other teams and interact with people face to face."
bad,temporary project. this was a temp assignment for a single project that ended as scheduled.  Nothing fancy about it no room for advancement.  people were very nice.
bad,"Boston Scientific went out of their way to make it clear that my position was temporary. When company-wide meetings were held, contractors were explicitly not invited. Every time I contacted a permanent employee to conduct work related to my position, that employee would either not respond at all or contact my supervisor and ask why I was making inquiries. The individuals who worked at the organization were reasonable, pleasant and professional. Unfortunately my supervisor was so busy attending meetings that she did not have the time to attend our ""weekly"" meetings several weeks running. Consequently I felt anxiety far in excess of what would have been reasonable given my work duties."
bad,Great Design assurance competency in Boston Scientific. Great collaboration amongst R&D and operations. launched very innovative medical devices. Industry leader in medical device development.
bad,Make medical wires. I really didn't learn anything. Management was good. I liked my co-workers. The hardest part was the long hours of doing the same thing over. 
bad,The same production theory if you are good at one thing or area they stick you in that area and keep you in that area till the end of time and and  wrong people in charge
bad,"It is good place to work, good benefits and room for growth after a couple of years of work. Time off is good as well. Overall good company to work for."
bad,"The Benefits from Boston Scientific are fantastic."
good,had a great time working here... but a lot of work to do and turnaround time was very narrow... required a lot of reprioritizing constantly.
good,central parknig was a good starting job but it was not enough to lead my life
good,BSC is good place to work overall.  the tax department was run by some people very young and energetic.  they are fast paced and trying to copy the culture from big 4s.
good,"Each day, work on complaint records, investigate allegations and submit MDR reports to the FDA in a timely manner."
good,"My division was completely disorganized. I was the only rep to hit their quarterly quota out of 4 on the east coast, due to lack of support and organization."
good,"Was a packager working 3rd shift as a temp. Didn't stay long enough to really see what it's like but overall, it was pretty fun just didn't like the hours of working 3rd shift."
good,At first I really enjoyed going into work but then the longer I was there the most difficult my co-workers became.  I was part time and my hours changed at least four times to work around the spoiled  brat I covered for. My supervisor worked and spoiled a certain two people and others she couldn't care less about. 
good,"You are asked to do more than is possible in any given day.  Projects are behind, so they make great decisions to lay people off instead of hiring more people to ease the burden.  The management lacks leadership, is lazy, has poor communication and does not support their employees.  They lack any means in which to actually drive the business.  They talk the talk about being innovative and a technology leader, but do not walk the walk to become these things.  "
good,"I’ve worked at Boston twice. Once was last year(2018)  From end of May until only the end of June, but I really enjoyed working there for the most part.  I ended up being pregnant and got really sick almost every single day so they kept telling me to go home, which ultimately got me put on medical leave. The lady who put me on medical had told me that i should’ve sucked it up, because she has been pregnant before and worked. To which I explained how with my first pregnancy I never got sick a single time, and with that pregnancy I was currently in, I was sick almost 24/7 for the first 4 months. She had also told me that I could’ve refused to go home each time my SUPERVISOR told me to leave, and I didn’t know I had much of a say-so in that decision.  "
good,"The Management is terrible and only after profit at the expense of the workers. No pathway for career advancement and you don't have job security."
good,"Many different factors during made the job challenging. Several departments competing with one another did not help the progress of the company. Also, not challenging enough."
good,Cannot write a very thorough review due to the fact that I was not employed very long.  Was hired through the onsite temporary agency worked 2nd shift and hated the drive out to Spencer.
good,didn't enjoy how my supervisor spoke to me one bit. he spoke to every temp in the same manner. did not enjoy coming to work at all
good,Low opportunity for growth.  BSC could have informed their new employees that there t is a low opporutnity for growth within the company and their career ladder is still being analyzed and reworked as many flaws have been reported.  A new career ladder will be available in q4 of 2014.
good,Management was more like a joke and no guidance. They are hardly around and they just try to make themselves look better at all times no matter how it affects their department.
good,"So if you work for assembly, the work is very simple and repetitive so it gets boring really fast, the one nice thing is that they allow you to keep your phone so that you can listen to music or podcasts. If you need a simple job that has specific shifts, are okay with repetition, and doesn't pay a lot unless you do OT--then this is the job for you!"
good,Employees are pushed  to management. No-one is commended for being great at their job and is pushed to move on. You can't be happy where you are otherwise that is not considered progress even if you are developing new skills and taking classes to better your group. To much management and not enough personnel to understand he business! Truth!
good,Company was thriving but they released full time employees and replaced them with contractors. No loyalty to the employees. Great that they are doing well but employee moral was awful.
good,"I worked so hard at boston scientific for about a year and a month but I did not received any things :medical ,vision ,401k benefic at all.beside that we had short break and lunch times."
good,Felt so stressful and treated badly as a contractor. less benefits as a contractor. Not much good enough to work as a team . Feels like biased for same race.
good,had to be super clean. they have really good working hours. the cafeteria is super nice. the work wasn't too demanding. nice people to work with. you get a free y membership.
good,"Well it depends on what department you are working in, but I can say for sure that in my department there is a lot of favoritism and your hard work does not get acknowledged for unless you have spent your time trying to play as teacher's pet. I am very disappointed that the people who have worked hard and have made the place a fun, friendly, interesting, and positive work place do not get the recognition that they deserve."
good,while working at Boston I find out that the manger and  supervisor was prejudice not on my opinion but base on reason or actual experience.  when a company has 95 % of Hispanic working in the company and everyone speak Spanish this in  American
good,it was a complete mess. Management had no clue what was going on and was more concerned about politics and not the job and getting it done. Many engineers left after i did.
good,"Some days you work, some days you work less- but overall you're on the hook 24hrs a day for anything possibility issue with a patient considered to have heart issues.  Working in a small team of electrophysiology and device specialists across the state makes for a lot of driving (compensated through a 3rd party mileage reimbursement company).  You're in as many cath labs and clinics as your territory provides on a daily basis.  Compensation between clinical reps and sales reps is a point of contention for the amount of work one does versus the other.  Personal life takes a back seat to the needs of an exponentially growing patient population."
good,"Young and energetic employees wanting to learn everything.  New technologies comes from acquisitions.  Not a lot of organic innovations and development.  Many technologies are competing with each other for a finite budget.  Clinical studies take most of the budget.  As your salary increases, your risk of getting cut also increases."
good,every time i worked here it was always temp service job. i didnt like not knowing when i would be having a job very un dependable. i did like it most of the time but there was alot of gossip all the time. between that and layoffs it was very up and down on feeling for this place.
good,"I left BSC because of the culture and how awful the employee moral was. "
good,"Use To be a good place to work, now they hire anybody. Manage cares nothing about Quality only Qaunity. Forced to work over everyday and every Saturday."
good,Typical large corporation.  Good work life balance. Little organic innovation. Mostly acquisition based. Not very good internal advancement opportunities.
good,"Eight hour shift was 10 to 12 work day with constant interpersonal battles with employees and staff."
good,it's a good place for a startup job. it pays the bills there's rarely any form of discrimination. You get to work with people from different ethnic backgrounds.
good,Nothing this job is a not for me. Just not enough pay for what you do. So it just is for a biginer .. I can not say I would ever move up in that company
good,It is a high stress place to work. no advancement unless you have a four year degree. I loved working there before Boston bought out Guidant. the culture changed and the work became stressful.
good,"High demand of OT very poor work/life balance. Under staffed. Very very poor yearly salary increase. Very poor training on equipment, there policy is learn by default.."
good,A company is struggling with getting profit and cutting cost is a primary goal for management still.
good,Fortune 500 company - facing challenges typical of medical device suppliers.
good,its a very fun place to work. i learned alot about the business
good,"no comment, would have rather had things in writig about career advancement witin this company, no other review information."
good,"Generally good first job - my dept moved around a lot as far as reporting to, so had new boss quirks to address routinely. Last group, maint., was a joke."
good,I worked for CRM for almost 20 years and once BSC took over they pushed employees to management and didn't see value in anything else other than upward movement and shareholder value! Anyone who disagreed was let go and didn't have a say in the way the business was ran. Pretty pathetic for a global company!
good,Great individuals very productive environment management wise very terrible could have done more on the behalf of his employees.. No advancement in career
good,"Won't advised. Diversity is only done at the production level. At that time I worked there, there was no African American as supervisor or line leader."
good,Using Filemaker to run logistical reports on reportable event for Customer Service. Would assist customer service technical reps that worked with the hospital and patients on the table to fix the medical device equipment.
good,"BSC has changed environment in a negative way, it is no longer a positive forward environment. This has caused many individuals to leave, which has also changed management and the workload of individuals. Co-workers are having negative, stressful attitudes"
good,covered a wide territory assisting doctors in the implantation of medical devices.
good,"Okay place to work, low pay, okay benefits, bad supervision."
good,"Learned alot about medical packaging; FDA documentation, clean room environment.  Co-workers were awesome & supportive as was my supervisor."
good,I greatly enjoyed and valued my experience with Boston Scientific.
good,Company on the cutting edge of technology but do not have a competitive compensation schedule.  Middle management(Territory Managers mostly) are either fantastic or terrible. Training is first class but struggle to retain employees on front line. Learned so much about sales and met amazing coworkers. Lots of long days and long drives.
good,Over all okay... however there are things which still the company can do better and take honest feedback from employees and try to get them implemented
good,I have worked here for about a year. The management is often changing and they pick favorites. If you’re a favorite then you are good to go. The hours are strenuous and more often than not you are asked a lot of yourself during those hours. They have very high standards and if you cannot meet them you will be fired. The pay is not terrible but also not great for what you are giving up. I was working 5-6 days a week and switched to 3 12 hour shifts and the balance honestly isn’t any better. If you don’t have a life I recommend this job.
good,This is a new shop that tries hard but falls short. Great with data and quality engineers but have no clue on how to build teams and moral within a group. Potential is off the charts. The business model is flat out wrong.
good,"I enjoyed the company very much, the are well stablished and the majority of the people are very nice."
good,I honestly don't remember to much about boston scientific. I know it was a temp to hire position so not a lot of opportunities to get in. They had good food and weight room on site
good,During shifts you have a quota you have to meet. Lines usually don't have enough workers on each machine to achieve this. Your lines will usually end with not reaching the quota.
good,Slow paced but a good place to start your career at entry level person looking to find a place to start and possibly build their warehouse career. Or even just to make a few bucks.
good,"Clean and stable environment. The upper management could use some time on the assembly floor and do the job to better understand employees though. The company offers good vacation time and great benefits for employees. Bullying not always addressed. Before becoming a direct Boston employee, you have to go through a temp agency. Meaning no sick leave and the company takes their sweet time converting you. Mine was 10 months, I know people who it took up to 2 years."
good,"I worked there as a temp Manufacturing Engineer and this was my first job.  I was tossed into the work with very little support.  In addition, one of my associate tried to prevent me from doing what need to be done for he wasn't clear of the process and the policies himself.  However, he was good with convincing the management.  All sr. engineers that support the areas I worked at were in different building.  Some of them were moved on to other company.  The upper management expected a fast result."
good,"Start running Multiple Machines with metal. Type in a program and it will start the cut. While  the machine is running, clean and restock the tables or machines."
good,"Progressive company with a strategic plan to diversify its portfolio.However, lacking International business strategy and diversity in their workforce. Great coworkers, very supportive and overall, a good environment. Management not very supporting of individual development & career progression."
good,"The company produces various types of catheters.  Even though the catheters may look simple, they are complex medical devices.  It is a manufacturing environment and requires focus to produce good quality product.  It is challenging to balance work and your personal life."
good,"Very exciting and Dynamic place to work with lots of perks."
good,"A Boston é uma excelente empresa, com salários e benefícios muito bons."
good,Boston you worked in a clean area. you had to gown up and wash your hands before entering the floor. You had to do everything by the general work instructions and there could be no deviation I learned how to log on and sign into my stations.  I learned how to change molds on different machines. co workers worked as a team and helped one another when needed . The stress was  the worse part of the job and everyone laughing and trying to get along was the best part of the job.
good,"High level of patient interaction and maintenance. This is the most rewarding part of the job.  I am able to see the life changing benefits of what I sell.  I create strong relationships with my physicians and their staff.  I am in the OR for all procedures from trial to permanent implant.  I have learned to negotiate pricing contracts with hospitals and surgery centers.  I am very self sufficient due to a lack of management availability.  If I need to know how to do anything, I am proactive in finding who can help me get it done.  Overall, I enjoy what I do and find it very rewarding at the end of the day."
good,"They prefer non-US employees, which means they are constantly down-sizing. This leads to a lot of nastiness and politics."
good,Inability to make decisions and not empowered.
good,Pre-weighing stents.
good,"The work was fine if you were single with no responsibilities for others at home.  Mandatory overtime often resulted in long workdays, including weekends.  That increased the paycheck, but it also increased fatigue & job burnout."
good,"Good Teams"
good,"Company focused on the associates and development. The jobs were technical and took skill to preform. Associates were treated fairly, but management was driven to excess."
good,"As an R & D  Technician, my role was to performed Repeatability & Re-productivity tests on Symphion System, it was quite hard to start as this task was given by management. Initially, I felt overwhelming. However, I have completed this task with confidence and provided test data and other relevant information to engineering and development team. Workplace culture was friendly and work as team member and individually. Hardest part of this job to find SOP , material and which equipments to used etc. I had also learned to performed tensile stress, strain, elasticity and column strength of guide wire and helped to CAPA"
good,"Management was fair, long hours at times for some individuals. Moral was low due to jobs being relocated.  Many individuals had been with the company 20-30 years so new ideas or procedures were not accepted to well."
good,"The priority is the patient, be dedicated to improving the quality of the product for the patient.Collaboration is the key to the success and everyone is involved."
good,"The management team and colleagues on my team were generally good people. The culture cultivated an environment where risk taking was encouraged. However, the risks being encouraged were often times borderline ethical."
good,"I learned at the end of the day, BSC had taught me good project management skills.  Handling a company-wide project to decommission the Extrusion Department in 3 months, was a good achievement."
good,Good people to work with and nice environment.  However I heard of impending layoffs and decided to go before everything went down. Otherwise I did like the hours.
good,Good to work. Stressful sometimes. Poor Upper Management. Very money minded and seeks only to save money. They dont care abt the employees in the lower strata.
good,Una gran Empresa sin gestión . La compra de empresas de gran tamaño la hizo una empresa muy difícil de gobernar
good,Hardest part of the job  is the times we had to work. Didmt know if you had to work on Saturdays until Thursdays. The air is really dry so if your a smoker then its hard to breath and I was pregnant and sick and want able to sit
good,"Time management is very essential. in order to operate the machines, we need the full team. thus, everyone need to show up and on time. two paid breaks are given to employees."
good,"Muchas cosas buenas e importantes claves de comunicación, los colegas algunos bastantes involucrados otros al contrario no , lo más difícil es a la hora de elaborar el producto es un proceso muy delicado ya que es algo que va a estar dentro de una persona, específicamente en arterias del corazón "
good,"It is fun working  a lot of things to learn and consider learning."
good,"A lot of products are being manufactured so this place is very productive. Work is quite easy, a lot of training are taking place. A lot of job rotation"
good,My experience at Boston Scientific was stressful every day. I worked with two Administrators that did not get along and I was put in the middle to get work done. This caused a lot of stress and it seemed Management and HR did nothing to help the situation.
good,The coworkers in the contact center are great. The job is receptive and relatively easy. The management is poor and disorganized
good,"It's a great company to work and learn, but the management is really poor. It doesn't have a good system to complain or improve when employees have a bad manager."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work for to ensure their health and safety is always protected.  They are always grateful to have someone on their side and make going to work each say worth every minute!
good,Too impersonal in what should have been a close to one another environment. Engineers just gave us a file and had no opinion or interest in seeing how we got the product to run.
good,"Tot 19 mei 2015 ben ik werkzaam geweest bij Boston Scientific Kerkrade (internationaal distributie centrum) als Inventory Control Operator."
good,Typical large company culture. Plenty of opportunity with a regular chance of lay-off. Upper management was still finding their direction for the company/themselves.
good,Extremely busy and environment very uptight.  Use to be better in the past.  No work life balance.
good,"BSC was a very interesting company to work at.  It was nice knowing every day we were making a positive impact on someone's life.  The group I worked in was an Internal Audit type group which allowed me to work cross functionally with all aspects of the Company.  I enjoyed being a part of the Audits and assisting groups with their improvement plans.  This group also reported to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors, having the responsibility to reporting to these groups with regard to positive changes other organizations were making on a quarterly basis was extremely rewarding."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that we make a difference in the lives of people.
good,"No emphasis on career development of the individual. Co-workers are pretty good and intelligent, know what they are doing."
good,"I was lucky to report to a very good Director and support a great team. Unfortunately, good management ended there. BSC is losing a lot of GREAT talent due to RIF's."
good,"What is a typical day at work? Busy with time managment so important, organized very scheluded to meet our projects I loved the work and was happy there."
good,Competitive medical device company who is looking to work lean but has a renewed focus on R & D.
good,Benefit package is ok. Pay seems to be acceptable. Management needs to get their act together and learn how to operate the business more efficient manner.
good,Boston was a okay place to worked. Did not give appropriate benefit as to other job but allow a lot of overtime to compensate. their employee had a positive attitude and made it a nice place to work.
good,This was a temporary position working through a contraction agency. Learned how medical manufacturing process were used and followed and the guidelines and how they differ from machine manufacture.
good,Overall a good company..  Well managed at executive level.  Long hours.  No work life balance.  Gym on site.  Good amenities. Team culture.  Positioned for growth..
good,hard to advance career with political climate
good,Temporary employees are said to have opportunity to become full time but instead are laid off to draw unemployment until rehire starting at square 1 no matter performance or attendance.
good,"Being a new organisation, the culture and entire set up is not good."
good,Work closely with pain doctors and neurosurgeons around the Spinal cord stimulator device. Referral work done for the doctors to increase patient pipeline. Work with patients to answer questions and concerns. Guide patient outcomes and drive business through customer service and OR expertise.
good,I enjoyed my time at Scimed. It introduced me to a different aspect of assembly. It had a meaning. My job was helping with a product that was going to save lives.
good,"Culture change when Boston bought Guidant.  Instead of working as a team, they pitted everyone against each other.  People left, work was just added on to the people left.  Management was only concerned on how they looked, not on the people below them. When as CPI, Guidant, it was a good place, everyone treated each other like family.  We worked together as family toward common goald Now departments only looking out for their own goals not what would be the best for the company as a whole."
good,"Bad management."
good,"Managers are not so good in IT department.Company main focus is R&D and sales."
good,"Boston Scientific as a whole is a great company & has many strong core values. Unfortunately those values will not be found in each & every department. Some of the most intelligent/hard working people I've ever met have worked within this company yet simultaneously, some of the least effective/proactive management I have worked with seems to thrive here. Be on the lookout for numerous open positions under the same hiring manager as this is a telltale sign of an unhappy, unmotivated team usually attributed to poor management style."
good,"Culture at Arden Hills was amazing but there is little room for advancement. Company policies are too strict. You cannot be late, besides this workplace environment has a high turnover rate for employees. "
good,"I get to work 10 minutes early, To make sure everything is ready for the shift. Orgarnising  my team and assigning  the  responsibilities as required."
good,Everyone is friendly. Great team work environment. Plenty of room to cross train. Management isn't good here especially night shifts. Things can go wrong and no communication whatsoever. Everyone gets along here and do their job. Work is light and easy but gets repetitive. Having a good team of co workers makes the job a little bit more enjoyable.
good,"Empresa dinamica, com aprendizado diário, benefícios bons, clima bom."
good,i loved the diversity of this job. the management was very selective when it comes to employees. i loved the hours. it was so much fun with my co workers.
good,we build different kind of medical devices to save people lives and limb which makes me very proud to be part of this organization.
good,"We have two parts of the line I'm on: inners and outers. On inners there are 3 people for 6 stations and it's very hard to keep ahead of the rest of the line, which the rest of the line can't run if we aren't ahead of them. I talked to the supervisor about it and he refused to give us another person (even for a short time) and he didn't seem to care."
good,"It was an interesting place to work, and majority of the place was pleasant. Co-workers were great, and the schedule was pretty good, even if you were working 12 hour shifts. Management leaves much to be desired as they tend to make the job much more harder than it needs to be, and cause huge amounts of stress."
good,Was a fun company to work for. I got to meet some great people. Company had to do large layoffs during rescission and I moved to another state.
good,Cliques that are clearly evident and extremely hard to penetrate. Middle managers that are either incompetent or are unable to move upward due to stalled promotions..
good,I joined as an intern and later on I was hired. I was lucky to meet a lot of helpful and knowledgable people. The management is different in each department. Most likely is good. It is the best place to grow and learn fast.
good,Awful hours! No one is able to even get sick because you have no replacement to cover your shift! Its 12 hours from 7pm to 7am so you have no work/life balance.
good,"Definitely, a great place to learn and gain unbelievable amount of clinical experiences. The job itself is very fullfilling and gratifying in terms of understanding the patient life cycle. In another word, once the patient has your device implanted in them, they are your responsibility for life of the patients' life."
good,"like high school, a lot of Gossip and complaining. Management is very pour. Planning is horrible, constantly running out of components to build quality product, then having to work overtime because they cant keep you with material you need."
good,"Stressful job, with small pay. Coworkers can be great, but management seems to care more about getting numbers than overall moral of employees."
good,"Company is well diversified in culture, age and gender etc.. Quality of the culture really varies from department to department. BS acquired Guidant and that side of the company has a legacy for good upward mobility. The company has had 4 CEO's in recent years. The company has been offshoring large chunks of the company with the advent of the latest CEO. The overall morale of the company is low."
good,"When I first began work at Boston Scientific, it was much more fun and they were more deeply involved in Clinical trials with regards to heart stents.  During the course of my employment, focus on this type of device became less important, than the focus on stents for other types of illness or disease that required intervention, such as brain aneurism, and stents for the upper leg.  Management changed several times, and many of the activities which they did for employees just ceased.  They are currently still working through many changes, and I have left the company to pursue part-time work."
good,"A typical work day is good, but the past three years hasn't been typical, they're doing a lot of cut backs and you have to work lots of over time to keep up. Management not so good, they move supervisors around about every three to four months, and they come in change things and expect you to be doing it in a week. Co-works are like working anywhere else you have your nice ones that will help and you have those that won't help you, but stand around waiting for you to help them. The hardest part of the job was all the over time, cause they kept changing the hours and you had to go in earlier, I didn't like getting up at 2:00 am. The most enjoyable part was when I started their in 2004 they had plenty of help and it was fun to be their. "
good,Company has great product line that save lives. Management tend to be inconsistent with decision making. Majority of the co-workers are friendly. Some systems were not aligned.
good,"I enjoyed working at this place because I was able to train new employees, and I was also able to work with medical products that saved people's lives"
good,Good place to work. Lots of ot available. Management seems to be all over the place. Raises are small. Lots of opportunity for different positions. Over all a decent place to work.
good,The people that ive worked with thats been there the longest feels very comfortable and think they can do whatever they want they are loud and obnoxious and are not very nice to you. They make you feel uncomfortable. They stick to who they know and are very jealous. The company do not let you know much you would have to find your way around.
good,"Busy work day, fast pace under payed. Push to get daily numbers. Weekend overtime. Constant change to get higher production numbers. Performance review needs to change for hourly manufacturing  workers."
good,So much overtime and little pay. Very competitive place and favoritisms. Coworkers often lacked experience and fooled around and got paid more than others who actually worked.
good,"o	Observing Special Guidelines and Operating Instructions (SGOI)	"
good,The workplace culture was just okay. There were cliques but nothing to worry about because everyone worked well together and it really helped making work here a lot more enjoyable.
good,very fast pace company with a lot of order world wide. very clean and management very professional. working on clean rooms to build medical devices for handicap people
good,"Boston Scientific is a good opportunity to work for the entry level. They pay average rate. The location is very good(a huge parking lot, a safety place)"
good,"Manufacturing Technician IV"
good,I was not a full time employee. Management I worked with was good. The engineers were hard working and knowledgeable. New product development group was a good group.
good,I loved the pace and how you had to be accountable for yourself. A day would consist of me clocking in and getting to work. medical assembly paid fine but the scheduled didn't work for me.
good,"goede werkgever voor een startende werker."
good,"I learned many things particularly about medical implants, including policies and procedures which is very important in that field.  Depending on which department you are in your position will require you to be able to handle a very fast paced work environment."
good,It's a cool place to work at and the people you meet are what makes the job worth it. Many things to learn and improve on and many opportunities to move up.
good,"I worked for this company for 6 years, definitely take care of their employees pay isn't the best but they have good benefits and lots of discounts for employees."
good,"Great work life balance, great pay, cool technology, willing to reinvest in their employees. Nice facilities. Stagnant environment in so many regards to simple fixes not being able to implement"
good,"Good place to work but the kind of work you get depends on the manager you have."
good,overall great company to work with. made medical devices. aka catheters that go out to doctors and hospitals to use for patients Training was really good and employees were friendly.
good,Grinding small medical parts and devices. I learned team work and using analytical thinking and skills to work with usually things. The environment was usually clean and safety and quality were major priority for the company
good,Good work environment and fair pay and benefits. Some trouble with management at the end of employment. I learned many leadership skills as well as team work and time management.
good,It has its perks with benefits. It does some nice activities for employees. Several activities to attend that foster teamwork. We have a patient day to listen to how whoat we do impacts their lives.
good,"I enjoyed my time there when things were going well, but it became obvious the place had too many senior engineers when I say idle with no projects in my pipeline and management could not identify work for me to do for about 3-5 months before my departure."
good,"Good enviorment. Bad management and lack of pay also favors workers.This company really lacks of communication and Team work. "
good,I learnt a lot of new things. i  have decided to grow in my position so I was thinking to change company .colleagues  were good and manager was nice .I like the company
good,"Eight hour days, five days a week.  Decent culture.  I was treated well and with respect.  Training was important to the company.  Learning company specific information was the most difficult."
good,This is a very paperwork intensive atmosphere.  There is a lot of red tape and it is slow going when improvements are to be made.  The feeling of accomplishment is great due to the products you are manufacturing.
good,Treated contractors well offered free breakfast and lunches regularly. Management seemed reasonable and genuinely cared for its people. Would recommend people to work here .
good,working environment looks fine but too much stressful and lack of team work. managements are not considerate due to working as a temporary agent and being an assembler
good,"Very stressful to some point , always have to be on the move and ready for next task . quick paced for sure . Also didnt give us full lunch break only 24 minutes."
good,"I eventually was hired on at this company and once I was I was able to give a glowing review, but as a contractor, there were many things that I wasn't able to enjoy. The benefits and pay was severely limited in comparison. I didn't quite feel like I belonged as part of the company though I was doing quite a bit of work there."
good,I learned to work with medical products. I was taught to treat the job as if your life depended on it. The job showed me what we do with the medical device in the real world.
good,BSC is a relatively good place to work.  The people are fun and the company makes life saving products.  Some issues with work/life balance.  CEO seems very good.
good,"assemble medical devices on an assembly line, they pushed hard to get a lot of products out in a shift.  the hardest part was in keeping up with the demand of the line."
good,Strong internal competition among the managers and other professionals. There is a good level of ethics and the management motivates the other professional in general to up date their careers by making courses
good,"my job was easy going welcome people in take phone calls and fill out papers. very nice empoyers, see happy faces everything. and there's alway something to look forward to."
good,"Managing and processing data and products through using a manufacturing execution systems in order to effectively produce stent catheters safely, efficiently and effectively."
good,Very impressive for initial impression.  Very big and well managed.  Very structural. Great training and learning. People were wonderful to work with.
good,"Alles gericht op sales, maar achterliggende organisatie (nog) niet goed voor elkaar."
good,My day at work consisted of cleaning stents with assed. Management was ok most the help came from the line leader. The co-workers were fun to be around. The hardest part of my job was to remember witch stent was clean and witch was dirty.
good,It was a good experience working at boston scientific where i learned how to coordinate with the team and managing the time etc.
good,opened and closed prepared all meals and menu for the week. Answered all questions from customers cleaned all work stations.prepared itemized bill and accepted all customers payment.
good,"A typical day at work; you come in, go to your station that you usually work at (unless told to work at a different station) and perform your tasks. I started off on 2nd shift; the people are great, everyone is part of the family on your shift. Management was alright, I felt like it was a bit disorganized at times. The hardest part of the job would be to hit our goal numbers. On a normal day when things are going well, it's doable. On days where things are going bad (machines are down, parts are coming out bad for unknown reasons, etc) it's really hard to hit our goals but we are still expected to reach it. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people; they make work life better."
good,"Boston Scientific is a substantial company competing in the Medical Device market which is regulated by the FDA and DEKRA. As such there is an extensive quality system that includes Engineering, Quality, Regulatory, Clinical, and Medical involvement in all aspects of the work environment."
good,"I was inly there for a temp position.  Speaking to the other employees, there is no real room for advancement but the work environment makes it easier to overlook that.  It is easy to get your work done without much supervision or supervisor breathing down your throat."
good,"good place to work, I enjoy my job and like what I do.  There is a real problem with change here. I work with really nice people."
good,"I learned so many things from company such as "
good,the changes they are always having us do to see what will get out the best production in a timely matter. it is a good place to work but there are times that we might get the right motivation to adjust to the changes that they want us to do
good,"I enjoyed my contract job at Boston Scientific. Boston is a fast paced work environment, while tedious as many manufacturing jobs are. Each and every day procured a new situation or new challenges. At Boston I was a leader among my peers. When we had specialized orders I took the time to walk around are line to make certain the steps were being followed appropriately. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving every day knowing my job makes a difference in saving lives."
good,"Great team, crazy hours but worthwhile work- very personally rewarding.  Wonderful colleagues with a lot to teach-- every day varies greatly with new projects, technology and patient interactions."
good,Interessante stageplaats voor verschillende vakgebieden
good,Worked on a production line producing catheters. I learned a good deal about the health issues that boston scientific deal with. My management pushed us hard to reach targets but I had no issue with  my management team. I felt I had a good relationship with them. My co-workers were hard working and made it an easy going place to work. The hardest part of the job was being on the same step day in day out without being cross trained on another step. * hours every day on the same step was demoralising. The bonuses was a huge incentive.
good,"it was a ok day, I got to learn how to put some of the springs together, it was a little tough how to use the microscope but was starting to get it ,but did not get to continue there cause they discontinued my assignment there"
good,"Its not a bad place to work, just depends what line you are on and the café is super cheap. Depending on what line you are on you may have a lot of overtime. Although some lines do only work mon- friday"

good,Working at Boston is okay. People that work there do not have the opportunity to move up to higher position. Okay to work there. Okay to work there.
good,The hot lunches available will always be fascinating to me. But the best part of working at an awesome place is being able to listen to your own awesome music.
good,"Boston Scientific runs on a lean staff, opportunity is there for the hard working folk."
good,"This was my first time working in an engineering research environment. Professor Yegian and Seda Gokyer provide individuals with time to work on problems by themselves but are always there for support and advice. They are extremely dedicated to their goals, but also make time to show kids the lab through the summer and make time to have casual lunches with other researchers."
good,"Plan, direct, and execute existing and new business development activities including marketing, conducting sales calls, quoting, following up, and closing the sale. "
good,Made artificial devices for the human body. Company was ok. Company took care of employees.
good,The employees at Boston Scientific were very helpful and gave guidance throughout my placement there. They were very good at giving tips about keeping up with production. I learned that it's important to work as part of a team and that communication is also very important between management and the team. My co-workers were good fun and friendly. The hardest part of the job was the speed of production and keeping up with this was very difficult at times as well as maintaining quality.
good,"Great company!"
good,Learned how to make therapeutic catheters for patients. Great environment to work. People were always friendly and helpful. Hardest part of job was being on my feet for hours.
good,"I originally started in the customer service department, handling incoming calls from sales reps regarding patients then was promoted to the billing department where I was given certain states that I must bill for DME given to the patients.  I would obtain authorization for the DME and I would make sure there were current CMN's on file.  Filed billing electronically."

Although i share a good rapport with most of the customers Boston's goodwill and pdts gave a push to strengthen my rapport and relationship with the customers. Managing TM's, forecasting, planning and execution form my typical day at work."
good,BSC is fairly unorganized and has a strange corporate structure but the product is the best in class.
good,Dynamic work environment. The company culture kept you in a position for an average of 5 yrs and can be difficult to move around and get promotions.
good,"My position was eliminated after acquisition of our company.  Attempted to obtain another job internally without success.  I don't have a positive or negative opinion. I was not impressed with their integration process."
good,"Lots of hours, lots of demand but still good quality. You live at work. At least you can have fun with coworkers if you can stay awake."
good,"They really push you to keep push out numbers even if it is light work. They push people to the breaking point. I don't understand why since they should open up more lines the pace is a bit ridiculous. Makes employees prone to bad reviews if they ""can't keep up."" Very hard to hold a job there if you aren't able to do all of the above and more. Only thing I enjoyed was the informational company events."
good,"Working at Boston Scientific is a rewarding, experience. The mindset of management has always been to continuously improve all aspects of patient care and business continuity throughout the organization. Boston Scientific endeavors to make the workplace culture, one of mutual respect, collaborative improvement, and cultural diversity and inclusivity."

good,The company hired 80% of people who worked there was asian.Most of them couldn't complete 1sentance of english and the bosses give them 10-15 cent raise and they are happy.While 1 do 4 different jobs in the warehouse and get the same pay.That wasn't fair at all to me.Got laid off with 1500 other people the same day world wide.
good,It is a good place to work with and you will enjoy working with the people there.  Work is reasonable.  People enjoy working with each other and there is no stress and no pressure.  Life is good.
good,This place was a nice and friendly place to work. Everyone was very helpful and nice. The pc and the boss was very understanding.
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in and setting up the machines in our department ready for testing and production. What I learned while working there was how to run 5-7 machine(lasers) that cut out parts called stents. Management was at its highest with the effort and cooperation of everyone around for the best and possible healthy environment. My co-workers were hard working and very helpful if I were to have any questions. The hardest part of the job was if you couldn't multitask and remember what you previously have done before you were working on another machine, then you would have had a hard time without the proper training. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and learning new things job related."
good,"Empresa com estrutura bem enxuta, porém o ambiente é supre agradável, muitos terceiros..."
good,At one point BSC was a great company to work for. But after management change everything change. I use to like to work for them but at the end it was not a great place. No chance to move up if your a minority. Wrong people on the wrong job ( HR ).
good,"however, company had to relocate overseas, otherwise this would have been the ideal workplace."
good,"shift work which is very hard, not ambitious work, boring, working under pressure because of targets, menagement treats operators in different way then people working in the offices"
good,"I'm kind a person will ready to work, do, and learn everything. I learned a lot from my works history and willing to learn more in the future. My co-worker are very nice, helping each other to the succeed. There's no hardest part because if I followed the instruction right, step by step so everything is simple."
good,"this job was the most easiest job i have ever worked at however it was very fun! lunch was great and to conduct a product knowing it's going in someones body can seem pretty scary!! along with the rules and guidelines! no makeup we had to wear scrubs,shoe covers and a mask to ensure the product had no germs. The hard part was conducting 2000 a day. sometimes goals were reached sometimes they weren't. Sadly the company moved and I was layed off"
good,"Most places will give employees incentives or awards, Boston Scientific does not do this."
good,The hardest part of the job was being coached in a short time frame. The group needed more time in certain areas when having to learn a new work process. There should have been in-class training before rolling out the process where every team could be on the same page rather than just viewing a presentation.
good,What inspires me to work for Boston Scientific is the impact I have on transforming people's lives. I appreciate the work life balance culture and being part of a team that truly changes people's lives for the better.

good,"22 years and saw many changes some good some not so good. I had a new boss every 4 years and needed to adjust to what they expected from their administrative assistant. I loved the Company in so many ways and never thought I would leave. I was a ""reduction in force"" (RIF) employee and did not know how to take this situation in my life."
good,The culture is challenging given the amount of changes that occur so frequently. Hard to keep traction going in any direction.

good,"Working fast and hard to achieve our goal withing every hour and making sure we correctly accomplish our job correctly  as a team. assembling certain medial wiring and processing the produce through specific operation such as wire length, attachment. and ect."
good,The work is pretty simple. Days goes pretty hard if team is filled with bunch of new people under 1 year. Certified Back-up Trainers should be paid as much as a Certified Trainer.
good,It's a a good for inexperience people who are just going in medical assembly. The pay is rather good for inexperience people also. They have good bonus for temps and at times they even have benefit if you attend the whole month without calling in. The co-workers are friendly. Lunch hr is good and they have a huge cafeteria for everyone; tons of microwaves and space for people. They provide free food on special holidays and free shirts.
good,"Overall a better than average employer. For upward mobility, need to change positions every 3 years. Loyalty and longevity are not rewarded. Great place for interns and someone starting a career. Great education benefit and advancement opportunities for those willing to relocate."
good,If you like a constantly changing environment and fast pace work place this is the place to be.

good,Good management team. Great life balance. Job is pretty low stress.
good,"BSC is a good company to work with, if BSC is hiring assembly i will reapply to work . They have good benefits and job security."
good,"BSC has "" Excellent "" employee benefits and strives to have its employees covered and secure."
good,"A typical day at work would start at 8.30 and finish at5.30"
good,"I do inspection of medical product all day, I have learnt how to work as a team because we all do common goal to save lives and our customer is the number one goal. The work place is clean, attractive, and the management is a question,but ok. The hardest part of the job is when some complaints comes from the Doctor about the product that you assemble or inspected because we all expect zero defects on quality and complains from the management and quality Engineers. The most enjoyable part of the job is you feel proud on what you do in saving someone's life and it's never end because it's the objectives and culture of the company to make sure you save as many lives of people around the globe."

good,"This company does not aim to provide employees with a good work life balance, or good pay. management is inconsiderate and rude"
good,Fun people to be around with. Sometimes environment might no be so good to be around. Good leaderships. Traveling and benefits are ok. Pay is not the best.
good,It a great company to work for if you don't mind work being your priority. They value diversity and publicly promote equality no matter who you are and what you believe in. It has become a very stressful environment since they announced the Valencia location was being relocated to other Boston Scientific facilities outside of the country. This decision was made so they could save on money. Boston Scientific is having us work continuously until it is time for us to ramp down production while it ramps up in other facilities.
good,Every year the team spent reaching poor people by providing them gifts and feeding program. Workplace culture is very tough. Hardest part is the overlapping deadlines.
good,Provides ability to learn a lot.  Management does not praise you for doing a good job.  
good,"I worked here for about 8 years, they closed down and relocated to Costa Rica because it was cheaper labor. It was good while it lasted, don't ever get to comfortable."

good,Best part of Boston scientific was lots of young engineers. Most of them were nice and i never had any issue with co-workers.
good,you can make good money at Boston Scientific but most of that is do to the mandatory over time.  the odd hours and constant mandatory over time takes up all of your time and you do not have  a life outside of the company.
good,"Unpredictable work load, and timeline changes for creative design projects."
good,"Job paid well and the hours were well, but if there was too much Work In Progress, you were to work overtime any weekend they needed the help. Fast paced environment, but there are many different places to work in."
good,Same thing everyday. They pay good enough. No drama caused you're masked head to toe and don't have to talk to people. Do good and people want you on their team. Do too good and you become a threat.
good,"Overall, Boston Scientific is a good place to work. However, I found the work to be limited and not challenging creatively. They take good care of their employees. We are compensated well and have good work life balance."
good,"No one really wanted to be there and the office was depressing outside of the labs, but actually performing tests inside the lab was a great experience"
good,"The work its easy and the conditions of work amazing. Hours may be tricky cope at night shift but manageable during morning and evening shift."
good,"The company has an excellent vision, it follows its mission well. However, some of the management are ridiculously unfit for the position which drives bad culture in certain divisions."

good,The management is very fair.  Work hours are based on shifts.  First shift is the most convenient to work with children.  Fast paced environment.
good,"BSC was a great learning experience and is excellent for newcomers to the industry. There are lots of trainings and opportunities to learn new skills. Unfortunately, advancement and the culture is not so good. There is constant talk of layoffs and the moral suffers."
good,Better than other ware house jobs as it is clean room. The room is always comfortable and the pay is good. There is a little room for advancement and no free snacks.
good,Good place to work for just the low salary. You get trained and certified on a lot of different work areas. Fast pace work most of the time but overall good company.
good,"Mature infrastructure, excellent benefits, roles clearly defined. Infrastructure, benefits are driven by corporate. Ample resources to accomplish goals."

good,"I worked on 3rd shift. I started as a temp and got hired on as a machine operator quickly, the work is repetitive but you can make it fun, especially if you like your coworkers. They offer some good benefits and pay is above average. Lots of opportunities for overtime, sometimes required, sometimes not."
good,"Back in the time I was working at boston scientific, there only problem was to hire there employees. You can be a temporary employee for years. You will be laid of after a year."
good,They make you work long hours up to 12 hours a day and they want you to work weekends.  The work is easy but long.  The commute was difficult.  They pay time and a half for overtime.
good,"Most of the team I am on are new to the company. There are 27 of us and all but 5 are contractors working on a year project. This being said, everyone works well together to get the remediation validation project done."

good,"Working through the temp service was hard because benefits were low through them but the company did a lot otherwise. Good company to work for, they did strive to acknowledge you and gave gift cards, lunch ins, parties, token recognition, etc. Throughout the year. Be prepared for overtime in your area though! The temp service tried to be attentive and i never had big problems with them, they would check on you weekly which was nice! The communication between the two was hard."

Un día normal consistia en asistir a las salas de Hemodinamia y llevar los materiales necesarios para que los Medicos pudieran realizar sus estudios y poder intervenir a sus pacientes. Era fundamental estar involucrado y enfocado en las necesidades de los Médicos y enfermeras ya que eso significaba salvar una vida. Soy reiterativo en este aspecto porque algo que me marco es que desde la alta dirección estuvieran sensibilizados en que cada acción que llevaramos a cabo podría ser de ayuda para mejorar la vida de un paciente. El trabajo en equipo era fundamental ya que atendíamos diferentes hospitales con urgencias y necesidades que a veces se empalmaban. La parte más dificil eran las guardias y trabajar las 24 hrs. ya que a veces nos llamaban en la noche y había que acudir y a veces sacrificabamos tiempo de nuestras familias. ´Todo el tiempo estuve aprendiendo ya que salían nuevos productos que atendían diferentes enfermedades. Es un trabajo muy completo ya que pude planear, administrar y ejecutar acciones. El 90% estaba en los hospitales y un 10% en la oficina o haciendo trabajo desde casa."

Management doors are open for everyone and they expect people to come in with questions or concerns. Co-workers work as one team even though they represent all functions.

good,BSC is a company that you have to put in the hard work if you want to be more. The experience I have gained working will help me be better at all aspects of my life.
good,"High paying company with very competent management.  Experiencing a great deal of turmoil while transitioning from a product centric company to a brand management company.

good,Great company to work with and great benefits too.  The management was very concerned about the employees.  But the time  had come that company has to decide to close the San Diego facility.

good,"Hard  work fast  pace enjoyed working there for 30 years"
good,"A focused company with a lot of very dedicated individuals."
good,Is a Good Company to work for your extremely busy your day goes by really quickly. I Learned about pre-authrizations. Management needs a lot of improvement they try to micromanage the department ridiculous. Work Culture is great they understand when you need time off. Then Again you can be punished for taking days off. Once you take days off your work load because a nightmare. The hardest part of the job is not the job itself is management they suffocate you and overwork you. The requirements is to take 25 cases out and when you don't meet that requirement you get punish for it too. Job itself is a piece of cake but management is on you so bad that makes your job hard. if management wasn't as bad it would be much smoother. Is so bad that it almost feel like they set you up to fail. The most enjoyable about this job you go in early you come out early.
good,"- Best part of the job is working with the people around you and working as a team to finish tasks."
good,I spent much of my working career working for BSC. They offer great benefits to their employees and offer courses to help you grow. However the downfall for working for this company is that employees from different sites are sometimes looked past for new positions. Management also makes it hard for you to grow or even leave your position.

good,"A typical day at Boston Scientific starts off with a trip upstairs to our Customer Service area where a large TV displays new hires, events for the week and any campus updates. Tackling my day to day responsibilities was a priority for me. There was always something new to learn or the opportunity to help out other departments. When assisting other departments I found out fast that their responsibilities were no easier than mine. I learned not to take what other people for granted. My Director was great about making stops at all of our desks once a week as a check in. The most enjoyable part of the job was when our VP would email out patient stories and how our devices impacted the quality of their life. Every year we celebrated Customer Service Week, they had food catered in everyday, games and the last day was the main event. I truly felt part of the Boston Scientific family."
good,after being fully trained in  all aspects in the production of medical device I was then requested to test completed devices for  leaks . Problems arose in this section and I suggested ways to eliminate these problems which were implemented.

With the right attitude, the sky is the limit with this organization."
good,"Skills "
good,"Even though I worked long weeks at BSC, I enjoyed the time I spent employed there. Overtime was almost always available, time and a half for working overtime, and the possibility to make double-time on Sundays. So, if you don't mind working a lot, then you will make good money at Boston Scientific, even in an entry level position. I started out making almost $14 an hour with absolutely no experience in the medical manufacturing business. They train you in a way that is impossible to mess up, that anyone can be taught. The people that work there are all very understanding and anyone can help you if you need it. Also, BSC has a very LGBT inclusive policy. INCLUDING THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE! So, if you're Transgender and having issues getting proper health insurance coverage, Boston Scientific is a PHENOMENAL company to work for."

I gained skills that have furthered my career, not only in the Medical Device industry, but in general as well. I would not be where I'm at today without the great experience Boston Scientific gave me. The people and culture there are amazing!

Never worked more than 12 days in a row, however. Got offer to convert to full-time after nine months of working there. Workplace culture is GREAT! Honestly, this is a great company to work for and to make a career with. It takes awhile to move up into the company, however. You can always call and ask to be placed in another department or another shift when there are openings available. You get the entire week of July 4th and the week of Christmas/New Year's off, but some departments will work those weeks. Paid holiday pay even as a temp employee."

After that management was ok at best, not all that great.  I worked with the Controller that was demeaning to others and me once and at times nice and understanding. I worked with a gal that was threatened I might take her job, another thought I was competition.  I believe that was the hardest part of the job.  I have never worked somewhere, and not been treated like I did at Xlumena.  Once Boston came on board, life got easier.  Some of people that were not so nice were now gone.   "
