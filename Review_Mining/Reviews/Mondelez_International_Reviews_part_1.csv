rating,review
bad,A typical day at work is being understaffed and forced to work 12-16 hours per day because you cannot go home until the work is done. Employees show up drunk and/or high and were never sent home or disciplined. Very unsafe work conditions. Awarded with pizza occasionally after inspections were passed.
bad,"Very little room for advancement.  Part time employees are given less than 24 hour notice of their work schedule so it is hard to plan anything or make appointments.  You are never in the same stores from day to day so often times, no one does everything they are supposed to because they know someone else will have to deal with it the next day.  Nothing is consistent with this place.  They will tell you one thing and then do the opposite."
bad,"B. Fritz inkompetent für seine Position"
bad,Promised 30 hrs training got 10. Promised 15 - 20 hrs week got 6. Required 30 cases of product worked per hr but only given half the time to finish work  so for 120 cases I was given one hour to complete the task.
bad,Wack company to work for they not good to you i just wish i was a little better with communication with management  when things are wrong with equipment.
bad,"•	Managed product inventory for 20 retail locations ensuring proper rotation and freshness."
bad,Every year expect more work with less pay. Mangment constantly changing becuase of demand and lack of quality managers willing to accept the postion for the pay. Worst mangment ever experienced in retail. Over 20 years of retail experience.
bad,People who scheduled employee routes did a poor job. They would have us driving all over North Texas just to service 7 or 8 stores on any given day. Complete waste of time and gas.
bad,"They will work you to death. Drive time not counted when they do schedule. They give you 40 hours and then you drive 4 or more hours a day on top of work hours. If you get hurt on job, they fight the claim and send emails of lies to LnI to try to get out of paying your claim."
bad,"Cultura retrógrada, maus hábitos.. metodologia inoperante. Péssima Empresa."
bad,More work than pay and it's bi weekly can't have a life with this job its literally  check for check I would not recommend  this for someone trying to provide for a family
bad,"Too many stops not enough help and having to deal with placing a lot of stock in back room that the managers of the stores doesn't want in them."
bad,Started at 25-30hrs week quit after being scheduled only 1 day a week for about 1.5hrs a week total supervisor lies and unorganized drive 30-50 miles from your home salesmen not taking responsibilitie for there over ordering of product then you have to deal with receiving clerk for taking up to much space in the store
bad,Bad company to work for all around. Poor quality management. Little to no training. Lots of hype and no follow thru. Horrible time keeping system.  Wouldn't do it again.
bad,The hours are WAY too long at 12 hours a shift for only 14.50/hr. The supervisors are picky against some and too lenient with others.  It is a stressful and very tiring place to work. Not worth the 12 hours a day. They even made us pay for the candy if we wanted to take any home.
bad,"They PREACH work life balance. There is NONE. You get your schedule, at 5pm the day before and it will frequently change. They give the Sales and Senior Sales more deliveries than the merchandisers because if they keep the merchandisers hours low, upper management will bonus. Sales and Seniors are told they will only do about 30% of deliveries, but that is total lie. As a Senior, you travel constantly. A week, at a time, you are on the road, covering a Sales persons territory, while they are on PTO. Sales people will leave Seniors all their returns and out of dates to clean up, when they are on PTO and then throw you under the bus when they come back. Management turns a blind eye to the Sales peoples sloppy work and blames it on store and merchandisers. Stores treat you horribly. Management will call Sales on their approved PTO, if they have an issue. Must build displays and do deliveries on ad day. Truck deliveries come at different times, every day and are constantly late, so again work life balance is a joke. If a truck is a few hours late, you are expected to clock out and sit in the parking lot, of the store and wait till the truck gets there and then clock back in. The time in store, they assign you is never enough to get the job done properly. Management is clueless to the challenges, at store level until a truck delivery is denied, at a store. Then they care because the sales loss, from that delivery not coming through, affects their bonus. Work is very monotonous and hard. Your feet, your back and your knees will kill you because you're constantly on hard floors at"
bad,"the job was boring, bosses sucked and bunch of kiss butts there.."
bad,This was without a doubt the worst vocational decision of my life. I was with the company for years and was passed over for promotion several times.  Please do not waste your time and efforts with Mondelez International.
bad,I have worked with this company long enough and it shows that hard work doe not get you anywhere. seems like the ones who do the least amount of work get promoted and recognition for other people's work. I chose to leave this company because I am no longer proud to work for a company as messed up as this. we have managers that do not even qualify to be entry level employees.
bad,"Poor management, poor ventalation lots of excessive powder in production area of packaging. Low morale  favoritism. Will put someone in charge over crew that has little to no experience. Poor and little leadership.."
bad,"Great on the surface, and the worst nightmare underneath. The culture is borderline brainwashing, and the job performance was judged upon social interaction and not excellence of execution. Very hostile work environment."
bad,"They promote ""fun"", ""safety"" and ""collaboration"" , but it's none of those things.  The managers and scheduling are nightmares.  You are expected to be available at literally an hour's notice and when you are asked to pitch in and cover busy times, then they complain about hours worked and threaten to withhold pay.  They are constantly pushing the output quota, but it's impossible to meet it while staying safe and having the end result look ""grand opening"" ready"
bad,"Un-involved District manager, no room for advancement.  Not enough employees to cover territory.  Hard to fire employees who are not doing their job, others have to cover."
bad,"this was the most awful experience and a complete waste of almost three years, this company never promoted from within and the female manager maintained and endorsed and provoked a hostile working environment"
bad,"I worked him briefly the manager is TERRIBLE lacks self esteem so she talks negatively about the employees. She encourages temps to steal company time, I feel the corporation is a good place but because they have negative people they run the place no one will ever prosper unless you like to kiss up. Uncomfortable work environment the manager is very childish !!!"
bad,You use your personal vehicle to drive store to store. no specified lunch or break. very poor communication with management. poor instructions. very stressful
bad,Management promotes team atmosphere.  The team is consisting people that are out for themselves and don't care about others.  Which makes for a very difficult working work atmosphere.  This is why there is a high turnover in people.
bad,very hard work for the money you need to be at the grocery stores at 5:30 in the morning.  They did not pay you to drive your car to the first location and then they put the gas money on your paycheck.  Really horrible company to work for.
bad,"Hurry hurry hurry, nothing is done to completion. If you just want to get by. This job is perfect if you take pride in your work you need to move on. I haven't worked for a company this bad ever."
bad,Se coge nucho peso y no existe ergonomia en los puestos de trabajo
bad,"The company is falling apart. The multi-tiered nature creates animosity. There is a culture in the company of passing the buck, making store personnel out to be bad guys thus making for an uncomfortable relationship between Mondelez and whatever store you are working within. The management was incompetent to say the least."
bad,automated schedule creator limits hours but you are required to work an entire store under the limit with too much stock. working the full store can get you fired
bad,"trabajo de 8 horas, por agencia, la empresa no contrata"
bad,"would not recommend this job to anyone vague on pay wouldnt pay mileage never let you know when orders were in"
bad,"terrible pay, no paid days off no benefits.they will work you 70 hours 1 week 10 hours the next. tons of driving, the job isn't hard but the pay is terrible."
bad,"This company will call you in the middle of the night to work you in the next morning. You never know what your schedule will be the next day. Merchandising is very stressful. You will work parttime-fulltime anywhere between 6-8 hours a day. Maybe 30-45 hours a week if you really can move. "
bad,"When you first start the managers make sure you're happy and take care of you, after that you're just another person that they could care less about. "
bad,"Management does not take fresh ideas from employees even if it helps the company make money. Push for sales at all costs, not customer or employee friendly."
bad,Cuotas altas para k no le llegues.no le interesa el personal.rotacion de personal bruto.seguro gastos medicos hasta k no tienes planta pero misma exigencia como si la tuvieras....Solo el nombre le quedo....anteriormente nadie se salia de esta empresa.
bad,"it seems if you need to ask off then they don't work you.  they don't hire from within. no hope for advancement. they are not fair about the hours at all, they have their favorites and i'm not one of them .. since I have been with the company they have hired two new full time people they knew I wanted full time but no, not even consideration, hired from outside friends which I think is pretty darn sorry."
bad,"They can't keep anybody ,when they think they have enough part timers they give the hours to new part timers ! I would not recommend this company at all !"
bad,"Poor management. All were under 25 and had no idea how to deal with people. Took 5 weeks to recieve 1st check. 2 months later they still owe me for my mileage. Rude,unprofessional, and if you don't suck up you get 0 hours. They will also run you in different territories with no notice. Have to wait daily for a schedule. Took 4 weeks just to get hired in. Don't waste your time here. Company has gone totally downhill"
bad,"Management is awful, customer service takes forever to help you, if they even do. This us the most unorganized company I've ever worked for and to them, you are valued or appreciated. You are a work horse, not a human. They are two faced about everything and no matter how hard you try, you will not please them."
bad,"Run the other way, poor management, long days, late trucks, way too much backstock, out of dates sitting in the backstock with sales counselor not writing them up"
bad,"overworkrd not knowing when your working they tret you like . slave and question every decision "
bad,"bad hours, no room for advancement, very little communication, unfriendly. unorganized. glaad i dont work there anymore.................................."
bad,Long hours with little or no help. Management does nothing to help but threatens with write ups and firing if you don't adhere to the rules. Objectives too high to achieve.
bad,They don't care about training you they just care that they have bodies in the seats and when you don't do something right they just yell. The hardest part is just trying to get through the day honestly.
bad,Don't get your schedule until Thursday night and then it's never right. They give you way too many stores to service in one day and don't pay you enough for what you are doing.
bad,"Today Mondelez wriggled out of paying their Sales teams their hard earned bonus.  "
bad,"Horrible environment. Spoken down to almost daily concerning every aspect of the job. Laid off after producing better numbers than long term employees.  Boss told me to take PTO days that were scheduled, after telling me I was losing my job and now the company won't pay me for them. Some employees were treated better than others. District sales manager wouldn't come out to help anyone-too far of a drive with a company car."
bad,"No room for progression, have holidays off but have to work the day before and after, expected to report to work even in inclement weather, have to deal with store personnel on a power trip"
bad,"Fun job to be out and about every day, stocking shelves, removing out dated product along with getting to know each of the store managers and gaining their trust in  putting up appropriate displays."
bad,"Would like a job where I can utilize my degree in Business Administration. I do not feel that I will ever get promoted. If I'm lucky I get 20 hours a week, I cant live off of that"
bad,"I worked for this company and did not have a very good experience. I worked 7 days a week most of the time, although U never worked more than 30 hours. Since there is a lot of driving I paid more for gasoline in my car than I made in a week. I was hired on with paid mileage, but then I was told that I could either not get paid my mileage or transfer to a different area."
bad,Very physical with long hours.  Hated it and the people sucked.  Not a team environment at all.
bad,"The management is incompetent, expects results that are clearly not attainable. Poor management support out in the field. No direction. Hired as part time and then required to work full time hours. No flexibility and disorganized company."
bad,"I originally worked for Kraft and was working for the company through out the transition from Kraft to Mondelez International.  While working for Kraft I worked harder than ever as both a Sales Associate and a Sales Representative but I learned a lot and felt like I was working towards something and building a career.  After working for the company for almost two years I left my role in the Minneapolis market and was rehired as a Sales Associate in the Phoenix market.  My spouse took a new position with his company and due to his transfer I needed to transfer as well. That's is where my experience went down hill, starting with the fact that I was not able to transfer my position I was treated like a brand new employee and forced to start over and take a demotion or nothing at all.  I was disappointed that even though I worked for a nationwide company there was no support for an employee in good standing looking to transfer.  In addition to that unfortunately there were some major differences between the two markets.  I have never been treated as poorly as I was treated working in the Phoenix market.  It was so disheartening after working hard and seeing the results from my hard work in one market to come to another market and feel like I was forced to leave due to the way I was treated.  Management was very young lacked experience, there were several instances where management crossed the line of professionalism but they were never held accountable.  My manager in particular talked down to me on a regular basis and thought it was acceptable to discuss the fact that I was pregnant"
bad,Started as sales rep in Maryland and moved forward with company to account manager of grocery direct
bad,I worked for this company since the 1990s. Nabisco was great! Best job in the world. Mondelez took over in 2012. Nothing but abuse from the managers and the new Mondelez international. Expected to work on your own time as over time hours will be taking away. Pension and Bonus are a thing of the past.Be your own Doctor because their medical is like not having any at all. Threats daily and abusive slandering from managers. Filed a complaint which was over looked by HR. After leaving vacation pay and over time hours never paid.They are still holding my 401k hostage. Don t believe the lies this company went from hero to zero and lawsuits are coming.
bad,Very low pay and way to much responsibility the Sales Reps make all the money and the Merchandisers do all the work.Every store u venture in is always mad at Nabisco way to much product in back rooms do to over ordering and distros.Managment is terrible most of them have no business being in the positions there in.The best part about working for Mondeleze is the drive home!
bad,"Employed on a 6 month contract but my contract was unfairly terminated  in front of the whole office before being marched/escorted off site in such a criminal manner but two people who completely lacked emotion or care in the world. Experienced a great deal of discrimination, favouritism, lack of management and respect. Implied job security for duration of contract but got rid of 5 people with a snap of the fingers, with poor and weak reasons."
bad,Was misinformed told 25 hours now told cover full time people not right or fair they get full time hours plus BENIFITS part time does not you can’t live off people’s full time take vacation or sick wont pay your bills kept my days open not for this I have to live too will have work other job because misinformed when I was hired  people go stock shelves for Walmart Jewel think they are boss of you rude
bad,This place is one of the most unorganized facilities in Atlanta ga. I was a line manager at this place and I would not recommend it to anyone. This company is ran by 3 blind mice like the children's song. The business unit managers have applesauce for brains.  The uncertainty is terrible!!!! Cant live life with so much uncertainty!!!!!
bad,If you have a family this would probably not be a good job for you. The hours you work are very inconsistent and your schedule fluctuates every week. Not only that you have to use your own car to drive from various locations.
bad,Horrible place to work don’t trust management they lie right to you’re face same goes for the sales representative all they care about is hitting numbers.
bad,Mondelez could be a great company to work for but they still have too many good old boys in lead positions that ensure their kind of people are promoted. Minorities will have a difficult time advancing past Supervisor positions.
bad,Working at the company means going to numerous meetings in a day with no value added. Management is very biased and treats people unfairly and plays favorites. There is no work life balance. There is a reason why they have such high turn over rates with supervisors.
bad,"A typical l day at work would depend on the store schedule.  Most days the managers were very helpful. Others would be upset with upper management and take it out on you.  Discussing issues with managers would not solve any problems, in many cases it added to them.  There was little to no motivation from the managers.  When you work hard there is no type of encouragement.  Most of the other employees rushed through their assignment with product just thrown on the shelves not neat and if you took your time to do a good job, I would be accused of using too much time in order to get overtime."
bad,"Went through 2 area managers in the matter of a few months. Never knew what you were doing the next day until sometimes 11 at night. Wont pay for all hours worked.  They also hold back on your mileage, will cut about 100 miles off every week that you should have been paid.  Also will call while you are working to have you drive to another town and cover for bosses who were too hungover to work. The place had the most uneducated back woods employees working for them.  It's not worth it.  They hire high school dropouts to be the new bosses for the ones who have all quit."
bad,"very bad morale. management is horrible "
bad,"Typical 5 stores and allow some much time per store according to Wise program.  Suppose to be an eight hour day, but it never works that way unless you curve corners and service at each store."
bad,"Job advancement at Mondelez is tough especially if your a white male.  If you are female or have a hispanic name you will move up through the company in no time.  Females can go from a part time merchandiser to a director in no time.  "
bad,In this position you are on call 24/7. There is zero work-life balance. You have unrealistic expectations because you manage over 60 employees and have to please over 150 grocery stores. The district managers place all of their responsibilities on you as well. Mondelez doesn't care about their employees and only wants to cut cost. The culture is horrendous and the objectives continue to get hire so the company doesn't have to pay bonuses. Constant restructuring and motivates by fear. STAY AWAY!!!
bad,"looking for full-time work. I do not feel that I have a future with this company, would like to utilize my bachelors degree."
bad,Work is fast paced and days go by quickly. Company is currently going through a re-structure which makes advancing your career extremely difficult.
bad,"Worked at a Chicago suburb location manufacturing Triscuits."
bad,"Es una basura en especial el cap de cuautitlán el gerente es un despota acosador y la demás dirección  solo se la pasa de fiesta y haciendo negocios turbios con los recursos adicionales que da la empresa es decir con la degustación."
bad,No home time been over a year and I haven’t touched a truck yet they slave you in the warehouse no sick time your sick and miss it’s a write up OSHA should come check the warehouse it’s not ventilated it’s hot working 12/6 a week your treated like trash mangers don’t follow the union contract and high seniority tries to bend the contract to there favor
bad,"The people within this company will not give you a proper opportunity to grow or advance. Definitely favouritism is a problem. Also, the job is very labor intensive and you will feel really exhausted after a day of putting out merchandise. I not just being negative I'm speaking facts because I was one who was over qualified, but did not receive a chance to prove my worth. Sothis"
bad,"This company gave me the run around but good. The first warning sign was when I told them in my interview that I can only drive an automatic vehicle (driving was required for my job), they said that it wouldn’t be a problem and that they could organise an automatic vehicle for me. The vehicle I was issued was a manual and they expected me to drive it from day one. After jumping through several hoops to get an automatic vehicle organised for me, they gave me one on a temporary basis. In the 9 months I worked for them I had four company cars (as a result I now have a £758.00 tax bill that I have to pay because going through that many company cars in such a short time). Had they listened and kept to their word and organised an automatic transmission vehicle in the first place, it would have saved time, angst and money on both mine and their behalf."
bad,"If you have a job don’t apply to Mondelez "
bad,"Poor management that likes to micromanage from a distance. Never listens to whats happening on the street. They know it all, and don't want to hear your opinion."
bad,I was told when I was hired that I was part-time as soon as the holiday season was over I literally received maybe 1 day every 2 weeks. Then the one day I did work I made an error the supervisor not only texted me very nasty messages but called me and was very nasty after I offered to go back and correct my mistakes!
bad,Stay away.  Poor management company doesn’t care about you as a individual very bias.   Job security in this location is all about who you know.  No room for advancement
bad,"This company expects you to be very quick paced and does not  care about the complications that may cause you to get off track, sickness or otherwise."
bad,I am so glad I am out of there was there 11 years and only stayed for the pay and benefits but they started cutting the benefits and did not want to pay what they were in the beginning and they raised rates that you couldn't make because the machines ran horrible. And mechanics threw a fit If they had to work.
bad,Management at this location is toxic and I would never recommend people to work here. The union at this location only cares about helping family get hired and moving up the ladder. You will make good money but don't make plans during the week because you won't make them. The current manager is the most two faced person Ive ever worked for.
bad,"If you are looking forward to getting in there and to start driving, forget about it! Could be a couple of years before you will drive a truck. I would highly NOT recommend this place."
bad,"Constant restructure bad business results. Many people on H1B Visas and do not know the US laws. Cut to the bone and then in a year realize that they went too far and hire back. "
bad,Some poor management- difficult to move forward in career unless you know the right people. Work hours are too much- 12 hour shifts every day and weekends.
bad,"The job itself was easy I thought, but the minimum hours and management culture was poor. I didn't feel valued as an employee, and I didn't feel trusted. There is no room for advancement."
bad,They talk to you in a nice nasty way the hours are terrible and they are very unorganized as a company it self your hours can be low to none and they'll end your day out of no where i would never recommend this company to anyone
bad,"Working with a company for almost 12 years at the end of 2015 makeup sales rep salaries back by 5 to $6,000"
bad,work culture is horrible driven by management who only look after their own skins. they speak the right language but act the opposite. no focus from a strategic management perspective and always fire drills. dysfunctional systems and not willing to invest.
bad,Management does not care about it's employee's in any way shape or form. The only thing they care about is how much product are we putting out. The moral is very low. Hours are horrible. The only reason I stay is for the pay.
bad,This is company is a complete joke.  Upper management puts way too much pressure on their reps to execute retail strategies in a tough and demanding industry and often set their reps up for failure.  They clearly don't respect their ethics and values of how to be a top tier company.
bad,"Work life balance not there Hours are 8.30-5 your start time is from when you get to your first call, drive time not included so if your an hour from patch that’s your issue.  Apart from Monday for cash and carry and Friday slightly earlier finish if your cash and carry are nice .If you start late finish early this is flagged on a report and you must justify. If you are going to meet your manager you must cover calls prior or same week, incase you don’t manage your call rate. High hot pressured environment, independents are not nice people anymore."
bad,Good pay but if working part time not guaranteed hrs to help support your family. Lack of communication on between managers and regular employees. Dont like to rotate products on shelf so constantly finfing out code products by at least month or more.
bad,"Hired through temp agency. Was given $16 an hour during the summer term. Work starts early from 7-3. Training was terrible. As soon as you make a mistake, you're being yelled at even though you've never been at that position ever. Was even told by my trainer that ""I may be more suited to sanitation"". Many mistakes that should've been told to you prior are only told when you do the mistake. Resulting in another earful from the line leader. Have been threatened with being sent home if we weren't doing a good job (despite still being in training). Afterwards, you then realize the amount of hours given wildly varys. Sometimes you may be working all five days. Then, other weeks it may only be two Overall, pay is fantastic but the training and work hours are terrible. So if you feel like you can suffer through the workplace this is the perfect job for you"
bad,Management will stab you in the back and lie at the drop of a hat. They are not too be trusted ....and H.R. is the same...  If offered a job there please run as fast as you can.
bad,I was fine with part time... 20 hours... Well it was more like 5 hours maybe 10 tho... I went to just 2 days a week and it was better for a week but then boom. Get up at 5am to make it to destination on time and everytime... Done and going home in 2 hours or so. Went to 1 day a week and this last one... 4 hours. Not even worth waking up for. Much less driving 30 miles to get there.
bad,I learned it is important  to come to work prepared  to do your job.a typicall day is up and down and no consistency in product. Management  dose not have a clue and are not people friendly. The culture is very few people want to truly learn there job and the managers are hard on the good workers and not hard on the bad workers. The hardest part of the job is the heat and dealing with incompetent the enjoyable  part is the pay. m
bad,Empresa vive uma constante restruturação o que gera uma instabilidade constante entre os funcionários.
bad,They made empty promises and were not diverse enough. The work like balance was non existent and the wanted to you to work on company paid holidays. They were not supportive with personal growth.
bad,"Trucks seem to always be late or broken down. You can work 10 to 12 hour days, with NO OVERTIME allowed!!!  They sit in there office all day and watch your GPS tracking. You can’t even sit in your car for 5 minutes between stops and they call you!! YOU NEVER SEE YOUR BOSSES OUT IN THE FIELD TO HELP.. THEY JUST SIT IN THERE OFFICES AND MICRO MANAGE YOU!!! They have no trust in you at all.. Your job can be fun but Management ruins everything and makes your job miserable!! Would not recommend this job to anyone!!  They don’t pay you enough for gas, you travel a lot!! Especially when gas prices sky rocket."
bad,"Understaffed, forced to work alternative work schedule.  Machines and building in need of repairs with no parts to do the repairs or enough staff to perform repairs.  Unequal treatment of employees and no longer a culture of employees being an important asset to the company.  Treated as if you are a replaceable object with a human resource department that does not follow company policy and allows management to create policies that suit their needs. This facility used to be a great place to work and a Rockford icon."
bad,Lack of experience on managements part makes warehouse tasks unnecessarily difficult on a day to day basis I highly recommend looking for another job elsewhere the money is good but I’d rather be happy making less money than miserable making more money.
bad,"Retail sales industry has seen many changes from reorganization to   combining several vendors into a single brokerage/merchandising position."
bad,"Stressful environment, Poor planning and poor execution of IL6S by management.The best part of the day is going home. To many times information from management is vague at best. Direct questions to management are not answered."
bad,"You well not have a single day go by when you are not working. Your phone will ring, you will receive emails everyday and they will be required to do immediately. they give you the worst staff they can and expect you to complete everything with them. If you ask for help or assistance they manager just reads off a prefilled sheet with responses."
bad,"The processes are clumsy, line managers are nothing but ordinary workers who have proven to be able to bully/push people and most things don't seem to make sense but are simply done because someone has said so."
bad,Compañía sin rumbo y sólo enfocada en la reducción de costes
bad,Everyone tries to be to involved with your personal life instead of focusing on improvements around company. The plant manager always welcome ideas but the workers are to busy being involved in other things
bad,"What a great company 😒 worked 5 years for this company and worked my way up from a temp to a top payed reach truck driver, after 5 years of working my butt off for these people 22 of us were cut due to miss management 😠 would I ever work for them again I think not or at least while the management is still the same 😠"
bad,The company doesn't offer any room for advancement. Management and Senior reps treat those in lower positions horrible.
bad,"I was treated very poorly by the sales . It was ultimately the result of me not responding to his flirations. The outcome was me being given impossible workloads, slandered terribly, and finally I was fired. Horrible experience."
bad,"Not a very pleasant place to work, especially with a down economy all cost cutting efforts have sacked motivation. No consideration for employees and expectation is to work many many hours with no processes"
bad,Nabisco was the greatest company to work for until the kraft foods merger and then Mondelez split.     The constant focus on cost cutting and extreme pressure on everyone took all the enjoyment and fun away.
bad,They care nothing for you if you're not management. Experience and loyalty means nothing. Apply elsewhere as it will be less stressful. They really don't care.
bad,Quando entrei em depressão pediram pra eu procurar Deus
bad,"I wasted 15 years of my life with this company. I’m not just a disgruntled employee, I ended up quitting because they didn’t understand/care about the responsibilities of raising not 1 but 2 special needs children, and would not work with me on start/end times "
bad,Typical day starts around 8 am and ends around 3 or 4 pm. Workplace culture is all about speed. Management wants the job done asap and dosen't care to hear any excuses. I learned that this was a job that I would probably been better doing about 20 years ago.
bad,"you deal with a large amount of complex information, a lack of company time to process.  accompanied by a feeling of uselessness, you are measured on things that you have no control over.  "
bad,"Poor management, cutthroat, people throw each other under the bus. They put you in places and shifts that make your life difficult. Most of the shop stewards only look out for the people that look like them."
bad,"Good co workers"
bad,This used to be a great company to work for before the Kraft merger/split to Mondelez. The company is all about saving money and budget cutting you would think they are going out of business. Used to be able to get job done in 42hrs now it's get the same job done in 40 leaving you to sometimes work on your own time to get the job done and keep service level satisfied in the stores. I deploy system is a complete joke. It tells you how long to spend in a store not taking into account the obstacles that come into play every day. 1 min over has to be approved by mgt. If you have good merchandisers it can make you run your territory correctly get some bad ones or they call out its on you and you will always be running and gunning to just the basic job done. Always getting calls from stores looking for service even on days off which is a result in budget cuts and I deploy system cutting service level in the stores. Unrealistic sales objectives. RDR always pushing their dm's to write up or fire people. Unless you are young and fresh out of college don't even think of moving up. They are the ones on the fast track. Pretty much pushed out the old guard that actually understood how to treat employees and customers for these young people that are all booksmart but no people skills which leaves everyone with bad morale. Needs I say more. Unless you are up for long hrs and up for the challenges then stay away!
bad,This company is the meaning of corporate greed. They cut jobs in their American bakeries and send thousands of jobs to Mexico.
bad,"I worked at Mondelez International full-time (More than 3 years)"
bad,"A typical day of work for a Sales Rep is Monday through Friday and on call anytime you are off.  Does not matter if you are on vacation, a weekend, or holiday.  Stores call, manager expects you to keep the company phone on you at all times.  Good is always not good enough. "
bad,grind you into the ground till you cant take it anymore told you will work 7 days a week for the next year or go work somewere els
bad,"At Toledo Ohio Mondelez, there is a epidemic of griping about anything and anyone, maintenance shop. The lead guys lead the way and teach the younger ones to complain daily as if were a sport."
bad,"This is a job that may possibly,  depending on you which location you work, be a good or bad experience.  "
bad,Worked there  almost 5 years ..too much poor management and lazy coworkers...great pay but to much forced overtime ...no new union contract within the Last 3 years ..poorly handled.
bad,"Field sales representative is overrated. "
bad,Sad to see such a great place turn so bad.  Some truly great people treated so poorly.  More often than not contradicting safety by saying it costs too much.  Zero concern for the well being of their people.
bad,"Turn and burn job, avoid it at all costs!"
bad,"Company does not provide 401 k to full time Merchandisers but does for Sales Reps and above.  Company is constantly hiring.  Low pay and really small raises once a year that do not keep of with the high cost of living.  Great place to gain experience if you have none.  Job consists of easy work that is hard on your body, and long days due to heavy backstock at every store."
bad,It's a very hard job. Very physical in stores throwing freight. Never enough help and the pay is not that great. You ste on a GPS system so they micro manage everything you do.
bad,"Cut throat environment.  A typical day at work was very stressful.  When I returned, after having my son, they had me on a forced midnight shift for over time.  Management was backstabbing and underhanded.  Most enjoyable part of my job was went I left for home."
bad,"I have worked here for a little over 2 years, and from the time I started until now it has changed drastically. The supervisors and upper management don't care about you in any way. They force people to work 16 hour days(almost everyday), then when you have an accident or past out at work they say it's your fault. There is absolutely no job security there, in fact they are about to lay 600 employees off in the early new year. The pay and benefits are excellent, but sometimes that isn't enough to keep people."
bad,"Do not work here, this use to be a great place to work. They have completely ruined the family atmosphere that made it fun. They ni longer care about their employees."
bad,"Empresa agradável de trabalhar, organizada e pontual com o funcionário em relação a pagamento."
bad,The company is lacking in process and control structure.  There is no defined process for work flow.  Managers don't understand that coordination and cooperation is key to getting things done.  Communication is another issue that only adds to the issues.
bad,Just the management I don’t like but it’s a good job. The men working there with me were cool. The job is very easy powerjack is a plus make your day easier.
bad,just not a fun job. Not fulfilling in anyway. Pushed around by grocery managers and Mondelez District Managers. Dont care about employees just about money.
bad,"llegaba alrededor de las 8 am empezaba a checar mi producto en las tiendas y si me había llegado mas mercancía después empezaba a sacar producto pero por departamento linea de cajas , lácteos y por ultimo abarrotes aprendí a ser organizado y a trabajar veloz ya que si no el tiempo me comía y no tenia dirección ya q estaba de tienda en tienda la parte mas difícil ea negociar con los jefes o gerentes en cuestión de pedidos lo que mas me gusto de esta empresa es que aprendí mucho de ella gracias"

bad,"Affrètement amont/aval, création et mise en ligne des plannings réceptions et expéditions, gestion des incidents de livraison, suivi des litiges, analyse des ruptures, gestions des aléas du transport..."
bad,People are very warm. The company prides itself as the best place to work. The company is very generous in sharing Mondelez products to employees whenever there is an activity.
bad,"très bonne culture d'entreprise, entreprise jeune et dynamique."
bad,Like any company be on your best behavior and you will be fine.  However if you make too many friends and forget about your work they will find a way to fire you.
bad,They work you hard. Time sensitive work. Don’t promote from within. Raises are very small in cents. Worked 5 yrs to get to $12 hr. Wrote orders worked several stores. No appreciated.
bad,"Set up to fail from the start. Train you in easy areas and docks. Send you out alone in the Bronx, low bridges and bad areas. They can't wait to start a paper trail on you and will combine them with future write ups.  Union jas no pull."
bad,It was a horrible place to work for in 2016. I would be gone anywhere from 12-16+ hours per day. Then when you make the person above you mad they cut your hours to nothing for at least a few weeks. I only worked 2 months for them. I am still owed my last paycheck and last mileage reimbursement check. It has been 3 years.
bad,"Union environment Enough Said"
bad,"As I get inside the shop I should do my flow walk then pack my snack que, trough the day am packing shelves in the ieyl, I have to write short dated stock and take out the returns then do costumers service."
bad,"Good company to work for and to live with in the current environment,"
bad,I read the reviews going in and they were all right. You're treated great coming in and then they turn around and walk on you like a floor mat.
bad,everyday was the same come in start up and make good quality product I learned how to keep the machine running and how to clean and maintain the machine . my co workers were really hard working people that helped get the job done .the hardest part of the day is when the machine breaks down is trying to figure out what the problem is to get it back up and running
bad,There is a high turnover rate within the company. Upper management needs an overhaul. I worked there for over 3 years with high reviews and was never offered a full time position even after applying. I would not recommend this company period
bad,Hours change everyday also do the routes. No pay for being on call. All trucks have cameras and they call you in the office for every little issue they see on the camera. Almost as if the cameras are not for safety but to just watch you all day. Horrible place to work. People who have been working here 10years plus are quitting left and right!
bad,"They promise 20 hrs a week but will only give you 10 or less and gripped about that. You have to watch your mileage because the company  is bad about not paying you for it .... they will use your personal internet and cell phone for business  and not pay you for them..... they require high dollar car insurance that you wouldn't make enough money to pay for it ....."
bad,A lot of inknown with this company. Seems like management is very sneaky and always wanting to reprimand.  Way to much interference with management daily to get your work done.  They definitely are youth oriented.  Do not want older employees. This company in my view is rotten and you will not feel like you have job security.  Don’t waste your time. Always changing protocols and threatening with write ups- joke!!! Wait until management gets their turn - it will come.
bad,It is a fast moving job and keeps you on your toes salary is not bad but the work can be over whelming you have to have good communication with your reps and managers or work will be hard
bad,"Was lied to from day one by the merchandising manager. Sales reps are dishonest, horrible coworkers.  The worse group of people I ever worked with because they had no character."
bad,"This company overworks it's employees, and does not do reviews to assist the employee in future advancement. They did allow adequate break periods, but the layout of the facility left it almost impossible to use the full break period. My coworkers had a bad attitude, and did not like helping new employees.The hardest part about the job was the repetitive motion and demand put on you by other long term employees."
bad,"full time but rarley got 40 hours never knew from one day to the next were you were going to work"
bad,"They knew I would have to resign and could not hide the relief when I resigned. Disappointed and discouraged. The manager was surprisingly confident and cold. Anyway it is one of my two worst jobs and wonder how they get away with treating people that may be different than themselves like outsiders and dismissed the knowledge, experience and enthusiasm they brought to Company and their position. Sad."
bad,"While your direct supervisor may understand what you are dealing with, maybe the manager above that position, anybody above there is most likely never been in your position and has no idea how your job works or how to do it. But, they know they want you to do it faster and know what number needs to be hit for them to get a bonus and you better hit that number! This company is number driven, like most, but they don't hide it so well when you're in it. Good luck in stepping up or any forward movement either, popular kids only get to the front of the class!"
bad,"At first everything is great, management will work with schedule and is very understanding then at some point it all changes. Everything u do is questioned and your constantly second guessed. Management is so disconnected from what is really going on in stores. They expect the world but give u 2 hours to do it, and God forbid u want to take a day off. Hahahah.. which is sad cause the company it's self is actually pretty good but ruined by horrible managers who just see numbers and don't see reality.."
bad,"Much confusion from leadership creates unrealistic work expectations."
bad,It was a fast paced atmosphere. It was nice that I got to be a team leader. I wish the job was full time and more of a guarantee lasting job.Made alot of friends.
bad,A Typical day was going to the assigned stores in my territory and completing what was assigned at each of those stores in a time period which was impossible to do the work needed in that time frame.  I was not able to give quality service to the stores as needed and many times the part time helpers assigned to helped me would not show up and there was no backup plan to help thus making the day 2-4 hours longer than planned.  The managers had no management experience and were flying by the seat of their pants in trying to run the team.
bad,Péssima gestão. Pessoas despreparadas e a ambição atual da empresa destruiu o clima organizacional
bad,"Mittelmäßige Vergütung, Work-Life Balance gibt's nicht, immer nur mehr Arbeit"
bad,"A typical work day consists of working a fast paced assembly line, packing perishables, placing them on pallet preparing for shipment."
bad,"A empresa é boa de se trabalhar, porém não valoriza seus funcionários que realmente vestem a camisa, e seu salário é muito baixo em relação ao custo de vida daqui que está muito alto."
bad,"many only care about themselves, management will throw you under the bus to cover for their mistakes. only concerned about numbers.  constantly lying to customers"
bad,Wasn’t impressed working fir this company!  Took advantage of employees and their hard work. Seemed like the harder you worked the more they expected from you!
bad,"As with all agency work ... perm workers treat you like garbage. Expect you to work  like you’ve worked there for 5 + years. Frequent layoffs, low pay, no benefits. Mostly East Indians .. not outwardly friendly ( insecure about job perm) . Only good thing is the free cookies, candy you receive  at  Halloween and the discount at their store."
bad,"This is the most cutthroat job I've ever had. The sales reps will expect you to live, breathe, eat, sleep, Nabisco. I was trained poorly, and was demoted because of it. I didn't find out until another member of my team told me, not my immediate superior."
bad,Lack of communication between managment & employees. Disorganized. What was suppose to be 20hours a week was more like 40-50hrs. No overtime pay. No benefits.
bad,"Terrible management, only worried about money! Want to stay happy? Stay away from here! Worked there one month and couldn’t take anymore. Foreman pick and choose who to give hours to."
bad,"This job requires you to give your life to the company. Excellent job for a individual that is single and has no family. If you have the time, it is a ok job."
bad,"One thing is what it says it is and another is what it actually does. There is little to no innovation, and internal politics rule. It is unfortunately not the company it once was and I sincerely hope it finds a renewed purpose it can actually deliver on."
bad,"Worked here for 8 years. The culture is terrible, they use you up and spit you out. Work life balance is non existent. Management was completely working for themselves, getting whatever the could out of employees then letting them go. you were expected to work on your Territory until all work is done but only charge the company for 40 hours a week."
bad,nothing big to say just another slave company in the world with very bad management slave job and really bad payment. nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing...
bad,"Great Products but poor management"
bad,More concern about hours than servicing accounts. Not enough time to work back stock and any deliveries. Not enough time to properly rotate product on shelves. Lots of damaged product on shelves and displays.
bad,"You work until your job is complete, regardless of how many hours. System issues are constant which cause for very long hours.  Management is very rarely on site during our work hours - which can cause chaos, but can be less stressful - it is a catch 22 issue."
bad,Was a great place to work before they went through multiple restructures and really downsized the finance function. Had the potential to really be a fun working environment but most of the employers are super stressed and unable to keep up with work requirements.
bad,Was a temp and got treated poorly. No chance of getting hiring in. Would have stayed on if there was any shot at getting hired in they kept telling us they were going to hire soon and it never happened.
bad,"workplace culture is negative"
bad,"Work placement was fine, good set up and working team. 0 hour contract with no guarentees re future/prospects + the following working week. no stability"
bad,Management at this facility have made many decisions that have cost the company a lot of money.  The alternative wok schedule is a joke.  It has cost the company more money and coverage is not available when problems arise.  Employee moral couldn't become any lower.  Management expects employees to have no life or family time outside of work.
bad,demasiado buena fue un gusto estar ai muy buen ambiente laboral yo volveria sin problema esa empresa
bad,"Management on team 275 is the worst! Both managers on the team are underqulified, and have no business runung a team. They have no experience in selling, merchandising, or handling people. Its almost like their supervisors gave them a book on how to manage. The only problem is they dont know how to read. Rep. who I worked for in Watchung was great, and very experienced. They made his life a living hell."
bad,"As a Merchandiser for Nabisco, you go into multiple grocery stores per day and service them; this includes: packing out product, selling incremental displays, and general service to the store based on their needs. If you are lucky, the management of the individual stores will not give you a hard time during your pack out, and you can move on to the next store until the day is done. Mondelez, like many retail companies, is constantly putting out new products and bulk distributing it to stores, sometimes to the displeasure of their customer. Upper management feigns obliviousness and leaves it to the people on the ground to deal with the backlash."
bad,"My current workplace is actually quite fun, it is an MNC but function like a SME.  I have learned how to work with different levels of people from Dialect speaking to English speaking.  I have also learned to manage all level of co-worker from 20 to 50.  The hardest part of my job is work-life-balance, as I have a high turner role in my team, and this has make me a very hands on manager.  Due to this,  I also have been trained on risk discovery and good interview skills. My most enjoyable part of my job is to organize and 'getting the team' to work as one team."
bad,Work day varied depending on your sucking up abilities. If you are good at it you were given a good route. I learned that teamster local 150 has no backbone. Management is unproffessional and verbally abusive to some of the less favored employees. Co workers are scared and will rat each other out. You will never be full-time unless you are good at shining things. The most enjoyable thing is when the weekend arrives.
bad,"Which they don't give you for the amount of running around they make you do. Many store locations will have you in there for hours working and they will team you up with another person."
bad,"Mondelez does not value their employees at all. Overworked underpaid. Minority advancement over skilled advancement. Pay does not match work skills, I do not recommend this job"
bad,"Fast-paced labor-intensive position. The Sales Representative position requires planning each day's activities, a strong relationship with store managers & a willingness to perform manual labor task."
bad,Your hours get cut when new people get hired and it's alot of work that has to be done at each stores. You get trained incorrect on some things. The management sucks because they looking out for each other and not the employees at all. Just a bunch of bull . I wouldn't advise anyone to work here.
bad,La valoración que le doy es negativa ya que no hay buen ambiente de trabajo
bad,It isn't a bad job. We do everything remotely or by email. We would have quarterly meetings for our job group. It requires driving to and from store accounts for your territory. Varies from 3 to 4 stops a day to possibly 7-8 or more. The bonus structure fluctuates from  year to year. The advancement is somewhat slow as most people stay in their position for some time. The interpersonal communication is very good. The hardest part was feeling very on my own as far as help. It is hard to get additional help as my territory was away from the main group in general.
bad,"none. I don't have a any thing to add ."
bad,"Was promised a full time position when one opened up in my area. Immediately expressed interest as I have been with the company for 2 1/2 years now. I was denied the position due to being ""slow"" when I first started over 2 years ago during training, even with phenomenal reviews from multiple sales reps on performance. They hired somebody from outside of the company."
bad,Work was easy at times but could also be stressful. A typical workday started off fast paced and slowed down throughout the day. there really wasn't a hard pt of the job.
bad,"While b2b retail seems to be a job which would be relatively easy due to the consistent need for product, the headache of the nuances is not worth it. If you're willing to work 14hour days to get snapped at by demanding clients who think you owe them your life (Walmart/Target/Winco) for little to no working compensation, then this is the job for you."
bad,"Arrive at the grocery store stock the shelves and displays and go to the next account. Very simple but very physical job. "
bad,Demasiada persecusion de la vida privada de los trabajadores
bad,"Rule by Fear/ Management is incompetent and does not feel it necessary to work with unions or anyone that is not upper management. Core company values are not important. "
bad,At this place I've learned that some peoples work faster then other. Very easy work it was all about working at a fast past working well with others. No matter what safety always first.
bad,"The typical work day can vary, one day can be short and sweet but others can seem like it takes much longer.  It all depends on what has happened or what has to happen while at any given store.  I can say that one of the most rewarding parts of my position is interacting with the various customers I come across, helping find the item they are looking for or simply encouraging them to try something they may not have tried before."
bad,At the moment Mondelez is undergoing a reorganisation - for juniors it is almost impossible to keep your position or to gain a new position within the company.
bad,"The region suffers from poor supply chain management, hindering the ability to capture market growth opportunities across East Africa."
bad,It was ok to work there just don't like the union they had was not for the good hard working people
bad,"Challenging environment with constant change."
bad,There's is too much pressure and demanding service while the company does care about our needs in the company less salary no uniforms for over a years we buying pants for our company
bad,"When I first joined Mondelez, it was a great place to work full of joy and fulfilling work. Then management began changing and the culture began to deteriorate. We no longer followed our values, because we wanted to do things faster-better-CHEAPER. People who expressed concern about the shift were ostracized and often terminated under suspicious conditions (e.g., being older than 50 and the only one eliminated as part of a restructure). It was very sad to see it deteriorate so."
bad,People are constantly competing for positions in a very bad way. The company hires whoever the factory workers favour. The pay is low for the amount of work they have.
bad,Uma empresa muita boa e com treinamento bom para sua desenvoltura.
bad,Management does not care about worker's life outside of the job. Advancing is very difficult they like to give you a new job without title so they don't have to pay you and can move you down easily.
bad,New managers are like they are in a revolving door. They keep bringing in melenials and sales representitives to be managers. Bad decisions and pressure from above make it worse. They dont care how long they keep you; they have an overtime bucket they dig out of.
bad,"only positive is the pay, its very fast paced and starting hours are very early and getting home very late no work or life balance . insurance is ok and its a union job which means all vacation is taken and leaving nothing left for anyone else and although I agree with them getting first bids they are allowed all vacation taking all 6 weeks at a time and their is nothing left for guys that been ther 2 or 3 years in. if you like money its a great job."
bad,"The Good-Awesome Insurance and cost, company car, and bonuses."
bad,"emploi de merchandiseur "
bad,Small plant and I do not want my review published.  This is not something I feel good with right now and do not want to cause me issues when trying to apply for other jobs.
bad,"The route manager was young and did not manage the sales reps very good.  Pallets and pallets of product brought in.  Items not rotated regularly.  Pay was good but to much work for part-time.  If you like physical work all day without a break, this job is for you!"
bad,The expectation to work around the clock due to poor culture and improperly maintained equipment makes any kind of work life balance impossible. The Union agreement makes it very difficult to hold anyone accountable and corporate's reluctance to allocate money to detreating equipment makes it difficult to manage through the chaos.
bad,The workers are not compensated well at all for the physical and time demand of the job.  They should be paid much greater for hustle they are required to perform.
bad,"They give you too many stores to work in one day which can become overwhelming and stressful, and then talk down to you if you ask for help with them. They scold you for going into overtime even though they offer little help for your stores, so of course you’re going to go into overtime. I always worked hard to make sure my stores were stocked and looked nice but then am told I didn’t do enough so what’s the point of working hard if they don’t recognize it? Condensending managers and sales reps. You don’t get any actual breaks except for when you’re just driving to the next store. I’m very unhappy here and am trying to find a new job."
bad,"I have worked retail for over 15 years, been in charge of a crew, worked as part of one, and worked entirely on my own. I'm an incredibly hard worker capable of pushing 80 cases an hour depending on what product is going up. I have no qualms working hard. What I do have an issue with is when I'm working as hard as you do for this company and you get little to nothing in return. "
bad,"Days arent consistent all the time, some days are different hours based on delivery times of trucks on different routes, most of the sales reps are very nice and helpful, mostly everyone in the company has been there for a while and are all very nice and helpful."
bad,"Management team is really poor., by next year I expect there to be major job loss at this company.This company has great product line but always has to many issues."
bad,"Desafortunadamente es una empresa que compro a chicltes adams, nos quito las prestaciones y beneficios que teniamos"
bad,Job cuts/re-engineering every year. Poor work-life balance. Fair compensation. No trust in senior management. Days started at 7am with conference calls and meetings - ended dealing with back-logged emails late at night.
bad,"This was a great place to work until we found out our jobs were being displaced, kind of. Most sales reps were offered a ""new"" position doing exactly what we had done before for literally over a third less pay, no company cars, and no 401k matching."
bad,"Job offer was advertised for Ogden UT, but was forced to travel to other cities that were way too far, and was hardly given any hours. I would be waiting around for weeks and weeks and maybe got a few hours if I was lucky. It was much better at Kellogg's before they stopped doing DSD. Do not recommend."
bad,"I have nothing to say here at Mondelez Inc,  a non friendly type of co workers you encounter in working within 5months. management are so rude that they have  to delay the employees salary for their onw needs."
bad,Dificultad de conciliar la vida familiar y la vida laboral. No me he sentido a gusto durante la estancia en la empresa.
bad,No room for advancement.Work life balance got better the last few years.Managers need training on how to handle difficult situations.
bad,"Hard work and drive doesn't take you anyware in this company, you just have to be brain dead to deal with poor leadership and any sort of accountability."
bad,"Great learning experience, being my first job in retail. Most days are fast paced, making the day go by a lot quicker. Usual day would go something like this- check in with various retail stores to ensure they are happy with product and displays throughout the sales floor. Merchandising as needed to ensure product always looks good on shelves and displays."
bad,"Diariamente viagens atendendo as lojas do roteiro estabelecido, adquirir uma experiência com exposição de produtos, e merchandising dos produtos que a Mondelez trabalha, que são de excelente qualidade, dos companheiros de trabalho, todos muito parceiros, espirito de equipe entre o grupo é característica positiva, das dificuldades para trabalhar, eram apenas técnicas como falta de mercadorias nas lojas por falhas na logística da empresa, dificultando assim meu trabalho em campo, ajuda de custo insuficiente para execução do roteiro era um problema constante."
bad,"À medida que a Gestão da empresa  Portugal se internacionalizou a paricipação nas decisões que moldavam e influenciavam o nosso trabalho desceram para níveis básicos transformando os cargos de gestão intermédia em meros executantes. Ao nível da equipa de vendas perdeu-se completamente a capacidade de criar respostas  adequadas às necessidades e particularidades dos clientes que, apesar de vivermos num país muito pequeno, têm um diversidade de produtos e mercados diversificado."
bad,"Work over 12+ hours daily due to poor management or lack of. Management makes job a lot harder then job job actually is. No growth within the company,"

bad,"You’ll be hired for a area close but be thrown around to other areas and swapped when they feel like it or a new upper management is hired. Some sales reps are good and down to earth, others are just there to hit a number even if the customer sales arnt there. Be prepared for backrooms full of product all over. You wont make enough money to make it a career but enough until you find a real career."
bad,"Empresa boa em relação a remuneração, porém menospreza os funcionários da região e desvaloriza a mão de obra local"
bad,There is no work-life balance. You get your schedule the night before at 5:00 p.m. If your delivery is late you are at a clock out and sit in your car until the delivery comes. Management is not supportive and does not listen.
bad,"I am no stranger to merchandising in grocery store environments. you have to have a certain personality to work within the confines each store gives you, as well as the expectation of your company. it can be quite a challenge to work with certain personalities that are never going to be satisfied with the work that you do even if you change what they do not like about your display."
bad,Current work conditions should be reviewed to improve overall work/life balance.  The position required constant problem solving and creating working relationships between logistics and sales.
bad,"Warning: different groups mean different managers and different work environments. However I found my opinion and experience is shared with more people: you may be offered training, management and flexibility, but working in UKAS/GMP regulated environment means it largely dependent on your managers to be trained and signed off to do and get what you need to advance in your job. Not to tell about being treated fairly and with respect."
bad,"Company used to a good place to work and I wanted to finish my career there. It is very much a micro managed job now. Ever since they started paying time and a half overtime, the job cannot be completed in the time they allow you to work. Employees have to find shortcuts in their jobs and it affects the quality of work."

The people are great very friendly and helpful but far too many minorities with poor English skills which is a safety concern. The facility itself is very poor, small cramped cafeteria with unappealing lunch options. Locker rooms are also small having to crawl over other people to get changed. Very old facility that needs to be relocated and updated. The pay is excellent and good benefits but not a company to grow with. Parking at the site is next to impossible so if you drive beware."
bad,"fast pace everything is right now . Employee must be able to perform more than one task at a time . I was able to acquire knowledge in 5 s , root cause , lean manufacturing, home setting . The job is not hard , however , you must focus on controlling your waste . For the most part if a person enjoy working with people it is a fun caring place to work"
bad,"Stressful, and lack of support, pressure to hurry, Customers were very supportive, and helpful. Enjoyment was the customer interaction and the innovation of new products. The hard part was being held to a phone for logging in and out of every customer and being held accountable for your time spent in the store."
bad,"O salário e beneícios são ótimos, mas o que peca é a promoção por indicação. "
bad,It is difficult to stay within the given hours each day. Supervisors say you will get help on route and the help either never comes or right when your finishing the job
bad,pay is nice its above minimum wage. you don't have a lot of contact with any supervisors and when you do its contradictory. hours claim to be flexible but are not
bad,"Mondelez é uma empresa multinacional que proporciona aprendizado  e tem flexibilidade, busca simplificar processos."
bad,Utilize phone to obtain work stops. Travel to stores to work truck deliveries and back stock. Utilize merchandising principles to maintain product fulfillment.
bad,"llegar atienda realizar actividades cotidianas actualmente cambio de tienda y pues a empezar con nuevos retos poca comunicacion con los demas compañeros pues cada quien ocupado en sus diversas actividades y enfocados en sus metas casi todos los dias son los mismos algunas ocasiones en las cuales hay ca,bio de rutina buena relacion con los jefes encargados de los diversos departamentos y pues el trabajo es bueno soloq siempre se busca una mejora economica para la familia"
bad,"Overall, Mondelez is a fair place to work.   The Sales and Marketing Organization is World Class.There is huge Financial pressures to deliver Quarterly Earnings Results which is consistent with a Publicly Traded CPG Company.  Senior Management is obsessed with cost cutting facilitated by broad workforce reductions.  Invariably, these Organizational Reductions come with promises of working simpler and more streamlined.  The Company is great at delivering cost reductions but has a very poor track record in alleviating what are at times unbearable workloads.  They have consistently reduced employee benefits cutting Pension, Health Benefits, Travel Expenses, downgraded salaries and have outsourced many positions overseas.  In the HQ Location in East Hanover, NJ, Sales, Marketing and Operations Management is top notch.  The Finance Leadership Team  are not very good at motivating their employees and collaborating with cross functional business partners. Finally, due to ongoing headcount reductions, there is very limited career opportunities for motivated professionals particularly in Finance, Marketing and Sales."
bad,The hours vary every day so its difficult if you have another job or plan on going to school. Long hours typically no breaks because you work to get finished with your day and once its over you head home. a lot of extra time wasted in travel.
bad,"Merchandising for Mondelez International is not difficult in and of itself. However, intense micro-management and a lack of communication made the job increasingly difficult. Co-workers are not held accountable for their actions and management was uncaring and unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was the amount of work expected of you in the limited time you were given. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers light up when you help them find something they'd desperately been looking for."
bad,"Typical day... travel from store to store working orders and building displays. Sounds easy enough.  Not really.  This company is mostly concerned about getting as much work out of you as they can , in as little time as possible. Everything you do is timed, you're tracked by your gps phone. Don't like back braking labor for up to 12 hrs a day? ? No need to apply. Low pay compared to other companies. ..never full time hours. High turnover for merchandisers because they don't pay enough to do all the stuff  they expect in the time they give."
bad,"Depending what territory you are at. You could start at 6 a.m. or Noon. Times varied due to locations and days of the week. Most of the time orders were late. Sales reps would know 50% time if order was on time or late. Merchandisers would walk into stores clueless on where endcaps, displays where located. Lack of communication between Sales reps and store mangers was always an issue. Merchandiser worked alone if trained well enough. Worked 10-12 hour shifts with no breaks. Would wrote orders for sales reps. Go help other Merchandisers even after an 8 hour shift. Work more than 6 days straight. Hardest part of the job was managing hours with a long list of store in 8 hours. That may have included endcap changes, building huge displays and working more than 3 stores a day with over a total of 300 cases order by yourself. Didn't get paid extra for writing orders for sales reps. No vacation time aloud and barely no personal time or having a life in general. Would work a 8-12 hour shift then do it again at 5-6 a.m. in the morning the next day. Rarely ever get weekends off. Scheduling is off the wall. Work 7 days and next week work 3 days. Never had a permanent schedule. Unless you were a Full Time.  Part time basically used for no more than 40 hours a week. Can't budget this job if it goes from 10 hours to 40+ hrs a week."
bad,"Ambiente dall'esposizione internazionale per brand globali, organizzazione fortemente incentrata sulle sales e sul punto di vendita, marketing gestito centralmente presso l'headquarter europeo. Processo decisionale un pò rallentato a causa di forti procedure interne. Nell'ultimo periodo, ambiente statico dovuto a pesanti ristrutturazioni interne"
bad,Coming to work for this company was a huge mistake.  There is no room for advancement.  The benefits are horrible.  There are people who have been working in this facility for 20+ years whom are not as qualified as I am and have horrible work ethics that make much more money than I do. There is absolutely no teamwork or advancement opportunities here.
bad,Pay is low for the hours worked but other than a ok place for a career.
bad,I worked for this company for 8 years. Nabisco was great!  Best job in the world. Mondelez took over in 2012. Nothing but abuse from the managers and the new Mondelez international. Poor treatment by customers they service .Be your own Doctor because their medical is like not having any at all. Threats daily and abusive slandering from managers. Management is terrible most of them have no business being in the positions there in. Co workers are scared and will rat each other out.  Filed a complaint which was over looked by HR. They are still holding my 401k hostage.  Pension and Bonus are a thing of the past. Don t believe the lies this company went from hero to zero and lawsuits are coming. I am Sooo glad to be gone.
bad,Company was Nabisco now Mondelez. Wouldn't find out work schedule until the day before. Was not guaranteed hours for the week. No benefits for part-time. Super easy job stocking shelves. Must have own car and get gas reimbursement. Lots of turnover.
bad,"For the amount of stress we're under on a day and night basis, Mondelez should focus more on their employees than their shareholders. "
bad,DSD business in U.S. seems to be a reactionary. We are no longer acting in a proactive manner.  It is unclear what our direction is.  I hate to be so negative about the company I have been with for over a decade but I have nothing positive to say.
bad,"Stocking shelves, building displays, working and maintaining a store’s back stock inventory."
bad,"Linha de produção, trabalho em equipe empresa com padroes para trabalhar agora!!!!"
bad,Hard to work with inexperienced management constant change 13 managers in 8 years pressure is put squarely on supervisor no knowledge of equipment spend lot of time in office
bad,"Mondelez is a good company to work for but Regional Management to Executive Management have no clue whats really going on in the field.  They live by what the computer tells them to do.  Management of the company is a joke as they want you to think they actually care about you as an individual.  All they care about is how much you cost the company.  "
bad,Es ambiental donde ahí compañerismo y apoyo mutuo dentro de la empresa
bad,It was a great company to work for like 8 years ago.. Now it’s a stressful plays to work all Management care about is the sales rep as a full timer you do a lot of extra work for the pay .. you write orders and lots of extra You’re like a Ginny pig .. I have had the worst experience this last year with a rep and it cost me a bad review with it cost my family money
bad,"Times changed over the years I spent working with the business.There were quite a few name changes and with each the work environment became worse. Cuts on employees, pay, and time off and the culture was very negative by the time I left. If I would have left a review more than 5 years ago, it would have been much higher. At this time they are  downsizing because they no longer have the production levels to run, eliminating positions, and offering severance for employees to leave earlier than retirement age. Communication continues to be a struggle within the company including between the plant leadership team."
bad,get in your car and drive to the store you are assigned to and start your. The worst part is the drivers are rarely on time. I left because I wasn't getting enough hours
bad,"Des machines vieillissantes donnant beaucoup d'arrêts "
bad,Supposed to be a growth company.  Company is cutting costs instead.  IT is heavily outsourced - technical expertise are no longer valued - instead they just want project managers.
bad,"You get your schedule for Sunday-Saturday on Friday night (2 days before).  But your actual schedule could change the night before.  For instance, if you were scheduled to work 1 store for 3 hours, the night before you might suddenly have 4 stores and be scheduled for 9 hours.  There is no warning.  Don't make plans, don't schedule appointments because you never know when this will happen.  Weekends are the busiest.  As a PT rep there are no benefits, which was to be expected.  What I was surprised about was that there are no discounts.  Rotation is a big part of the job, yet you will find that many reps do no rotate and you will find yourself being blamed even when you're doing your job, either because you go over your hours doing it or because you miss a few trying to stay within your given time.  It's nice that you can start when you're able but it's hard to stay within the times they give you.  Their time expectations getting from job to job are highly unreasonable."
bad,"SUMMARY"
bad,Depressing culture.  More and more jobs are being moved to low cost locations or outsourced.  Ten years of subpar salary increases with no chance for promotion.
bad,"Job is a challenge. You are left to do your work and plan out your day. Need to be able to prioritize time. Job is flexible to your life, but if you take time off they cut your hours."
bad,"Workforce reduction resulted in job loss for thousands of dedicated employees like myself. Nearly 2 decades later, I had to start over. That's unacceptable."
bad,"It started out as a great place to work with a great schedule but it has turned into a demoralizing place to work at with upper management that only cares about how the place runs according to their paperwork.  If they actually cared about their employees, we wouldn't be worried about the whole place relocating to Mexico."
bad,"j'ai appris beaucoup de chose technique dans cette entreprise."
bad,Mondelez was a great company to work for. They have great benefits and pride themselves in being competitive in the market place.
bad,"good place to work, with a lot of travel."
bad,"pra começar eles seguraram a minha carteira e so depois de 2 meses me chamaram depois de muita briga ja começou assim depois era ara eu trabalha em um setor,me mandaram para outro que não era nada comparativo com a minha, deficiência reclamei um monte nao adiantou nada aqui te tive que passar por cirurgia de ernia  eu falei chorei no RH não adiantou nada eu abandonei o serviço eu pedi pra manda embora ele não mandaram eu pedi as conta não deram falei para me muda de função não mudaram eu abandonei o serviço depois de 3 meses me ligaram para eu ir fazer o acerto..."
bad,"Sayın yetkili:"
bad,"Though I have only been here for a few months, I was not happy with the pay periods. Part-time has it's perks but when you have to call(beg) to work because there aren't enough hours for both Full and Part time merchandisers it's hard to survive off of the bi weekly income. Like most folks said, once you are in the door, ALL managers will not even recognize you..unless you are a sales representative. I will say that the group you become a part of are great coworkers. Anyone outside that are veeery peculiar sometimes. Overall, not a bad job. Recommend that this will only be a SECONDARY JOB."
bad,If you want to advance stay away from SDE roles. Loads of promisses from senior management with regards to further advancement and development - but in reality they milk you out and force to leave.
bad,"fixed term contract so no job security, and there is a lot of uncertainty there with a lot of jobs moving abroad."
bad,"Get ready to work 12 to 16 hr shifts rarely you get to work only         8 hrs, always being forced to stay, people with high seniority always calling off , getting laid off constantly ,but amazing pay and benefits."
bad,"Too high of objectives on a regular basis.     "
bad,"The workplace is typically whatever store you are in, pretty much work at your own pace. Management is okay. Honestly there isn't really a hard part of the job."
bad,This position has very little chance for promotion. It is also very age sensitive. If you are a sales rep over 30 you likely will never get promoted. A lot of labor intensive work for a little money. Vacation planning must be done a full year in advance! horrible.
bad,"Great tools and capabilities, strong analytical culture"
bad,"You will be physically merchandising, writing orders, covering sales reps vacations. Not an ideal job if you want to have a personal life because of traveling to a different area each week (or sometimes each day) and not knowing until the last minute."
bad,Job security has become scarce. The work environment is open and the employees makes the job fun and get the job done. WAS a worthy place to look forward to retiring from. Management makes the work schedule very unpleasing. Totally not flexible with inconsistent hours on a weekly basis.
bad,"A typical day consists of visiting stores, selling to managers, managing merchandisers, and ensuring that our business operates fluently. I learned resilience, how to empower and trust others, motivational techniques, coaching techniques, and the importance of flawless execution of management's plan. The management here pretty much make the decisions and put a plan in place to help the organization execute. There is a high level of communication between management and the sales reps. There is not much contact with my co-workers since we do not report to any specific location; we only meet once a month as a team. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult store managers and satisfying their needs; in conjuction with achieving an ever-growing sales objective. The most enjoyable part of the job is being out in the field and meeting new people and establishing great relationships with store personnel and managers."
bad,"Good company for the most part if you are already in the position you want.  Upper management is very shady and deceitful.  I was doing a fantastic job and improving every branch that I was put in charge of.  Mondelez kept me at a level just under receiving any help with moving costs and knew of my 5 year plan.  Even though upper management was planning to eliminate the position I was working towards, they continued to string me along because I was improving every troubled branch they sent me to.  Unfortunately I had to pay for multiple moves and disrupt my family greatly without knowing that the position I was doing it all for was going to be eliminated."
bad,"The company is evolving as the consumer packed foods industry is going through a lot of change, The company was looking to make major changes to how it wen to market as well as what it's workforce looks like"
bad,"It was a good first expierence for a job. But definitely not going back. The people were judgmental and hardheaded. The work was interesting, but not where I want to be."
bad,"A typical day you would check your notes and see what needs done. Talk to the grocery manager and confirm any changes and throw your load and drive to the next store. The hardest part of this job is communication they're horrible at letting you know what needs done and they also change your schedule alot without confirming it with you which makes it hard to balance life. Also, this job puts alot of wear and tear/ miles on your vehicle and its totally not worth it. The most i enjoy about this job is you work alone for the most part but overall avoid this company."
bad,"I loved working for this company, as soon as I started looking to move into the back office jobs (HR, logistics, recruiter). I realised its EXTREMELY hard to get out of the sales aspect of the company."
bad,"Not a good company to work for the managers weren’t appreciated of someone’s hard work , only positive feedback when as a whole accomplished something good"
bad,"The amount of work you do doesnt equal up to the pay that you are given. The time spent in stores,  building displays, or even writing orders should be more pay like some of these other companies that's paying $17.00hr or more."
bad,"A lot of backstock in almost all the stores I go to. Almost all the stores I work at have very disorganized back rooms due to other merchandisers not caring and just throwing stuff in the back. Not the kind of job for a lot of hours, many times getting 7 plus hour days and then the rest of the week getting even less than 3."
bad,"You go to a set of grocery store locations based on what your GPS phone and sales rep for the territory tell you. You work loads or backstock and set up displays at each location. This can take anywhere from 40 min to 5 hours per location, and the amount of locations vary from 2 to 5. I barely got to know any of my coworkers because I wouldn't see most of them for weeks at a time. In this state, at least, the company is struggling a bit, and everyone is stretched thin. If you're willing to put up with a lot of hours with very little training, there's a lot of money to be made."
bad,"Metodo de gestao maquiado pelos lideres, operadores e tecnicos sao pressionados a se enquadrar ao sistema de gestão com ameaças"
bad,At least in the region I worked in They will tell you anything to your face to keep you placated and working 50 plus hours a week.  Please don't expect any appreciation from management.
bad,hours werent bad  pay was not much  i only got offered a promotion when i told them i was leaving have to use own vehicle  sometimes had to wait around for delivery
bad,The merchandising job is very taxing on your body. Having to use your own vehicle to travel to the stores with limited mileage reimbursement was a disappointment.
bad,wrok was early and hard...co workers did not help and customers were everywhere all the time...money was ok...but there are no benefits...
bad,Kraft was a great company for many years.  MDLZ has very ambitious targets.  We hope the new CEO will bring back a winning attitude to Mondelez International.
good,have to wait over a year to get full time so have had no benefits for over a year with the promise of full time and never got it but your independent so you are your own supervisor
good,"They only hire part time no benifits no paid time off, no paid sick leave , no vacation. The hours get cut so bad during the summer you cant survive.ok job for someone who only wants 15 to 20 hrs a week."
good,"Promotion was based, not on performance but upon managements' personal preferences. Although built upon a sales organizations priorities, exceeding projected sales was not always positive."
good,Aprendi muito na àrea de vendas e aprendi muito mais a me relacionar com pessoas melhorando o meu relacionamento social e praticando o relacionamento interpessoal.
good,era ruim pois eu nunca tinha hora pra sair dai não tinha como eu começar um curso que eu sempre quis.
good,Wouldn't really recommend as a career. Its low paid and long hours on your feet.  Mostly manual labor and lifting boxes.  A pro for this job was how flexible it was whilst I was in college.
good,"Only part-time work offered to me, unable to advance in the company, union unsatisfactory. No benefits, hard work in dept. no opportunity to advance to bakery."
good,"A typical day was very busy moving around all over the store stocking the shelves and building displays. Was treated poorly by management, always yelled at in the store, in front of customers,  I learned the job, how to rotate products on the shelf and I leanred to build displays. the hardest part of the job was working with a boss that was rude to you and mistreated you in front of all the customers. most enjoyable part was driving between stores and having time to your self"
good,Company is more worried about appeasing stockholders than caring about there employees or customers!!!! They like to higher people with no experience because you can train them the bad ways and they don't know any better.  Any one with experience won't tolerate the BS long.
good,Go in and be prepared to pack out product you are responsible for running through the backstock and keeping the backstock organized.  Also responsible for setting and building displays
good,"Most people are working on contract. No growth, perks or incentives. At times you may be required to work overtime but won't be paid for it. No job security."
good,"the change of management at the plant make job tougher. it have a good career growth, but be fully ready for giving all your comitment to the plant as the plant has a lot to grow"
good,"Long hours"
good,It was ok long hours over night. Lots of Standing. Management drags feet on advancement expects you to do work of people that are already hired in to the company but not willing to hire you into the company.
good,Mondelez is a great company to work for and a lot of experience will be gained from being at cooperate or manufacturing position. The Atlanta location is not an accurate representation of the company.
good,"The local management tries to be friendly. Putting away Nabisco product is actually enjoyable."
good,intérimaires pris pour des imbéciles on nous appel pour un jour et plus rien
good,"There are so many uncontrollable factors with this job simply due to the fact that it is in logistics and food delivery. There are very few things that you as the employee have control over. Some examples of those are delivery times... sometimes the truck will be 1, 2, or 3+ hours late. If that's your last store - you are expected to stay. My first week on the job, I pulled a 14 hour day. My manager didn't bat an eye and said that during the busy season that is expected. If deliveries were at 4:00 in the morning and you know you have a long day - you need to be at the store at 4:30am. Schedule is flexible...but out of your control."
good,I was not told what hours I was working until the day before I had to be somewhere.  It was impossible to keep this job and have a child in daycare.  The Sales guy did not take work seriously.  It was a very hard company to work for and the pay was not worth it.
good,"Me encargaba de la visibilidad de productos de la marca. Siempre poniendo todo en orden, recepción de mercadería, rotación de productos, marketing y visibilidad."
good,"Great products, easy to sell but really bad managers, they don't care about the employee specially here in Austin, they don't work with the partner... always busy doing nothing, long long long hours, but overall its a great company just need to changes several managers."
good,"A typical day at work is going into big box retailers and grocery stores, doing deliveries, re-stocking, displays, etc.  Since Mondelez took over after they split, has not been that favorable.  Part time employees are treated like they do not matter, the hours are often cut without warning. We do not get bonuses like the full time merchandisers too.  You can be the best part time merchandiser with the best reviews from the company and stores and not move up the ladder.  It is a sad reality.  The raises are minimal at best. And the corporate culture needs to be overhauled.  "
good,"the entire business plan is set up for failure. We are in a declining market, almost none existent. Trying to get blood from a stone. Expectation from out customers are too high"
good,"If you want a dead in job thats flexible ,no advancement, stressful, somewhat easy this is the job for you. Raises range from .22 to .28 cents a year. You do get 7 holidays, 5 sick days, 2 weeks vacation . The last line is the best thing about the company."
good,Long hours and never enough help to get the job done. One of those company on which you are just a another number. The hardest part of the job is the long hours
good,"I consider myself one of the lucky ones because my sales rep is the most sensible person in a position of authority I've met in a very long time. If it wasn't for him, the job would be much more stressful. As with most retail jobs, the job itself is ridiculously easy, but the people in charge are idiots. They don't think it's possible to exist without playing politics. We get a new manager every couple years or so, and they always start out attacking employees over dumb stuff in an attempt to make themselves look good. The job is literally stocking cookies and crackers on store shelves. Yet they treat people like criminals for simply doing their jobs- they constantly watch people and then make false accusations without asking any questions, usually through a nasty, sarcastic email or an unexpected store visit. I like the freedom of not having direct management while I'm working, but it's extremely difficult to become a full time employee here. If you do become full time, they load extra work onto you, yet at the same time riding you about overtime."
good,"Cuando era adams era excelente, al cambiar de razon social se fue perdiendo el beneficio al empleado, baja de comisiones"
good,"Fast pace working environment subject to changes through day. Can be assigned work assignment but may have to go somewhere else or pick up extra work assignments during day. If you work under a good sales rep there is good communication on how to execute plans, displays, etc."
good,Not sure about other facilities. The one in fairlawn had Penn state grads which they catered. If you had an engineering degree you were gold even if you never contributed. HR will hire folks from their former jobs and will not promote within. You can try to come up with projects or ideas but the BUM's don't want to hear it unless it comes from them. If your good at what you do they don't want to move or promote because the line supervisors are vital and the BUM's don't want to answer why the lines fail. I really wish that corporate would see the BS that folks with share with them and call them out.  That facility would run much better with the talent they had then bringing in good ol boys and girls.
good,"8 hour shift, usually 6 but often 7 days a week. when you get forced in on the weekend more often than not you have no work assigned. if they have no work, then why force people to work? You have no time for family and friends."
good,"every day is 2 or 3 hrs and sometimes one 2 or 3 days a week, no continuity at all, Management does not provide training or feed back, work load  not evenly shared,sales managers only care about making their budgets. the most enjoyable part is getting to interact with customers on a daily basis."
good,the organization as a whole is okay. there is alot of stress and trickery to the organization driven by management and corporate offices. There is no set schedules.
good,was good at start but as it change just not there as to making it fell good  . the product was not there when needed and things that did not sell forced out
good,"Job had potential to be awesome. Company always trying to reinvent the wheel, if it aint broke don't fix it. Great pay but would hold you hostage telling you you can't go home until they say so. They didn't want workers opinions. They would have you work your day off to make up any holiday that came up. Would never close no matter how much snow was forecast."
good,Turnover muito alto e gestão do departamento pessoal com oportunidade de melhoria. Mas no geral é uma empresa boa de trabalhar
good,"Company is good but i don't like the management."
good,I have enjoyed my time with the company. Most sales reps are good people to work for
good,"Swab test sites"
good,"Trabalho rotineiro de reposição de produtos de consumo, limpeza e precificação montagem de trabalho de Merchandising."
good,"your day starts off as you finding out what station you are going to be at and you stay there til your shift is over. At this company you learn about how to work diiferent machices and about the food products you are repacking. The people are great, but in this department we dont get benefits or get paid that much and we do more then the bakery side or about the same.They are working on getting our department these things but overall its a okay company and you can learn a lot if you stay focus."
good,"Gestores arrogantes, que nem ao menos cumprimentam a equipe ( gerencia de transportes)"
good,I wouldn't recommend this as a career.  Low pay for a physically demanding job. You can think you did a good job but a store manager would say otherwise.
good,Mondelez is not for the faint of heart. Be prepared to work. A good chunk of your time will be spent cleaning up after co-workers. Pay is good for what the work is.
good,Don’t think your opinions will matter. Safety first until production is compromised. Somehow confidentiality always gets compromised.  The blow good smoke but when it comes down to it the grass is greener on the other side.  The Pay is the only thing keeping people there . Everyday team leaders would tell you the company isn’t going good when they would have there meetings. No security at all.
good,Sell and merchandise products to large grocer retailers.  The higher volume stores a merchandiser was assigned.  Given a specific demographic sales area. Got tired of management calling daily to advise $$ amount that needed to be written that day to make goals
good,"Was pretty typical of production/factory job keep the machine running and stay busy, while keeping track of your numbers, and keeping your work area clean. The downside was poor management job compartimentalizing (each worker was doing the job of 3 workers) and when i left they were trying to add more job responsibilities and paperwork to the the position."
good,"There was a lot of miscommunication, which was partly my fault. Starting out there is a lot of grunt work. The people are mostly nice, most jobs you have only have one or two bosses, but as you will quickly realize the stores that you service have bosses and receivers (people who manage what comes in and where it goes) and they tell you how to set up and etc. so basically depending on how many store you work at thats how many bosses you really have until you move up. "
good,"Trabajo en equipo  "
good,not the best with paying for your milage and car use. its an okay job but the lowest paying vendor I think there is. I would look into other jobs but an okay job if you need one.
good,"Dias de trabalhos exaustivos por estar atuando como Jovem Aprendiz, líder pede favor em partes difíceis que não conheço. Porém, aprendi bastante coisas interessantes e que contribuem para minha realização profissional."
good,"I loved my former position, but was forced into a position I didn't want to have. The work and benifits are a great plus in this job, but it's all the pressure and demands that make it very stressful"
good,"If you like a job working five days a week at first... this is it. If you like being in a job that calls you in on your days off, than this is for you. If you like working from 6 am to 9 pm covering your shift and others, than this is for you. "
good,"Sales Reps and merchandisers are overworked. Expectations are out of line. Need to hire competent people but pay will not draw them to this company,"
good,"Es una empresa en constante cambio, mucha desorganización, un buen lugar para aprender."
good,"Nabisco is an fast paced environment in which we build large quantities of pallets overnight to meet quotas. i have learned team building exercises, management works with workers to achieve goals, co-workers all work together to create a safe work environment and complete quotas set by company,the hardest part of the job is keeping an fast pace to meet the line quotas, the most enjoyable part of the job is the team comrodary."
good,"Trabalha por três"
good,"I love working here, however we are often promised to have first dibs on Full-time placement, of which is most often given to outsiders first."
good,"There are a lot of things that needs to be fixed about this company, but it is still a good place to work"
good,"Uma empresa com a porcentagem média para se trabalhar, foi produtiva, aprendi a lidar com pagamento (emissões) a lidar com o publico, e cuidar de varias localidades do Brasil sozinha, porém o que me deixo desacreditada foi a falta de opurtunidades para crescer, por isso procuro uma vaga em uma empresa a onde posso, mostrar capacidades e ser motivada a cada vez mas."
good,Little management direction and seemed to change direction monthly. Management more worried about paperwork than doing the job set forth . conference calls were continual
good,"Good Company with many benefits for full time employees, Part time employees don't get those benefits and they really should. Most of the time there is to must product ordered and no shelve space, there is a lot of back stock and most store managers have issues with that for many reasons including money tied up in inventory they don't need, product going past best used by date."
good,Ambiente de trabajo es bueno pero no hay oportunidad de crecimiento
good,"You are schedule to work 42 hours a week,  but the reality is a 50 or 55 hour week job. "
good,Your life is non existent with this company.  Management is constantly talking numbers  but wants you to be safe. Poor communication between the supervisors doesn't help either
good,Empresa mto boa mas oportunidade de crescimento é quase nula.
good,"Quazi-managed chaos is the best description. In 3 years, 4 plant managers, 2 direct managers, 70% supervisor turnover, and constant re-prioritization."
good,le travail est interessant bien payé pour ce que l'on fait mais une trés mauvaise gestion du personnel et du planning
good,"Fazendo funções de outros operadores , onde não poderia fazer."
good,"Very steam line and everything put on supervisor plate, will be forced to cover different departments and various shifts. Limited ability for promotion, basically have to wait for someone to quit, retire, or get fired for a opportunity."
good,se manejan con mucha precion laboral para cumplimiento de objetivos sin contar con el tiempo que le dedicas para los objetivos que es demasiado sin tener una calidad de vida equilibrada.
good,Enjoyed working in and with different stores. Our DM hardly ever worked with us and did not know the challenges we faced and how many we overcame because of hard work.
good,"No Advancement opportunities. If you are qualified and you apply for a position, You probably won't even get a interview.You have to be a order writer, then relief, before you can get into sales. I have 31 years of sales experience,have applied for 7 order writing positions and I can't even get a interview."
good,Initially I loved my job but the last few years there was constant management change and work / life balance in my department was awful. Management didn't seem to want to listen to the employees doing the work. Or maybe they just didn't care.
good,You will stock shelves at many different locations and towns and work with many different people.  The hardest part of the job is getting questions from customers in the store about other products you know nothing about.  The customers are not aware you work for a vendor and not the store.
good,"I loved my job at Nabisco because of the area manager I had, was going through some health issues and did not have coverage yet. SO much hope only to be let down by the unproffessionalism of senior management."
good,"I enjoy job due to the fast pace. Been doing the job for three years. However mgmt. is not always in tuned with their employees. There is NO set schedule for any merchandiser. There is NO guarantee how many hours a week one will work. You can work 20 hrs. one week and as little as 5 hrs. the following week .And then a week with no work at all. The schedules come out the day before except for the weekends. Which makes it difficult to plan anything including other job schedules.  If you have no other job and are willing to work whenever the opportunity arises, then this is a job for you!  If looking for dependability, well keep looking."
good,"O dia de trabalho era muito desconfortável pois era muito produto jogado fora, aprendi à dar muita atenção aos custos e desperdícios tentando controla-los."
good,"you can make a lot of money at this company, but the job work/life balance is not there, you are forced to work around the clock, its hard job to keep if you dont live in the area"
good,"Mondelez states you can advance in your career, but you honestly cannot. The job drains you mentally and physically. The management are nice and friendly, however, merchandisers put in the most work. The workplace is nice because you are going into different stores to put up product. Everyday is a new challenge which I absolutely loved."
good,"Pros"
good,"A physical posistion as a Merchandiser. Sales Rep/Manager should be your goal. "
good,Work load to heavy for time allotted from Organization.Nabisco expects 55 hours of work to be done in 42 hours. Management is not consistent on company policies.
good,"Es una empresa reconocida a nivel mundial que desarrolla a su equipo de trabajo de manera profesional y personal, que te impulsa a buscar y alcanzar objetivos aplicables a tu área de trabajo. "
good,"Pay is good. Management is horrible. Hard work & dedication means nothing with this company, its all about who you know!"
good,"Una buena opcion de crecimiento profesional, buen amabiente laboral                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ."
good,"development, productive fun work place"
good,"the work is acceptable, some excellent friendly people to work with, some poor management but ok place to work, job security dwindling."
good,"Set up team meetings set team expectations and goals"
good,High paced and big work load.  Internal issues with production and new item introductions.
good,"Jag har haft chansen att var på olika avdelningar och det har ju medfört en del nya kompetenser. "
good,Eu acredito que eles estão implementado errado o sistema integrado devido a cobrança psicológica que eles fazem.
good,I was working 8-12 hours a day including driving time. I hadn't realized what I was getting myself into when I accepted the position. Spent a lot of time on my own stocking shelves.
good,"Typical day at work"
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo, te capacitan en muchas cosas y el trabajo en general es fácil."
good,"As an intern I was told I wouldnt have to work weekends, yet I did. Sometimes the trucks were late (most times they were late), so I would be sitting around waiting for the trucks which would cause my days to go much longer than they should. There was no set schedule so you never really knew what you'd be doing next."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo compañerismo oportunidad de progresar"
good,entreprise où la vie personnelle est mise de côté.
good,"Máxima limpieza, seguimiento de requerimientos y cumplimientos en proceso"
good,I hated my time working for Mondelez. I had a family emergency and called my supervisor to tell her I had to leave and she threw a huge fit and acted like it was a huge deal when she would leave to get her kids all the time. I even offered to go back to the store and finish the rest of the freight that needed to be thrown.
good,"good Place, bad wage.....shift is must bad part because you work like continental shift."
good,work is different daily depending on the period close. business is determined by the Ad activities in each account.More support is needed to be highly successful with the organization
good,La nueva nave hizo a la empresa una mega empresa pero con personal de hace 20 años que no estan acostumbrados a mega fabricas y estan muy cerrados al cambio y nuevas formas de trabajar de manera mas eficiente
good,"Company is in the process of eliminateing this position by the end of this year or next year. They will fool you that they are not, but they are. All the store managers at Walmart, Kroger and Publix will tell you in so many words. Stores are going to automatic replenishment,"
good,"If your a person that needs stability, this is not for you.They are flexible Not much room for growth, especially in CA.Nice going store to store to display product. Co-workers pretty cool."
good,"Depending on the market, you could have a pretty consistent job or be tossed all over the place. Some sales reps were great to work for, while others made the job more difficult."
good,didn't provide what I was looking for in a employer. micromanagement isn't my thing and the company wouldn't stand up to the union. So I decided to move on.
good,"I enjoyed working by myself and working at the various grocery chains,  Management was inconsistent in the hours given. Manager and supervisor lacked communication with each other."
good,"On the job at 6:00 AM or before. I go in and add product to shelves and displays. I rotate product so as not to have outdated products on selling shelves. The management says one thing and does another."
good,"Dobrá zkušenost dělat na pozici Spidera, nebo-li asistenta vedoucího linky. Naučil jsem se dělat v obrovském systému SAP. Schopnost kontrolovat a komunikovat s podřízenými. Zadávat úkoly a dbát na průběch splnění. Člověk musel dělat několik věcí najednou a být na více místech. Pozice není vhodná pro každého, ale mě se to líbílo, dokud vedení neudělalo změnu. Zábavná část byla, když jsem navhroval možností řešení lepších podmínek pro zaměstnance. Vymýšlení zlepšovacích programů a různých systémů pro kvalitnější práci."
good,"operadores sem noção de trabalho em equipe,coordenadores e supervisores totalmente sem diálogo,ninguém sabe o porque disso e o porque daquele outro,da´licença.depois diz que é formado."
good,"Arrive at your assigned location. Put product out in designated location per store planogram. Keep area clean and clear of clutter."
good,"Started as a merchandiser "
good,"I was an employee for 40 and a half years, driver. When we had good management, the place ran like a well oiled machine, but the past decade has produced very poor management. Lack of people skills creates the lowest moral going. There was a time when a manager would ask almost the impossible, and we would deliver, and just about dare them to even try and bury us in work. We all stepped up. Now, I'm glad I'm out. Left before I was 62 because of the very poor management. Would still be there. I was union, but was known as MR. NABISCO.All company, but would have been fired had i stayed.The thought that ""those that work, will"" and the slackers get a free ride, doesn't sit well with dedicated employee. I do not see a great future for this company, but it once was a Great place to work, and a great company. Bring back the old biscuit, they were better times, and money was made, and employees mattered!"
good,"A typical day at work is putting out fires caused by a culture afraid of change. I learned that most people want to just go with the flow. Management wasn't consistent in enforcement of change and discipline. Most of my co-workers wanted to do a good job, but didn't feel they had proper support. The hardest part of the job was getting the support need to make change. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning the process."
good,"I worked in manufacturing for Mondelez and it is a 24/7 process. Lots of weekend overtime, but long hours everyday - and work doesn't really stop at the end of the day. The hourly employees are in a very strong union which makes new projects difficult to implement."
good,"upon my departure - which was mostly on good terms - the company seemed to be heading more and more toward becoming a hostile work environment. when speaking with former colleagues, it sounds as though I left just in time. this is simply hearsay though."
good,"Fast paced at times, must have great social skills and work ethics, experience in sales isn't a must but you will learn a lot from this job if you take it seriously as you should. Co-workers like family! part-time work, and hours vary on a regular basis. Great starter job! You get out of this job what you put into it."
good,The hardest part of the job is getting used to switching between days and nights. Sometimes you barely get any sleep because you're not used to sleeping during the day. Then your days off you have to completely switch your sleep schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to have every other weekend off.
good,malgré le travail qui a été réalisé il reste beaucoup à faire
good,"A empresa vem sofrendo reestruturações quase que anuais a 4 anos, a rotatividade é muito alta e por isso não existe uma cultura organizacional. Não existe incentivo a educação, como participação no pagamento de MBA's, gestores sem treinamento e RH desorganizado. Por outro lado as marcas são muito bacanas!"
good,the company is good to work for if you are looking for part time. the company is very laid back. its fun because you get to meet other people. i have learned how much a merchandiser has to do. one thing about it you dont have any coworkers with you as you are alone in the field.
good,"Mein typischer Tag auf dieser Position hat um 7:30 Uhr begonnen, wann ich ins Büro gemeinglich gekommen bin. Ich habe meine persönlichen Emails übergeschaut und von 8:00 Uhr bis 17:00 Uhr musste ich die Anrufe und Emails von den Lieferanten antworten und die Probleme mit ihren Rechnungen lösen. "
good,"a lot of expectation for the jobs pay. very micro managed, position not explained thoroughly before,  training was minimal for thee expectataions"
good,"Foco nas pessoas"
good,The workplace is start up shared services with young and experience employee.
good,"Get in line for the rollercoaster of a lifetime. Looking for for extra hours..no worries here, we plan on working you like a dog anyway, what’s another 12-14 hour day. Family?!! Overrated! Did I say a dog hahaha, we meant a rented mule. Lies and sugar coating galore. Hello new hire, yes we’ll recruit as driver, As always we’re a equal opportunity destroyer."
good,"Good consistent job early morning hours "
good,"never a dull moment"
good,"Trabalhei na pascoa,exploram muito,prometem efetivaçao e chega na hora tudo mentira!"
good,Mondelez is a good place to start a career. It’s also a good place to work without a college education because if you work hard and can handled merchandising/selling you can move up without a degree. Have to enjoy the grind of driving and hard work.
good,The hours your work was never enough to get everything done that you needed to get done. They expected way to much from one person. When I worked with the company we burnt out so many employes because of the workloads.
good,"plenty of work, high demands, expectations do not match labor afforded in all encountered field positions.  Sales goals sometimes pie in the sky numbers in some territories. "
good,"Monitorar ações da empresa e concorrentes"
good,fast paced and learn a lot to take onto next job.  There are opportunities to move forward within the company but I believe taking the knowledge and moving on to next oppurtunity
good,"Empresa con muy buen crecimiento"
good,"I clearly remember from my time in MDLZ the sales targets being unrealistically high. Frequently bring in excess product to hit numbers only to return it later as out of date. Like many companies, who you know determines if you will move up."
good,"Mondelez is VERY bottom line focused, and that has deteriorated the culture.  The people are great, but the pressure to deliver bottom line with decreased resources is a big issue.  There is high turnover, and I can understand why."
good,"Mondelez good place to work; benefits/perks, career advancement/development, and culture all depend on your willingness to learn and adapt to change, your location, manager, and team/project."
good,"Typical day at work involves doing what your told to do and then you are left alone and you go do it. You learn no new skills and no one manages you. Culture wise everyone is nice and friendly with the exception of some people here and there, but those kind of people exist everywhere world wide. The hardest part of the job and most likely every job is the unwillingness of a company to spend money."
good,"I worked there for several years.  It was impossible to promoted despite my continued education, work ethic and manager awards.  There was no accountability for those that didn't do their jobs.  Very physical and demanding work.  Could be fun if you had the right attitude.  Management was never satisfied, but couldn't do the job themselves."
good,"I worked the morning shift, under a management that was extremely disorganized. Job was good but could have been much better. My supervisor made stores not like us coming in to work because he would argue and was rude to store management."
good,"Estive por poucos dias para uma ação de Páscoa. Não estive na empresa, trabalhei dentro de um supermercado. A única reclamação que faço é que uma empresa tão grande e não ganhamos nem 1 bombom após o término da ação."
good,Fun workplace with long working hours to be above production level. Fair benefits are in place for employees. Few completions are done within a year to keep employees educated about what is happening with the company and to keep employees involved in someway to the day to day production.
good,The bigest issue i have with this company is that its not consistent... you'll work one day and your not working for 4 days then they call you at 7am asking you to come in one day and then they send you a text massage at night saying no work again so... and so on
good,typical work day is basically working the load from delivery and the backstock too. Hardest part of my job is probably inconsistent hours a week. Most enjoyable is that I met a lot of great people.
good,Environment is changing and is a stressful environment with cost cutting. Work life balance is diminishing. The organization is lean and there are too many responsibilities for the number of employees in NA.
good,"The company was great in Green bay, WI, Janesville, WI, and St. Louis, MO. Although, the Detroit area is a terrible chapter to work for. Terrible management and coworkers in this region. Would recommend to people; just no tin this area."
good,"Management was very unorganized. Coming from a team in Michigan....Alabama team was a joke! Way too much merchandising for Sales Reps that should be selling and building customer relations. Objective in Michigan was 300,000 monthly. But... we got help when needed. Alabama team my objective was a 200,000 and I was throwing over 1000 cases weekly."
good,"Work use to be fun and enjoyable. Now they have to so many software issues. They are not user friendly and are constantly changing. The help desk has been outsourced and we can't get the proper help we need in a timely fashion. the company makes us put together ""Great Place to Work:"" events to promote morale because they know its lacking."
good,"After Mondelez bought the company from Nabisco. After Mondelez took over the company stop caring about the employees. When I first started with Nabisco it was a great place to work. Everyone would help each other out. The managers would come out and see how you were doing. If you had any trouble with any stores with management, would show different ways how to build a display. the hardest part of the jobs was climbing all those ladders to put overstock away, when your short on one side. The enjoyable part you had no boss looking over your shoulder, plus you could get in some of the stores early to work on back stock or the order."
good,"Very good company to be with.."
good,"J'ai bien aimé travaillé  dans cette usine , si sa n'étais pas de la "
good,"Bonne expérience professionnelle et plusieurs postes pourvus au sein d'une même société qui a changé de raison sociale (LU FRANCE acheté par KRAFT FOODS, et KRAFT FOODS devenu MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL)."
good,Still trying to find balance between Company expectations and Union workers demands. High turnover still looking for the right group of upper Bakery management to take the needs of the Bakery over their own personal goals.
good,Was good till they decided to close plant. Also I don't understand what business it is of Indeed.com what i thought of my past or current employer. Does this help?
good,lots of walking and reparative lifting more than a 12hr shift lots overtime management could be better you use a voice pick with a head set you take turns throwing or building pallets and loading them into 18 wheeler
good,"Nabisco is a good company. The workloads can get to be a little bit excessive and it is hard to get promotions and advancement. Most days will turn into very long and stressful days. Compensation is great overall; however, once you factor in all the hours spent working, it could be better."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of 12 hour shifts."
good,As with any large corporation there isn't any room for advancement if you do not have a 4 year college degree AND agree to re-locating.  This company is under going many changes especially within the DSD business.  Making many lay-offs and management changes.
good,"The flexibility to adjust your schedule is great, but this job and company require a lot of self-motivation as you are not in a team setting. Relocation is a necessity in order to advance within the company. It can be tough for many to work in isolation as some days are very long, 12+, and other days will be very short, >2."
good,"Friendly from the most packaging employee, but there are too many political game. Machine operators are mostly from one nation, they try to kick out all other minority, maintenance are from another nation and they kick out all other minority too. As a dual licensed mechanic, technically can handle everything about machine but hate this situation, you will be blamed if anything happen, any breakdown will put on you head even happened on next shift, the majority people will say you didn't fix it, or you were playing on it so that they have breakdown, and you have to work tripple times than senior maintenance otherwise you will be kicked out."
good,"The work  assignment are given, such as what line to work , what  job you are to perform at that line.  And how long to work there before going to another position on that line."
good,"Agradecido siempre de Nabisco, que me dio la oportunidad de iniciar mi carrera profesional, una gran escuela con profesionales del mas alto nivel."
good,"The department that i was in was very productive and well organized, had fun working with my colleagues and my managers."
good,Really demanding job. If you have a team of bad merchandisers then things could go wrong for you. If you have Grerat merchandisers things would be perfect.
good,"The company has amazing brands, but the constant change makes the company unstable. Communication is unclear and varies region to region."
good,"Compared to other vendors, this company is easy peasy. I love the fact that we get free cookies and cracker after team meetings. I also love the weekend getaways that the company pays for.  I would go back if they paid for MBA."
good,"work long and head"
good,"llego al punto de venta lo frenteo luego pido el favor de bajar la mercancia surto hago rotacion de fechas"
good,"Planning of your day by prioritizing tasks, attending meetings, housekeeping functions on SAP system. Warehouse walkabout."
good,Good structure but weak individuals. Need more effort from top management to ensure company realizes its potential. There are too many cooks that ruin the final recipe.
good,"um dia tipico de trabalho na mondelez,ja havia conjestionamento nos cartões pontos,q ficavam num corredor,antes de começar a rodar a linha havia reunião de sala verde,q quase sempre o lider não estava presente,as vezes não podia mt contar com alguns colegas de trabalho la,mts faltavam,ou faziam corpo móle,as vezes o líder queria q resolvessemos coisas q só ele poderia resolver,ficava mais perdido q a gente na linha,e também mts equipamentos com problemas,mt antigos e sem inspeção das peças da mesma q precisavam ser trocadas,q as vezes quebravam por falta de inspeção,pra ver se a peça tava boa,com isso a maquina ficava as vezes o turno todo parada,e perdia mt produção,com isso quem escutava era nós,sem falar q as vezes nem tinha peça no estoque pra trocar."
good,empresa muito boa de se trabalhar com otimos beneficios lugar dinamico agradavel otima estrutura
good,"Good work culture but lacks in proper system."
good,es una empresa muy grande con una variedad de galletas y con mucho marketing empresarial respentando al empleado como la ley manda con seguro salario y las comodidades
good,Boa empresa. Um ótimo ambiente de trabalho e pessoas qualificadas. Oportunidade de crescimento e benefícios.
good,"The company used to be a fantastic place to work, but has been on a steady decline since the company split into KFG and MDLZ. Turnover is high, morale is low, and people are lost in the shuffle. There seems to be as many contractors roaming the floors as there are full time employees, and the knowledge transfer has been horrible with transitions of employees. "
good,I learned a lot working for Mondelez.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working in many different locations but this was also the hardest part of the job.
good,"Hardest part of job is to connect to virtual teams, to understand the time zone of virtual teams and culture difference"
good,"each day i would go to local stores and merchandise kraft food products for those stores...my immediate boss was fantastic and we worked great together...there really was not a hard part to my job...i really enjoyed each and every aspect of the job,"
good,"For a part time job its not too bad. $11 an hour but no more then 24 hours a week, so don't expect too much. I even think they stopped giving the 3rd day every other week, so thats 16 hours one week, and 24 the next. Some of the management is great, the rest is not that great... Great job security, its very hard to even get fired from the place or anything along those lines, however, if you are looking to move up from this position, look again, there are 0 advancement opportunities. but yeah, 16-24 hours a week, 8 hour shifts, and really not hard work, its a good part time job."
good,"Foi otimo trabalhar na empresa ate o momento em que fiquei com tendinite no onbro .por esforco repetitivo..foi feito cirurgia apos a volta ao trabalho tudo mudou infelismente....desde entao o ocorrido fiquei desempregada e nao consegui ainda voltar ao.mercado de trabalho  "
good,Pois aprendi  muito sobre liderança  agir como dono.fazer a diferença somar com os clientes.
good,A well diversed & completitive workplace. Safe place to work with. Woking cuture is good in the sense of diversity & working condition. Productivity & positive management outlook & looking forward to upgrade in job position in a different & challenging role in the future if given a chance.
good,"Mauvaise ambiance au sein de l'entreprise du fait des teams leader qui en savent pas gérer , prennent de haut et rabaissent les salariés. Une erreur de la direction de les avoir mis en place depuis 2014."
good,"Enjoyed the experience with respect to being able to executate and polish my key skills.  Responsible, dependable, work ethic, and team work.  Must maintain product rotation, display plans, communications with others involved."
good,"Product is moved quite often for placement in store.  This at times seems redundant."
good,"Nabisco was a great company to work for but, after multiple buyouts one felt like a number.  In 1995 the company required all sales force to reinterview for their positions and half the sales force lost their positions"
good,"Its a typical warehouse job. Duties include picking, stacking, stocking, and cleaning. Good people at the location I was at. It can be a lot of overtime hours."
good,"I've been there just about a year and have ben able to learn a lot about logistics and inventory control, while maintaining traceability of product in a high demand facility."
good,"The hours were good, but more pay would of been nice & growth with company would have helped tremendously. Although I was just a stock handler, not sure how well the drivers got it."
good,"A empresa oferece um ótimo ambiente de trabalho, porém não oferece aos funcionários chances de crescimento profissional, optam em dar ótimas vagas aos estagiários e deixam os próprios funcionários nos cargos atuais."
good,"If U R a merchandiser U will have up to 10 store to work.  U may only work 2 a day, other times it may be 3.  Because the product is on sell one week and off sell the next, expect to move A LOT of product from displays to the shelf or to the back room."
good,never the same as your job discription keeps changing when ever a gap is found. No room to improve.where u are is where you stay. your knowlage and exprience dont matter
good,"As , Usual  greet the co-workers I'm familiar with then head to the line I'm assigned to for wrapping the cookies that were sold in bulk, we'd do that until breaks comes , and when breaks done its time to get back to work. The hardest part of the day was when the machines stop working , cause then sometimes they'll put me some where , I'm not in sync with my co-workers, but we manage. The most enjoyable day is towards the end , when everybody talks about what they're going to do when they get home, especially the weekend"
good,"Pagamento em dia , empresa organizada ,limpa, os funcionários sempre tem treinamentos. Líderes sem muita visão."
good,Better warehouse and better hours . We have just a drop yard with no restroom or a place wash your hands. Start times are different everyday. We need more people to help out so it’s not so stressful of a work palace.
good,Tive a oportunidade de trabalhar com vários desafios que me fizeram desenvolver profissionalmente.
good,Empresa boa de se trabalhar só peca na questão de oportunidades de crescimento na empresa.
good,"A typical Day- 9-10hrs "
good,"When I was first hired in, it was Cadbury Adams. The company seemed to actually care about their employees and morale was relatively high. A few years later, Kraft purchased it and there was a management shift. Policies changed and overall morale diminished as we were treated more like digits rather than people. A year later, Kraft divided their candy and lunch meat divisions and we became Mondelez, and it only got worse from there. From then on, management hardly gave you the time of day and morale essentially just depleted. They tried to implement IL6S and ultimately failed, and processes were completely messed up."
good,Up early on the job usually around 6 AM going from store to store merchandising and throwing loads.  Its a physical job so your pretty tired at the end of your work day.  I like getting up early and getting off early.  Management isn't the greatest at times.
good,"Schedule changes all the time usually do not know what shift you are working until the day before. could be working warehouse or driving."
good,"Great part-time job, easy work if you know what you're doing. Nothing too hard. Can be stressful at times. Communication is very important while working for this job."
good,"Lots of work, no OT to finish."
good,"It is a place where work never stops, its always go go and even though you work 10-12 hours a day the managers expect even more.  Feels like there is no win for the salary unless you are upper management."
good,"I worked four months straights I asked off  they made it a big deal.When my grandmother was diagnosed,I had to come home to help and they made me choose"
good,"Non stop working production lines 24/7 "
good,not a great environment to work in I'm not ver happy with the job nor the way I was let go. I have 3 kids and a wife to feed and out of the blue they let me go
good,"A preocupação e cuidado com a segurança individual e coletiva com o trabalho e trabalhadores da empresa é muito rígida, e com isso se torna um ponto muito positivo a respeito da empresa, assim como o cuidado com a qualidade de todos os produtos oferecidos e também com o meio ambiente quando se trata dos resíduos produzidos."
good,"A mí criterio está empresa es buena ofrece muchas prestaciones, solo que a mí se me dificulta por el traslado, los turnos que maneja y en ocasiones con el pago de cada semana, si se tuviera que evaluar con estrellas yo la evaluaría con 3 pero busco un trabajo al que lo pueda evaluar con 5 estrellas."
good,The hours can be really good and really bad at times. If you work hard you can get your days over fairly quickly but if you were to do that every day it would wear you down. That's probably why this job and industry has a decent turnover rate.
good,"Mondelez est une très belle entreprise. Les postes sont très intéressants, les produits et le cadre de travail le sont tout autant. Les équipes avec lesquelles j'ai travaillées sont dynamiques, enrichissantes et très agréables. Malheureusement, les voies que suivent le top management international ne permettent pas d'envisager un avenir plein d'ambition et d'évolution au sein du groupe."
good,"had a list of account to service , i either worked an order or back stock. i learned how to build displays and sell special items to accounts. management was great and communicated with me well. hardest part of the job was working a huge order alone. most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers"
good,"Mondelez is not the place for you if you are in IT and live in the US . All IT job are steadily moving oversees (India and Costa Rico). The CIO is from finance and, as expected, his focus is on the numbers. He doesn't care about people, systems or processes."
good,"The greatest asset of this company is the people. It is sad to see the company has decided to embark on a cost savings road that is resulting in a lot of good talented people leaving the company or just being let go."
good,"People know and recognize the brand name Nabisco and Oreo,they know the product they are purchasing is high quality and well known.  It is a work environment with travel between stores and accounts that requires high dedication and a driven  personality. You need to be willing to work hard. The hardest part of the job is managing things out of your control (late deliveries, computer breakdowns) and satisfying the demands of store and grocery managers."
good,"Firefighting and a willingness to cut deep. Work pace is hectic, demanding, and the expectation is that you'll give 110% without any appreciation. ""No good deed goes unpunished."" Pays well, but without that, there's really not much going for it at the moment."
good,I was happy working there but not completely satisfied.  The work scheduling was confusing at times and not assigned or assigned late. Planning things on your day off was difficult because of scheduling changes
good,"gestion santé sécurité / main d'oeuvre / production / qualité / livraison / coûts /syndicat"
good,"Was at Mondeleze 10 years and held many different rolls in that time. This was a good company to work for with lots of opotunity for developement, although there were always lots of changes and restructuring. This often left alot of work on a person as you would be double or tripple hatting. This crrates opotunity but also unstability and a lack of job secruity."
good,"not too shabby, requires many hours too get it done right."
good,"Je trouve que l'environnement de travail est très malsain entre employés.Il y souvent du favoritisme au près de la supervision.Il y a un mal gérance flagrant ,souvent les dirigeants prennent des mauvaises décisions."
good,"Empresa com ótimos benefícios. Porém, com uma cultura que requer muita resiliência e pouca autonomia."
good,"Es una fabrica de galletas, cuenta con  buenas prestaciones con jornadas de 4x2 de 12 horas cuenta con transporte Turnos de día y noche. Comedor subsidiado"
good,It has always been my favourite work place the only problem i had with the company was that the management did not value oour opinion.
good,"As a merchandiser, you are done when your job is done. Very early mornings, and never a minutes break. It is a very busy job and there is never down time."
good,"Company is not stable since 2012, when it became MDLZ, people do not feel job security, as thousands of talented employees were dismissed."
good,"Large FMCG Company, not a great work culture, very sales driven, strong personalities. Many stakeholders within the business means your exposed to a wide range of roles within the business. There are many opportunities in such a large company , but this business is very much of the mantra of time in the role before you can move on. Company is very much of the mantra ""honeycomb"" effect, meaning stepping sideways before you can go up, which for people who want career progression often get frustrated about"
good,This was good place to work. Good managers and employees. Flexible work schedules. But there was little to no room for advanement.
good,"Os funcionários trabalham tranquilamente, sem uma pressão exacerbada, o que não quer dizer que não haja. Há oportunidades pra quem procura, mas falta algo que considero de extrema importância, o feedback individual para os colaboradores. Sem o este retorno, todos acabam sem saber como está, onde está, como melhorar a performance mantendo o que está bom, e melhorando onde existe à oportunidade. Creio que desta forma todos ganhariam muito."
good,"Some of the best brands on the market that almost sell themselves. Still a lot of good people even though many good leaders and employees have left the organization through all the mergers, acquisitions, restructures and downsizes during recent years.  Top leaders are very focused on international growth and are implementing a lot of cost cutting measures in the US to get the business model more in-line with other countries.  The DSD sales force will continue to be be challenged as resources are increasingly leaned and it becomes more difficult to make the customers needs a top priority.  Company is a huge promoter of diversity."
good,"Typical day's often consist of 12 hr day's with many people working 30 or more day's strait. While the company ( Nabisco ) was owned by Kraft great strides were made with safety and modernization of equipment . but now it is difficult to even get parts to keep things running."
good,"Dia agradável."
good,"Actualmente en proceso de transformación y globalización del Negocio, lo que lleva a externalizar puestos de trabajo y funciones fuera del entorno actual, lo que genera incertidunbre y desorientación hacia el Futuro."
good,"start with staff meeting addressing assignments. how to interact with people of different culture, learning different language. great team to work with. managing schedules with increase volume. getting task done timely."
good,Good Place to work. Challanging Environment. Work Life balance is not so optimum. Applying New technology in the category.Decision making process is slow.
good,la parte mas dificil la diferencia de precios que manejaba yo a ventas al detalle  contra el de mayoreo que hay en el mercado y convencia al cliente haciendo limpieza de exibidores y con servicio cada ocho dias
good,un dia de trabajoo muy bueno es divertidoo y pues luchas dia a dia para lograr tus objetivos gane mucho dinero ahi por mis grandes esfuerzos
good,"Ambiente agradável, pessoas legais para convívio."
good,"Empresa ainda passando por muitas mudanças, mas com marcas boas de se trabalhar como lacta, trident, club social, tang."
good,"begin your day when you would like"
good,"I believe that opportunities is rare in our life that we need to seek on it. this is also how our working expectations. there's nothing could not be changed only the change. yes, i do believe that everything has a reason and everything could be learned and also train by our own self determination."
good,"I make sure to be ready and out the door so I can get to work at least 30 minutes before ‘start time.’ That way if there are delays such as traffic I’m still on time for any meetings or important tasks."
good,Poor systems contribute to a great deal of re-work and offline tools proliferation
good,"A typical day at work starts on your territory which is usually composed of 12-16 grocery stores (ie. Wal-Mart, Harris Teeter, Food Lion, BI-LO, Lowes Foods, Target, etc).  In these accounts you will  write orders, merchandise Nabisco products and of course sell Nabisco product to store managers.  Overall good place to work, fast-paced, high reward environment."
good,Worked here for 2 years (part time) so far and have seen many unqualified people come and go while more experienced and deserving employees get ignored. Not an atmosphere that exemplifies working hard for advancement.
good,"Mondelez is a good starting place for someone just leaving college. There are a lot of opportunities. However, you should be willing and able to move around the country. Those who can't are ""pigeon holed"" into a job limited to the services this facility provides to the company as a global entity. It's very difficult to move up if you can't leave the area."
good,"Very high demand, but with excellent salary and benefits.  The culture of the business has changed greatly and is no longer a fun place to work."
good,I like the job just got offered a better job opportunity. It was a little overwhelming for me at times because of the demands needed to be met but other than that i pride myself for working for a company for as long as i did.
good,A typical day started at 6 am till about 3 with an hour or so of computer work at home. I learned a lot about selling a first rate line of product and in managing others in displaying that product. Although we did not get together often I got along well with coworkers and stayed in touch through e-mail and the phone.The hardest part of the job was the physicality of it (placing 100's of cases of product on shelf and display). The most enjoyable part of the job was reaching product goals within my territory.
good,This job was a great experience and I would definatly like a job that is similar again. Had to leave to finish school and was not granted a transfer unfortunately.
good,"A typical day at work was long but the daily pay was great.  I learned many things.  Working wit machinery, how control stations work, WHIMIS, and other types of chemicals.  People were great to work with and everyone worked as a team.  The hardest part of the job was the irregular shifts and threat of lay offs and most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with."
good,"É uma empresa conceituada, mas não contrata estagiários e aprendizes ( que seria meu caso)"
good,"A typical day involved reams of spreadsheets regardless of task. I did not learn much; I reinforced what I knew; I strengthened my proficiency in excel and access. I had expected to learn computerized accounting. Management was good until the General Manager (GM) retired. I enjoyed a better rapport with him than his replacement or my immediate supervisor, whose disappointment over not getting the GM job affected our relationship, notably his willingness to teach me waned. Co-workers were great. Hardest part of job: realizing I'm not going to learn anything new, much less get promoted. Also, the 2 hr am ride to get there at 8 am. Most enjoyable part: I was kept busy so the day went fast"
good,"É muito bom quando tem uma empresa que sempre faz inovação para os funcionários, que tenha um ótimo clima organizacional."
good,I didn't learn any new skills working for Nabisco. The management worked well with the employees. The hardest part of the job was working behind some of my co-workers who didn't do the job correctly. I enjoyed being out on my own to get the job done and then go home.
good,Not applicable there is not much to say abut the job I did not like it. Was very sexiest and I thought very unethical in a lot of things that where done.
good,"Everyone I worked for/with was very nice. I liked the job fine, but needed more consistency in schedule. Managers were always late no matter which district I was helping, which was annoying but I got accustomed to it."
good,Loved the flexibility of this job and I felt as though I made a lot of connections with different types of people. The job is good if you like working alone with little guidance.
good,Competing with their plants in Mexico and our management was bad. Constantly keeping morale down and making you feel like there was no job security. I have worked here 21 years and enjoy what I do
good,"Local bom para trabalhar ,equipes em  apoio as atividades realizadas pelos colaboradores  e para bem  estar dos colaboradores e proatividades dos mesmo."
good,this company offers a lot of part time work and its somewhat disorganized in management. managers find good help and they overload the good help and this causes burn out.
good,"While you get some feedback, the job is inconsistent no set hours per week sometimes less than promised. And other times, not enough time to do what they expect."
good,Schedule changes consistently and at the last minute. Pay was good for the work however not enough hours on a consistent basis to support your self...
good,Une pression continue sur les employées leur demandant toujours mieux (JAMAIS SATISFAIT!!!!).
good,"Good company, but could use a bit more affirmation to employees. They really focus on what you are doing wrong but don't encourage or commend you for the things you do right. Should also do a better job of standing by their employees."
good,"Um bom lugar para trabalhar,  excelentes benefícios."
good,"The culture was different. There was no motivation in the workplace. People show up to make ends meet instead of loving their job. The product they make is fantastic, but the people who are there are a little hard to work with because they do not want to be there. The workers only want to do the minimum to go home. The managers do not care for the employees. They want to lower costs."
good,Bueno con cambios de turnos y buen ambiente. Lugar cercano
good,Muy buena empresa para técnicos recién egresados.  N
good,Rotina e horários stressantes e cultura multinacional.
good,"Buenos turnos rotativos de 12hrs 4 por 4  mucha papelería,  formatos de llenado manual y electrónico para casi todo, pero Buena empresa prestaciones de ley categrorias un poco tardadas pero con el paso del tiempo se obtiene buenos aumentos de año Dan galletas en diciembre pero no hay utilidades solo bono de produccion"
good,"Empresa é boa e agradável, multinacional porem com poucas oportunidades de crescimento"
good,The job is alright pay is low alot of driving for minimum pay . Supervisors are very rude  and its not a friendly work environment.. mileage is not paid on time
good,too many cuts during the year. management adds additional pressure. management does not help. just sits back and expect everyone to make it. company changed a lot.
good,"Nos me gustó los contratos anuales. Siempre me liquidaron al 100 pero no creas antigüedad, en dos años trabajando ahí nunca pude tramitar crédito de Infonavit por qué perdía los puntos al cumplir el año."
good,"Fun team, great perks and some great managers that tried to engage learning and involvement. A very corporate structure that took away from the learning. Flexible work/life balance. "
good,I was there too long and did not feel the job was ever going to offer me anything. Many stores had their own policies and there was not much of strong support to the employee to support his duties as merchandising the numerous stores.
good,"Fun place to work, management needed to be replaced. There were many issues with the lines that needed to be addressed such as out dated machines and parts."
good,Good stable work however over the years the culture and foundational corporate values became consumed by self serving management that lacked integrity. Union creating a inflexible environment and driving up Mfg. costs to maintain U.S. competitiveness.
good,In my position as Sales Service Representative I am responsible for working orders received in the store. The goal is to get the products from the pallet to the store's shelves and occasionally building displays with various products. The work is basically stocking the shelves and rotating the product by date to be sure all products on the shelves are fresh. In this position you receive your work instructions by e-mail and you are responsible for accomplishing the work.
good,bomavisibilidade    e posição n mercadocom bomdesenvolvimento para seus funcionarios
good,"Trabajo muy cómodo.. exelente clima, compañerismo."
good,"ok but not updated on key information and taken on as temp staff but not informed "
good,i learn so many things specially in displaying and monitoring stocks... i learn to be more productive so i can do my job in proper... i learn the importance of the product i should buy
good,"International company, with many good employees."
good,Es una buena empresa pero  la paga no se compara con otras como P&G o BASF o DOW en la industria química
good,"You have to have thick skin to work here. There are a few nice people but there are more bullies. Training is mainly done by temps who have little to no experience or whose first language is not English and for the most part, hold poor communication skills. It is a very loud environment, having designated trainers that speak in a clear loud tone would be an asset. Instead, already stressed supervisors put you in front of the machine and pair you with inexperienced underlings and expect you will know what to do & bark at you when you don't. It is stressful & frustrating. You are shifted every 2 hours because the work is quite tedious, but the pay excellent, it has to be, no one would stay there for minimum wage."
good,It is a decent place to start out in the work force as the hours are very flexible and they are good about working around volunteer work or school with their scheduling.
good,"traveling, working long hours, ordering merchandise for several stores, stocking the stores with their product, and meeting your monthly and quarterly quarter."
good,"The job was relatively easy, but through the years they started putting more work on merchandisers. It used to be 2 loads a day, about the time i left, it was up to 3-4 loads per day. Your day would be long and stressful if you had a sales rep that didnt know how to properly order products. Bad on your back and knees as well. I left as well as others because not getting an opportunity to be promoted."
good,Overall good place to work but very structured environment. Certain type of Logistics jobs are very time oriented and require weekend and evening involvement.
good,un dia tipico es ver que todos los sistemas esten funcionando correctamente para enfocarse ala meta y a su vez ver como seguir mejorando con la gente y los equipos para una mejor autonomia.
good,"Não tenho o que reclamar, entrei como auxiliar de produção e em menos de 3 meses passei para como responsável pelas massas das trakinas."
good,Mondelez is a good company to work for with good benefits.  The union employees can sometimes be a headache with the entitlement attitudes. Overall the supervisors do not get the support from upper management.
good,"Découverte du métier RH, complet et enrichissant."
good,Very hard work. Little or no recognition. Only very minimal yearly raises 3% or less. Up side good work out. Wear ot your own vehicle unless you are a rep. Wear out your body parts never enough money for that.
good,not good place to work as the work is too hard and will kill you with the time. It ver fast and labor intensive job. You can't get any chance to relax and its always standing and bending for full 12 hours
good,"Es divertido, el ambiente de trabajo muy bueno. Gracias"
good,"Reasonable work-life balance, but bad office politics.  Learned a great deal about consumer goods manufacturing best practices.  Management was subpar; workplace culture was stressful."
good,"This is a great company to work for; there is no perfect plant."
good,"Didn't work there long it was a part-time job, but good company to work for. Good management and team members. Pleasant work environment never a dull day, and Great benefits for full-time workers."
good,"Mondelez es una gran escuela. Propietaria de grandes marcas como Oreo, Club Social, Trident, Halls, Cadbury y Kraft."
good,"I started at the bottom and was given several opportunities for promotions  Good place to work and grow"
good,The days were long and could also be really short. The schedules were made last minute for anyone who isn't full time. It's an uncoordinated job with a lot of expectations and very little acceptance for personal needs.
good,Mondelez takes care of its employees. The management team is comprised of professionals that allow open discussion. The invntive nature of the marketing department is legendary.
good,"They lie, bad management, SSRs R 2nd class cit Bad local man no comm. love job went from 30 ish hours holidays to 6 hours weekend got raise lost hours"
good,Stocking shelves in different stores everyday gives you the opportunity to work with a variety of people and customers.   It is challenging when customers assume you work for the store and know where everything is located. It can also be challenging when stores place requests for displays to be changed at specific times.
good,"if you take your job seriously and try to do everything asked of you, you will soon need high blood pressure medicine."
good,Working at Mondelez was stressful but i did like the hours i was getting. The managment was rude and not helpful. The pay should of been more for the type of work i had to do.
good,"The company has decent benefits, great PTO time, and allows for good work/life balance."
good,This job requires a lot of body movement.  Lifting and opening packages.  Checking codes on boxes can be taxing.  Overall the time worked in early AM which gives you the rest of the day.
good,"US focused. Canadian people neglected. With present political scenario - Canadian people cannot move to US also. "
good,Det var väldigt att jobba på internationalt företag som Mondeleze.
good,"I was with the company for 5 years.  I started as a part time merchandiser and moved up to full time after about 2 years.   After a structure change, I was given more responsibilities with no increase in compensation.  After some time of doing this job and being passed up for people right off the street, I found work elsewhere."
good,"Nice work environment The only downside with Nabisco is not knowing the work schedule. It was day to day, sent out via e-mail the day before for the next day. One could not make appointments unless made in weeks in advance."
good,"Se vive un buen ambiente de trabajo, se valora los logros que hay en producción, aprendí a trabajar con alimentos a ser líder de una linea de producción, avance en  mi trato con la gente para lograr un mejor avance en la producción."
good,"the sales job was flexible . got to meet alot of people and it was fun,doing something different everyday.it was not easy some days but it a good company to work for"
good,"Je travaille habituellement 12 heures par jour et ça me convient. "
good,"Company good work requires great physical ability sometimes unpacking and shelving 150 cases in a supermarket,"
good,Con muchas ganas de trabajar en una empresa que sea para repartir o reponer mercadería
good,Schedules changed according to management desires more than actual production needs. Great pay for the area. Personnel turnover rate is fairly low. Decent benefits.
good,"Uma empresa boa, aprendi muito no tempo que estive"
good,"O trabalho é repetitivo, quase sempre igual, porém em alguns casos havia a necessidade de fazer a interversão  na máquina o que tornava diferente."
good,"Mondelez International is a good place to work if you are a college student, they pay well and are flexible with your hours. I've never had an issue getting time off, either."
good,"-Implantar constantemente objectivos"
good,Worked part time for them over 20 years ago.  I couldn't comment on current work environment but was a fine part time job many years ago when I worked for them.
good,"Punctuality, dedication and long hrs has to be put in for production. Employee benefits needed are there.Safety of employees is also the priority.Opportunity to grow is also available to certain groups"
good,"Due to corporate greed, outsourced 600+ jobs. Everything is seniority based despite how better at the job you are, everything goes to the old guys. Low seniority are treated like slaves, repeated 16 hour shifts because you're the newest and someone on the next shift called off. Some  of the best pay and benefits tho"
good,I didn't dislike working for this particular company all the time but the lack of organization and communication from leadership made it my least favorite job.
good,"A good company to boost your experience as you will be exposed professionally. Mondelez adheres to her policies and strict about its compliance. In general, its a good place to build your experience."
good,"Great pay and benefits if you can deal with crazy grave/swing combo shifts, and a very lacking training program. But FREE medical for the union that I work for as one of their maintenance guys."
good,"For three years I stacked cookies and crackers in grocery stores for Nabisco.  It was not a bad gig, but it held no growth opportunities.  They were only interested in trading labor for dollars."
good,"Stocked the floor, maintained the merchandise in the backstock, rotated merchandise, helped customers, and set up displays. Most enjoyable part was having the independence to do your job on your own, although you do consult with store managers concerning displays and such."
good,The company has nice benefits for the employee. Have a reliable car to transport you to the stores and a good thing is they pay for gas. Manage you time.
good,"This is the old Mondelez International.  This company was spun off and is now owned by Heinz Foods.  Overall good place to work, haven't heard great things about it since the merger with Heinz."
good,Merchandisers are given minimal hours and are overworked for the few hours they are scheduled for.  Time management is not considered and merchandisers were expected to meet goals that were not feasible with the time constrains.
good,4 ans en tant que manager dans le domaine de la logistique.
good,A good company to work for but there aren't a lot of opportunities to move up. The push for increasing sales puts a lot of undue pressure on everyone.
good,"typical day at work : 8 hours a day"
good,"Alguns gestores estão desalinhados com os objetivos da empresa, incluindo o GPTW."
good,"10 - 12 hours are typical per day with some weekends.  Receive calls at night and weekends.  The plant I worked at lacked a team atmosphere with the management team.  Production crew works 280+ days a year on swing shifts.  Pay is average to above average, benefits are average."
good,"Great pay and benefits"
good,"The job requires long hours, ability to be on feet and moving all day, and ability to thrive in a fast paced work environment. It is a little stressful but not terrible."
good,Fixing industrial grade machinery and fabricating custom pieces incase of damage or if  missing. During spear time we were assigned small projects to keep us occupied as for example creating a mall conveyer.
good,Excellent product line to sell. Local management is not the best. Lots of free cookies to eat is a perk of the job. The hardest part of the job is the long hours.
good,"Es un lugar con excelentes prestaciones y muy buen sueldo, claro que con tiempo extra, las decisiones de ascendencia de puesto, dependen mucho del supervisor de cada área, me dieron la oportunidad a un puesto mejor pero la supervisora no me lo autorizó. El lugar es muy caluroso y haces limpieza cada que se cambia de presentación del producto."
good,"praca fajna trochę monotonna,ludzie w pracy są różni mimo tego brygadziści i pracownicy dbali o dobrą atmosferę w pracy i szacunek do drugiej osoby"
good,Buen ambiente laboral y con excelentes normas de seguridad sólo que tuve ciertos problemas con mi supervisor debido al mal manejo de poder debido ah horarios demasiado pesados y muy poca flexibilidad en casos urgentes
good,"Compliments personal schedule"
good,"Atuar com rotina de conferência e apuração de ISS para entrega de obrigações, análise e aplicação da legislação para correta emissão e recepção de notas e aplicação de retenção nos serviços tomados. Conciliação da conta de imposto ISS, atividades de lançamentos, conciliação e demonstrativos, dar apoio ao setor de controladoria, emitir os informativos acessórios (DMs, DSR e DS), emitir guias de recolhimento, realizar entrada de notas fiscais de mercadoria e serviço, entre outros."
good,all. the co-Workers help each other for the same common goal at the end of the shift. its was a safe place to work.the hardest part was the summer because it be too hot in the plant.
good,"Ótima  empresa, que exige um trabalho dinâmico, pois se trabalha com público e com vendas. No meu caso foi um trabalho temporário,no qual  trabalhei na Páscoa com vendas  de ovos pena que foi só um trabalho temporário ."
good,Mondelez was a good company where they invested in a lot of training. The company taught the staff how to be leaders and were always looking to improve. Hours were rough and never followed their work/life balance.
good,"mejor manejos de inventario,señalizacion de ofertas,control en pedidos,"
good,Got along well with co workers. Friendly environment and excellent teamwork. Everybody worked really well to produce numbers.
good,Working from home is promoted and a huge bonus. Fun work environment. Job security is non existent. Too much out sourcing and moving jobs over seas. No room for growth.
good,"A 'top down' culture to the company has typically lead to an impersonal view to the workforce and a potential to adversely affect 'work - life balance'."
good,"The hardest part was a mean old man, who would say awful things to me. I learned that I stronger than I thought. I really like meeting new people at the different stores."
good,"We operate different kind of packaging machine,i had learned a lot mechanical and operating skills.Management are great and generous.All my co-workers are friendly and nice people.the hardest part of the job is when they stop and go the bake same as start up.the most enjoyable part of my job is when i learned to work  with different kind of people and treat them like my own family."
good,This is a pretty good company to work for. The hours are not to bad and there is room for advancement if you are willing to travel or move.
good,"The company did a good job of taking care of their employees from what I experienced in my few months there. However, the sales representative role was not for me."
good,"xxxxx snd, es repetitivo, ya van varias veces que lleno esta rubro de la misma empresa y las mismas preguntas."
good,"MDLZ has a great corporate reputation and is an extremely ethical and responsible company. Like others in its industry, it's been under constant pressure to cut costs and streamline operations, and the ongoing restructuring over the past several years has taken a toll on people--but company has been delivering better performance in the past few years as a result, and it's clear there's some culture change happening."
good,"Good organization.  Will test your limits in an ever demanding industry.  Very fast paced...however, perpetual change is unsettling"
good,"Fast paced days, learned a lot about merchandising for grocery store and what is entailed. Management lacked good communication skills with employees. Hardest part was staying in time restraints at stores to get through all stores scheduled."
good,fun place to work. good people. work life balance is good. company car is nice. pay could be better. district managers are a roll of the dice.
good,Due to the global aspect of the facility some products are slowly shifting to other facilities around the globe causing concern to many employees. The income is amazing here but the stress levels continually increase with the worries of relocating products. The management is pretty fair as they have attempted to give me and others a chance to grow with the company. Overall a solid place to work.
good,"Nice place to work, its an R&D pilot plant. we make gum and candy. its a great company, amazing company, very nice to work here. "
good,"Modelo de negócio e processos muito bem definidos, boa interação entre liderança e funcionários, boa relação com os pares e salários e benefícios satisfatórios."
good,"en un dia tipico en el trabajo yo llegaba y organizaba todo lo correspondido a la empresa y si faltaba algo informaba al punto de venta para que me colabroraran con eso."
good,"There was a lot of variety in what I did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting. My colleagues made the work environment really enjoyable."
good,Aprendizado com os Sistemas Integrados desenvolvido pela companhia.
good,Job security doesnt pay well very fun job seeing different people and performing different task great benefits. If the benefits matched the pay or they just paid more period would have stayed at this company
good,"Was a good place to work, good people to work with. Busy at most times. But unfortunately, layoffs came so that the company could save money by using third party employment."
good,"The company has changed its culture many times due many reorganization, which results in job frustrations and insecurity at the workplace. Nonetheless, it is still a giant and a good company to work for."
good,"boa de trabalhar ambiente bom"
good,"Typical day.   Drive to first store of day, reservice/work order."
good,"just what i said. company is not fun to work at anymore. its always a gridlock, promoting the wrong set of people. hiring the wrong people to do the job. turnover is getting ridiculous."
good,"Replenishment Specialist: "
good,"As a Nabisco merchandiser we communicate over emails in regard to schedules, ad plans for major retailers, and any changes within the company. I recieve my schedule a day in advance through email for the next work day. In that email it contains the store location, case amount, and time of arrival of the product that I will work within the store I am assigned to. When I arrive at the store my job is to work the backstock out first, check for out of dates, and fill any holes on the sales floor shelf with new merchandise that came in from the truck that was delivered. During holidays and special events  I may be assigned to coordinate with store managers to set up special displays for ad's. After the sales floor has been filled my last task is to organize any remaining back stock in my company's designated area and go to my next store."
good,"I worked independently at a variety of different grocery stores such as Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Kroger, Wal-Mart, Target, etc. I received specific instructions the night before fro whom ever the Sales Rep I am working for. I would work truck orders that ranged from 20 cases to 150 cases or more. Some days I would just go into a store to do a re-service. Meaning, I would just go into the store to check the shelves for holes and front all of the product up."
good,"Same opinion as the last question. The company was about making money only.  no concern about health or wellness. worker emulated leadership, cut throat type of atmosphere.  The physical lifting all  day was a challenge after awhile."
good,excelente empresa multinacional donde hay un muy buen ambiente de trabajo.
good,"It was a very nice company,good coworkers,clean building,i always have people to help and answer my questions,the most enjoyable part of the job was the interaccion with the people from the offices"
good,"8 hour day, same thing over and over. I have learned to respect team "
good,"A la ocupación efectiva durante la jornada de trabajo."
good,This company is going through lots of transition. They continue to cut workforce but expect the same output from their employees. The brands they represent are iconic and a pleasure to represent. I just wish that the company culture aligned.
good,"Practicing public safety as well as following company procedures. Unloading trucks, down stacking freight and stocking them. Rotation of products by dates.I usually work alone, but the hardest part of my job maybe telling customers that I don't know where a product that's not my companies are located.The most enjoyable parts of my job is seeing different people from different areas and helping them get their Nabisco products. Communicating with complete strangers and feeling 100% comfortable."
good,"Great experience in a fast pace sales environment. Each Representative is assigned a geographical territory in which they apply Nabisco go to market strategies in order to further company market share and profits. Co-workers in the field are great. Management can be pushy when it comes to achieving some of the high objectives. Hardest part of the job is relationship management with grocery store managers. Most enjoyable part, being a representative for a company with great brand recognition."
good,It would always be a good day at work. There's always good challenges that would open to learn more about the job. My co-workers would always be approachable and easy to talk to. The most challenging part of the job would be keeping up with add rotations and making sure we kept our displays.
good,Working with the company it has its challenges but its a lot of fun along the way.
good,"Giornata di lavoro gestibile a seconda delle proprie necessità/priorità. "
good,"A typical day at work is always planned as per product running on line."
good,A place that was easy to work for. Consisted a lot of data testing. CAD skills are needed if you want to impress. Meeting many people from different countries was also good.
good,"es una empresa que respeta los tiempos de cada persona laborado dentro de la empresa, la atención con la gente que su salud no es la mejor o la optima, tiene la mejor disponibilidad para su gente cuando se presenta algún problema y los riesgos profesionales son muy atentos y su preocupación es la mejor."
good,a day at cenveo consist of operating a forklift and shipping large amounts of envelopes .
good,"Capacitacion y buen trato con personas de diferentes puestos"
good,Management and people were easy to deal and work with.  It was quite fun working for this company.
good,This isn't your typical 9-5 job everyday could be different. On a daily basis you could be spending time in 3-6 different grocery stores merchandising product and building displays. Its nice because you're never in the same place and you are always meeting new people. It is a pretty physically demanding job where you are on your feet and lifting most of the day. The grocery business is a little tough these days and consistency in hours and benefits are rough on the average employee.
good,This company has a strict merchandising method that you have to follow and you have to be certified on. Starts times vary on territory and delivery times. RMS want you to sell displays to stores and get them out on the floors which is what the sales reps jobs are.
good,"Se atienden fallas electricas, electronicas e intrumentitas en todo el turno."
good,"I typically hear from my sales rep between 10pm-12am the night prior to my work day to tell me where I will be going and what will be going on in those stores. Management is great, but some of the reps could use some more training and people skills. The hardest part of the job is occasionally dealing with angry store managers and receivers if the sales rep has not communicated to them what is going on with Nabisco products in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is trying to build a good report with the managers, receivers and other outside vendors."
good,"Was offered a position that was in essence created for me. As time went by another member of our management team was demoted. The company felt that he needed to have less responsibility. So they decided to give him my position. I was told to train him for this position and stand in for him when he could not be present to perform the duties expected. I did so. I soon found that he was unable to perform these duties quite often and at a very high rate of pay. While on the other hand I was continuously present at a very low rate of pay. Previously, I did not mind doing my job at the rate of pay I was offered with bonuses. My bonuses were removed and given to him and my pay rate was lowered to the service rep position. Now I was doing ""his job"" which was ""my job"" previously at a very low rate of pay.... All due to this manager not correctly handling his position I was now being taken advantage of.....I chose to seek employment else where."
good,Bardzo dobrze byłem zaangarzowany na 100%praca sprawiała mi dużo przyjemności
good,productive and fun work place but with difficult career advancement. Good work/life balance and diversity. Company is saving money which affects people's advancement and career possibilities
good,"Hire you as full time but do not guarantee 40 hrs per week, this makes it hard to have a budget when your hours are unknown from week to week ,seniority is king! If you are a new hire you can expect to take a vacation in January or February forget about a week off during the summer"
good,No team players and lacking communication from manager to supervisors. Lack of training employees and supervisors and creating SOP's. The changing of hours without a heads up.
good,I went in found my order and start putting it out on the sales floor. The I rotate proctect on the shelf to the oldest to the newest. I went to different stores each day.
good,"empresa passando por mudanças, "
good,Good place to be. The company is strong and the benefits were very good. Union environment is tough to get used to. Most people I knew were very happy to be there. Who doesn't like making cookies?
good,"Stocking shelves daily, ordering merchandise if full time sales rep or a sales rep. Learned how to order merchandise for store shelves and weekly ads. Hardest part was meeting management expectations most days and keeping stores happy."
good,"It was a high pressure position, fundamentally I learned a lot with this position.  Few management members at the time I worked there were very toxic, and a very high management turn-over due to it.  There will always be bad apples but the position they were in did not make for a pleasant work experience.  Overall I would recommend working at Mondelez due to the knowledge I gained working with the good individuals that were not in it for themselves."
good,"If you are young and want money then this is a great job, but if you have a family that you want to be able to see then this job isn't for you. Good benefits and money. Unevenly split work throughout the warehouse workers and everything is seniority based so get used to the bad end of the stick until you get a few years on the job."
good,"This job is not a bad job to work at. It's easy the mangers are there for you they make sure your comfortable and those are all great things but this is where you probably consider another job. "

good,"I liked working here. However the hours for part time staff are varied and non predictable most days. One day you work 2 hours and the next day you may work 6 hours. They offer no benefits for part time staff, which is one major negative."
good,"équipes middle management très soudées."
good,"It was a stable place to work for 15 years and then things changed to a more streamlined work model. Many branches were closed, some were good choices to close but many others were not."
good,"After I left the company, and went another company . I realized how it wasn’t that bad. They did put more work on merchandisers by making them do 3 or more loads a days as opposed to doing only 2 loads per day a few years ago. That’s when that job became harder than it should have. "
good,I enjoyed my time working at this organization and representing the highly visible brands.   It was a good experience and good building block of skills.
good,"Typical day consists of stocking,rotating products in multiple stores per day and working independently. Sales reps send instructions by text or email. Worst part is getting yelled at from store personel because there is too much product. As part timer, no benefits,not great pay, and heavy workloads at the end of each period throughout the year."
good,"Went to the first store, stocked shelves and repeated until all stores for the day were done. Worked with management when they would be at the same store. Had to have a working relationship with store managers. Which can be extremely difficult if a store manager did not want your product to go in a certain location."
good,"lot of field work but very nice colleagues "
good,"12 hour rotating shifts, on your feet the whole time, some people work and some people pretend to work so you'll do double  also you will be breathing in sugar all of your shift and you will come out covered in sugar... this wasn't the place for me."

good,"Top CPG food company.  Strong culture and leadership. "
good,Mondelez can sometimes be a difficult place to work but they do compensate well and have good benefits plans and room to advance if you're willing to put the work in
good,"A typical day as a Sales Rep for Mondelez International starts at around 7am. The rep goes from store to store to stock the shelves with Nabisco products and ensure the product is executed properly, then the rep writes an order for the next delivery and communicates any changes in the ad with store management. Sales Reps for Mondelez do not usually get to work with other employees, they are out on their own in the field on a daily basis. All company communication is made through emails and phone conferences."
good,"I was given the opportunity to increase my knowledge in production, machine operations, training, safety, continuous improvement and quality control. I created SOP manuals and trained new employees on machinery. Updated MSDS binders, facilitated and implemented safety training to employees. The hardest part was the change to continental shifts, but I have made many friends over the years there."
good,"Empresa multi nacional com uma grande estrutura para crescer e se desenvolver. Aberto a ensinamentos diário, mas restrito a receber idéias de funcionários que estão dia dia nas atividades."
good,"08:30 di mattina fino a che nn finivo il lavoro "
good,Friendly place to work at...friendly management and easily approachable.  Good paymaster and good workers are recognised.
good,Very physical job but it pays very well for what you do. If your young and very active then you will love it. Hardest part is the hours and the schedule.
good,"Worst - got laid off in less than a year from employment"
good,"I am responsible for building point of sale, filling shelves and making sure new items are cut into the display, and neatly merchandised shelves. A major objective is to maintain rapport with key individuals while providing outstanding customer service. I work independently, but love to work beside others. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the finished product and taking pride in all the work that has been done."
good,Very demanding with great rewards and benefits but the work life balance is no existent. You keep very busy with projects and calls.
good,"Very physical, you aren't stuck in one place, Depending on the type of person the sales representative is makes the job enjoyable or not."
good,"Empresa agradável de se trabalhar, tem um pacote de benefícios interessante e satisfatório, porém está em um processo transitório de mudança da cultura organizacional onde tem sido muito puxado e acaba sobrecarregando os funcionários em algumas atividades devido ao grande fluxo de informações e construção de kpi´s que passaram a se tornar necessários para a gestão do dia a dia."

good,"Traveled between 4 stores and stocked merchandise, counted merchandise, and unloaded freight"
good,"I am assigned certain stores each day that I work ( usually 2-4 stops per day). I get started at 7am  and work the orders delivered to those stops and/or pull backstock. I change out displays as needed each week for ad sales. My management team are great people, very friendly and easy to get along with tho I dont have any benefits of any kind. The hours I work are between 25-30 each week."
good,"En esta empresa aprendi muchas cosas tales como te involucran para tomar desiciones, te inculcan valores, y tambien te capacitan para nuevos programas en sistema, una empresa que tiene una vision muy grande, exigente y que es una muy grande en el mercado internacional."
good,"Responsible for customer service, ordering and promotions for 19 stores."
good,It was a much better company and environment in my opinion initially than at the end of my career with Nabisco. The economy at the time played a large roll in the changes Nabisco under went during the early 90's. Met alot of fine people that I worked with and out in my territory.
good,"Marcas fortes, foco demasiado e rigoroso com atingimento de metas."
good,"I learned the red prairie system learned, how to intake and disbatch driver ,and how to make moves in the que. I also did damages and, count backs in the RF."
good,On a typical day I traveled to stored and stocked shelves. I learned about sales and retail. My days were not very consistent since my hours were based around delivery times and the amount of cases brought in on any given delivery. It was fast paced at times and could get a little stressful.
good,"It is a nice company, that is competing well, they still have a long but interesting way and journey to go though. The culture is fine, in that there is no room for discrimination."
good,A Mondelez é uma empresa que oferece os recursos necessários para você demonstrar o seu potencial.
good,"Everyday is new and exciting. Meeting all different types of personalities. There are many challenges that come up everyday, but you learn to fix the problems or reached the management for advise."
good,"A empresa tem passado por muitas mudanças em todos os sentidos, algumas favoráveis e outras que deixa a desejar. A 4 anos atrás o sentimento era outro, a empresa sempre valorizava o colaborador, o compromisso com os valores da empresa realmente existiam. Nos últimos 2 anos, após as mudanças de liderança, esse sentimento não é mais sentido pelos que atuaram na época. Objetivo apenas PRODUZIR. É impossível não comparar com o passado, que infelizmente não volta mais. O ambiente de trabalho deixou de ser agradável e passou a ser desagradável. Uma pena que tudo que existia de bom foi perdido, esquecido, excluído..."
good,"Worked at the New berlin,Wi location before they closed its doors. For the most part I had liked working there. Mondelez does a lot of preaching about safety, caring about employees, integrity,etc. Then one day they walk in from out of state somewhere and tell you they dont need you anymore. You were really just an expense to them. Some of those guys had been there for decades, and it was just like they didnt care at all about any of us. It was sad because things had really been starting to seem to have come together. Between the new day foreman & the night foreman they had really started to find a way to streamline things to be more efficient and make the days shorter than they had been in years. Even the recent holiday season hadnt been so bad, Things had definitely been looking up. Then upper management snaps their fingers and poof, its all gone! Maybe all of that recent focus on efficiency was because they knew we were on the chopping block."
good,"All ok, is all up to how each individual take it and manage it forward."

good,"L'ambiance au travail est agréable et permettait un bon équilibre avec la vie de famille, malheureusement la compagnie et pour des raisons de relocalisation de sa production a décidé de fermer son usine de Montréal."
good,"Nabisco is a great company that provided both challenges and benefits.  Lots of free product, taste testing etc.  High pressure sales, daily updates of % to goal vs. % time elapsed.  Direct store Delivery meant you have to be able to adapt on the fly due to traffic delays, broken down trucks etc."
good,"Organizations of  teams responsibilities"
good,"* Rotina com uma alta demanda de tarefas"
good,"The salaries were cut 14% the last 6 months of my employment, however the hours worked were fair. I learned a good bit about managing different personality types in a sales role."
good,Typical day is taken up with meetings and emails. Management is focused on meeting numbers and will often reach out after hours to log on and do work. You do NOT get paid overtime and any extra hours put in do not count towards anything.
good,"Expected to work Overtime. "
good,"Je travaille sur une ligne de production qui est très productif.  Ma journée de travail commence par vérifier le code du produit que nous produisions.  Apres je vérifie les standards de la boite, du sac et le produit. (Quality Suite).  J'alimente la machine de production de matières premières. J'ai appris a travaille avec Quality Suite, les BPI, le cadenassage, HACCP et aussi apprendre a faire des ménages allergènes. Je travaille avec une équipe qui se soutient et on s'entraide beaucoup entre nous. Notre patron est toujours avec nous quand qu'on a besoin de lui. Le plus difficile est de faire des ménages allergènes et de travailler dans l'humidité et la chaleur et le plus agréable est de travailler en équipe et d'apprendre d'avantage sur les machines industrielles."

good,"I learned with Mondenlez productivity,self management, team work, leadership. "
good,"Es un muy buen lugar para trabajar, sin embargo constantemente la empresa sufre cambios, esto no favorece mucho el trabajo, le falta mucha mas capacidad a las personas que contratan."
good,"Has great benefits, but pay is not enough for the amount of workload. Co workers are nice people, but there are not enough to work smoothly on a shift. Need to hire more people and give raises."
good,"The training is excellent but it is difficult long term. Very physical, high pressure work.  Hours can get really long. An average day would be around 9 to 10 hours. Thankfully no weekends if you get full time work."
good,"Une belle carte de visite."
good,"Its a job good for part time students who don't have a lot of burdens. great environment to work for both young and old. working at night is pretty hard but once u learn, u will get through"

good,"Very supportive collegues ,help each other to achive the company goals and meet their KRA ."
good,"This would be a wonderful job if you got the extra workers you need to finish the job. If a truck with your delivery is late, your whole day is ruined."
good,The management of the company needs to have a closer relationship with their salespeople in the field. The job does have good benefits. It is very apparent that some of the clientle in their accounts has little or no respect for the salespeople that go into their stores.
good,"Mondelez International is a company where you can learn to be creative, outspoken and manage your business. Mondelez International strive for excellence for there customers."
good,Es un lugar donde te podes sentir a gusto y tenia buenos beneficios
good,My management team worked around my busy college schedule and still got me a decent amount of hours while I was with the company. Having the freedom of being on your own and working more or less on your own time is nice. My only complaint is that I was given less than 10 hours per week during my last few months even though I said that I was available to work 20-25 despite my school schedule. Hourly pay also could have been better.
good,Good company to work & get an experience. Co workers are friendly. Benefits are good. On time salary. Area of visit is just easy to find. Follows what is stated on DO 174
good,It is a good company and Train you well. I found out quickly how hard a job this is. 200+ cases of product comes in 2-3 times a week. If I were younger I would work here. Pay is not enough for this position.
good,"On a day to day basis the job was great because you got to interact with a wide variety of people you wouldn't normally interact with on a normal day. The job taught me a lot of skills one being how to deal with customers in a professional manner."
good,Hard work but fair pay. Hours can fluctuate depending on the time of year and demand at the time.The training program is a little sparse but the necessary functions of the job and how to do them well can be picked up if you pay attention and have a willingness to learn.
good,"Cultura flexible, muy cambiante, y muy cordial. De vanguardia en muchas prácticas,"
good,Plaisir de travailler pour un grand groupe dans une structure à taille humaine.
good,Management needs lots of approvement. Workers feel like family base. The company was concern with quantity instead of quality. I feel that is a major issue with Mondelez International.
good,"É uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, mas  não viabiliza a transferência de um setor para outro, mesmo o profissional possuindo os requisitos. o plano de carreira é vertical."
good,Good place to work but not a lot of advancement opportunities. Raises were annually but were not significant raises. The people in the stores you work with were good people to work with. The job is not extremely hard but it is challenging
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar.Sempre cumpri suas obrigações salarial,algumas pessoas dedicadas outras nao  como em qualquer lugar,reconhecimento  à  alguns ,porém  nem sempre havia oportunidades ,pois haviam abertura de vagas mais externas."

good,"I always enjoy in working with Mondeleze International ,I learned how to mange Multi tasking projects individually, discipline is another main factor. Mangament was fair enough in the limited resources, My coworkers were very kind and cooperative. The hardest part of the job was man power due to which we had late sitting to fininsh day to day task."
good,"I started with this company right out of college and have been blessed with great opportunities and quick advancement. I have learned a lot in my various roles, all which have given me a well rounded background in sales and the CPG industry."
good,Steady job. If you are in the right area you will always get hours. Unfortunately they have only been hiring for part-time. Last but not least moving up in this company is pretty hard. Good stable job though.

good,"Your basically a glorified stocker, if you dont mind stocking shelves then this is the perfect job for you, I started out pt and there super flexible, basically you make your own schedule if you want sat off you get it if you can only work monday n tue then thats all you will work.. Once I became full time they dont work with you anymore your there slave, you dont get 2 days off in a row no weekends off unless you take a vacation day if someone cant work they just ad it on your schedule even if theres pt persob available. Pt do work the holidays mostly... The pay in the midwest is good for this type of work.... As the full timer you have alot of stress dealing with management from the stores cause your always out of product and the shelves are empty.. The busiest times of the yr and your out of stock on products. So the stores are pist and you have to deal with it... Then you do build displays once in a while.. I like building the displays more then stocking of the shelves, cause it makes it look like you actually acomplished something...  It is true you cant move up past a sales rep if you dont have a degree, cause you know college kids no more then the ppl who have 20 yrs of retail experience... Moral is down in our area as well do to the fact that dsd might be ending and noone knows if there even going to be working after the new year.. So do your research before coming aboard... I tried giving the best explanation on how the work enviornment is..."

good,"This is a casual role for someone who needs flexibility with work hours. Would suit a uni student or similar. Not something that you can do forever, as there are little to no opportunities for advancement unless you want to relocate."
good,"it was a good job and pay was decent. hours are long at time and can be stressful but overall would recommend this job, manager was great and worked with you"
good,The pay is great and so are the benefits. Working mostly on your own during the day is different. Must be self driven. A ton of unpredictability from week to week in terms of daily and weekly schedule.
good,I'm not that into retail but this job isn't bad.  It just doesn't interest me much but I still do my work with 100% effort because I do have respect for some of the people there.

Lo mas dificil quiza era entras en lugares complicados con plata y mercaderia y lo que mas me gustaba era que las horas de trabajo dependia de la velocidad con la que yo hacia el reparto y depositaba la plata en el banco."

good,While it would be awesome to write a review for many place that I have worked sadly I would have very few good things to say except perhaps some of the nice people I work with.
good,"As a full time associate you are obligated to clean up behind previous associations and service representative over the territory.  You have to expain extra time in store due to not enough time given to service where this was never the case. Weekly schedule hours get changed  within 24hrs with little notice.

good,"Never know what these snack companies are doing to cut costs. One day you have a job , next day you're not sure if you will in 2 months. They don't keep you in the loop on anything. Very low turnover because of pay and benefits. If you're a driver, you have no life, and you get no sleep until the weekend . Very long routes with tight delivery times, just to keep less trucks on the road to save $$ not keeping in mind sometimes you'll be waiting at stores for other vendors: 12 hour days are normal, and you're back in 10 hours for another. Always preaching safety safety fatique fatique, but they have no idea. Absolutely zero opportunity for advancement."

good,It wasn't that bad for a part time job but it is the only job I could work 7 days in a row (happened often) and not even make 30 hours a week. The other people who worked there were amazing to me and made me feel welcomed from the start. All and all if you need just a part time job and like to drive around than apply. Like I said it wasn't the worst but does need some fixing.
good,Empresa agradável porem com uma dinâmica bastante desafiadora.
good,Muy buenas prestaciones pero él sueldo es bajo muy pocas oportunidades de crecimiento la oportunidad de obtener planta es muy poca
good,"I really enjoyed this job because it constantly kept me busy, and there was always something to do.  A typical day at work was shelf restocking, and establish professional relationships with Store Staff. What I learned from working at this company was bettering myself as a communicator, since the job dealt with constant communication.  Another aspect of the job which is the hardest would be meeting the requirements to finish a task in the amount of time given, I was timed in each store to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job was I had the ability to start my shift as early as I wanted to, and that gave me the chance to finish my job early."
good,The job is more than easy and I loved that part. It was just the management that wasn't to my liking and I worked like crazy but wasn't well respected and I didn't enjoy working for a company that's not family oriented.

good,"Trabalho corrido e com movimentos repetitivos."
good,"Working for Mondelez has been an eye opener for me because I have a store to store sale position. I am the go between for corporate  and store level management, trying to find a mutual agreement on displays and product marketing. I must have open communication with my direct manager on a daily basis to give store by store feedback. The least enjoyable aspect of my job is being told that the space you need or a display is not available making it more difficult to complete the order. I truly enjoy the physical aspect of my job, it keeps me on my feet and in motion, also not having a direct boss over your shoulder while working makes it less stressful."
good,"Our typical day would start at 6am when the trucks usually arrive at"
good,"This was a great and productive company to work for at one time.  A lot of corporate issues with the company at this time.  When you start to see a lot of employees take buy out package, this tells me that you aren't happy with your job status."
good,The typical work day revolves around delivery times of product at the stores. The employee is basically on their own to schedule their work around the deliveries.

good,"Great company to work with but it there is no room for me to grow in my career"
good,I really enjoyed working for Mondelez International. They can work on their scheduling a lot better to make it consistent for their workers. And their management needs a a lot of work. I noticed during the 18 months that I worked with Mondelez International they have a really really big turnover in employees.
good,"Mondelez was a great first career opportunity that enabled me to apply my technical skills, as well as develop my soft skills. I was able to gain cross-category experience and work with global teams."
good,A job in which you can excel. Management is changed every year and it is very difficult to talk to with problems since they dont know all the business aspects throughout the years I have worked there
good,"The work is fast paced but not difficult at all. The LAZy incompetent coons make the job hard if anything. Excellent pay and free insurance for union members. If you are interested in working here be prepared for gossip, back stabbing, god awful employees, disgusting roach infested work environment. Management is ok. Sometimes I have to ask myself if this job is really worth my sanity."
good,"Not a lot of future with this company. Looks a though DSD is on the way out, leaving a lot of qualified reps searching for work. Pay is below national average."

good,"Transitioned over the years from a highly collaborative culture to a segmented functional organization that was less efficient and frankly less fun.  Great colleagues and less great Management.  Hardest part of the job was maintaining project momentum against the tide of individual production plant mandates and differing goals.  The colleagues I worked with over the years were highly motivated, skilled and in general great fun to learn from and work with."
good,The days are filled lots of hard work. The longer you are with the position the faster you will get at performing the job and then it will get easier.
good,"Buena convivencia dentro de la empresa. Con algunas fallas en liderazgos tomando en cuenta como objetivo principal siempre el alcance de los GE e indicadores."
good,Working with Mondelez was enjoyable .  It just did provide me with fulltime hours at the time . I enjoyed working with management and  the working relationship that I had with them .
good,"As a quality tech at this placed you are hired on as a non union employee. This would be nice except for the high tension and bad attitudes between the two separate groups, which makes for a awkward work environment."
good,Average Work. Good working culture . Flexibility . But poor in documentation and keeping standards in coding and other activities. But process oriented company
good,Good job BUT you have to start off Part Time.   IF Nobody leaves or Retires you never move up.   Schedule is frustrating because it's day to day.  You can't plan anything as a Part Timer.  Plus NO Benefits as a Part Timer.  In addition Pay is weak for entry position.

good,"Basicamente era tranquilo trabalhar na Mondelez ,não foi a toa que permaneci por quase 7 anos nessa empresa.Aprendi a ser mais proativa,dinâmica,sociável assim como interagir entre grupos.porém a grande dificuldade não só para mim mas como para outros colaboradores era a constante mudança de liderança e gestores dificultando nossos desenvolvimento promocional na empresa,pois os anteriores não tinham o hábito de passar informações sobre o trabalho dos colaboradores.A parte boa,ótima era os benefícios que a empresa oferecia,cursos,disponibilidade de horários,pessoas qualificadas para orientar...."

good,"Trabalhei ate um dia antes da pascoa, responsável"
good,"Working on the sales team as a merchandiser, the job can be frustrating at times. Working with the store personnel can be challenging at times. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with others that did the bare minimum and got away with it because when the sales reps reported it to upper management, it was ignored."
good,"routine work"
good,"Nabisco had a wide range of positive and negative aspects of the job. You got the chance to work with a wide range of people, had a somewhat of a flexible schedule and company cars were a wonderfull perk! Unfortunately the compensation and advancement opportunties were not there."
good,"Easy and boring work.  Pay is really low.  Work hard and management will definitely help you move up, but the few jobs above are held on to so long you may have to wait many years for an opening to even exist."

good,Excelente experiencia enriquecedora que permite crecer y aprender dia a dia en un marco cambiante.
good,"I worked alone a lot and had to rely on myself to overcome obstacles.  The job was very social and fun at first, leaving me with wanting more hours and responsibilities. I was able to prove myself enough for my boss to create a job title that I could use my skills in. The job soon became one in many territories throughout the U.S.  I left the company only because my job now took too many hours a week and the people in the jobs I might get promoted to were very unhappy in those positions."

good,"A typical work day involves visiting about half of the stores in your territory, writing orders, pushing merchandise and talking with store personnel.  Your schedule is basically determined by the delivery schedule and the stores that you need to order for.  You deal mostly with Store Managers, Grocery Managers and their assistants.  You are responsible for all of your shelf displays as well as special promotional displays.  You have one or merchandisers who work for you, that you give instructions to daily and answer questions.  However, you generally won't see your merchandisers that often since they should be pushing merchandise in stores you won't be visiting on that day."

good,"el trabajo empieza con una reunión matinal, donde se les dan instrucciones a los vendedores y supervisores de lo que va a pasar en el dia,hasta el mediodía estoy en las zonas evaluando gente y visitando clientes y por la tarde controlo las acciones del día y la facturación, Eventualmente me quedo en la oficina para planear y delinear las acciones a seguir, en estos días la parte mas difícil del trabajo es la motivación del vendedor y hago mucho hincapié en que no se caigan y se pongan la camiseta día a día, con mis colegas tengo una relación excelente y lo que mas me gusta del trabajo es conseguir metas diarias y llegar a todos los resultados,"

good,"O dia-a-dia de trabalho é atipico, tudo pode mudar em um instante. Aprendi nesta empresa a ser mais proativo, ir atras dos meus próprios resultados e alcançar as minhas metas sem esperar que outras pessoas me ajudem. A direção do site é focada, direta e objetiva, cobrando os resultados de todos de forma bastante profissional e transparente. Meus pares agem como time e constumam ajudar quando solicitados. A parte mais dificil do trabalho é lhe dar com egos inflamados de alguns gestores, A parte mais agradavel é a oportunidade de aprendizagem constante, pois o ambiente é bastante desafiador."

good,I worked at Nabisco for almost 18 months. The average day would start early in the morning and would consist of going from multiple stores stocking shelves full of product. The shifts would vary anywhere from a four hour day to a twelve hour day on weekends. Management was good until new management arrived. It was here when I was still employed while going to college that I was no longer being given hours. After repeated calls to my new boss I was always met with being ignored. The co-workers are a good group of people to work with. The hardest part of the job is getting into a rhythm for the day to move quickly and efficiently.

good,"Day typically starts at 6am meeting truck load at the store.  2-3 hours to unload and shelf a couple of pallets of stock.  Work backstock to the shelf.   Then on to 1-3 more stores to replentish shelf stock.   Normal day is 5-10 hours.   Usually don't see the final daily schedule until the afternoon on the day before.   Co-workers are  competent and easy to work with. Various retail stores have different policies and proceedures.   Exact time is allotted for each store project which is usually less than needed.  Must call in to justify and ask for extra time needed to complete.  You MUST hustle.  If you work slow, you will not last here."
good,"Dedicada a la producción alimentos en cuatro categorías, galletas, polvos y bebidas, quesos y viscosos y gomas y caramelos. Cuenta con 3 plantas de manufactura en México."
good,"Going in stores and building relationships with store management, selling displays, and working product.  I have learned time management, selling skills, and sales break down.

good,"As an intern, I as able to do a rotational program, shadowing different positions for about 1-2 weeks. Throughout the internship, my mentors provided great insight on their specific duties while allowing me to perform tasks as well. The most difficult part of the internship was trying to work out contracts with your clients."
good,"Review, analyze payroll adjustment submitted by TA""s supervisor.  Enter into SAP and make corrections."
good,"Mondelez is a great company to work at. The co-workers are friendly and helpful, the manager is always available to assist with problems. the best part about working there was definitely eating as much chocolate as you want. the hardest part was coming in at 6 am on Saturdays. Working there was definitely a learning curve especially since I am fresh out of university. Everyone was helpful and worked together to ensure that everything stays on target. At the end of the day its team effort that results in success."
good,"Très bonne expérience pour avoir une vue vraiment globale de la Supply Chain, nombreux contacts avec interlocuteurs internes très variés, dimension internationale."

good,"i work shifts, I have learn a lot during this period of 3 years "
good,You can feel the power of the former Kraft Foods giant with a feel of a modern European work space. Very open office environment with friendly co-workers. Con's far from city center. Difficulty with advancement.

good,My typical weekday started at 4-5 in the morning and my weekend would start at around 6-7pm.  The hours were extremely demanding. Often times I would go right from my Saturday shift into my Sunday morning shift.  That was easily the hardest part of the job considering I would have class on Monday morning.

good,A typical Monday morning started with a 3 hour drive to Georgia with a stay for the week. I learned about working with front of house management and back or house employees in a grocery environment. The workplace culture and what I liked least were also the most difficult parts of the job. Store managers and many employees did not always act professionally and many times with a complete lack of respect. The best part of the job was working alongside other hard working and personable sales reps from other companies and the store's employees that could be described the same way.

good,Mondelez provides great pay and they do provided good work-life balance.

good,I was treated fairly at this company. management was fair about solving any disagreements.the job is not hard at all you work at your own pace.most of the time people there work as a team.
good,The hardest part of this job is preparing for the unexpected. Rather it be a surprise buy in or arriving to find everything in disorder. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there are always new people to meet and there is some flexibility with your schedule.
good,The time of my employment at Nabisco is too far removed to offer a fair and balanced assessment. I left to start my own business.
good,The strength of the organization is in the employees that work for the organization.  All are very bright in their areas of expertise and drivers to meet the objectives of the organization.

good,Dia dinâmico com necessidade de viagens e muito relacionamento interpessoal.

good,"Really enjoyed my time with Nabisco, my only reason for seeking other employment is for lack of hours I am retired and have a real need for a part time job and really need at least 20 hrs. per week, also the paid millage is way behind time as far as cost today."

good,"Aprendi a resolver e encarar os problemas no dia a dia como eles são, sempre com respeito com relação a outras ideias diferentes das minhas."
good,"In this plant you must be able to handle pressure. As a supervisor there are many difficult situations that will arise everyday. The name of the game is do not waste product, keep everyone safe, and make sure the line never stops. I have learned to stay calm when others do not see the light at the end of the tunnel. Keeping upper management up to date on every situation is key. The good managers here will listen to the supervisors and get the resources they need so the line will run more proficient. Everyone here must be an expert at there job. We have to many moving parts to have anyone slip up. Getting everyone trained and on the same page is key. The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing good product leave the building for the consumer. This means there is a demand for our product and our jobs are safe."
good,Mondelez really cares about people. I am very fortunate to be part of this starting snacking company (after splitting from Kraft Foods - previously NABISCO). I was given the opportunity to go to United States to do knowledge transfer with my newly role Fixed Asset Senior Accountant.
good,"Part time merchandiser --  Mostly physical work; stocking cookies and crackers on grocery store shelves.  Once you get the routine it's not that bad. Semi trucks drop off the work load at each store and you drive to each store (paid mileage in between stores) to work the product ordered by the sales representative, who is in charge of your day. Each day varies depending on who you work for. Can feel stressful and overwhelming because of the variety of work involved, but with time it becomes a more ""standard"" job. Worked here 7 years and the people involved are why I stayed so long. Also, early mornings are required, like 6am-7am, but the true benefit to that is being off work between 1pm-3pm."
good,"very physical"
good,"Very intense work environment, but with very good people. Speed,"
good,"very hard technical work, fast pace environment. I learnt a lot there, co workers are ok, management are young and energetic"

good,"Es una gran empresa para aprender, el ambiente laboral es muy agradable. Sin embargo, hay veces que algunas cosas son más complicadas por los mismos procesos de desarrollo."
good,"The flow of things of mondolez broadened my understanding when it comes to merchandising as a whole. It was great working for the company that is just into every occasion , i was able to adapt ofcourse because of the support i got from team members and as i have mentioned my Representative"
good,"Benefícios excelentes mas sistemas integrados muito estressante, pois o colaborador tem que cuidar das máquinas e ainda de seu processo."
good,"It’s good for a part time job, hours can change from 20 to 40 per week or from 40 to 18, not a dependable check if you have a family or bills to pay."
good,"Empresa otima para se trabalhar, facil adaptação e bons treinadores que auxliam desde o processo seltivo quanto na integração."
good,I did not spend enough time there to judge how working at mondelez international is. I did not communicate much with with the management people in the office.
good,"Sobrecarga de trabalho em determinados setores, liderança coagia alguns funcionários, fazia distinção de pessoas  e idade e gênero"
good,"Regles de sécurité obligatoire, regles d'hygiène irréprochable trés bonne expérience professionnel"
good,This branch is stuck in the past with how to do things.  The management is lazy and ineffective.  There is no reason to have a brain there since no ideas are used and its all about keeping overtime down even if overall man hours goes up because of it.  Sending the better employees home early to keep ot down.  I was verydisapointed in
good,They are a great company to work for. The manager I had was very understanding and worked with me to get sales up. I’d recommend working for them. Good luck.
good,"After two years one would think the pay would be over $15 per hour due to the extreme physical work that is required as a merchandiser."
good,"Be prepared to work. Long day and in the evening "
good,"Great environment. Benefits are amazing, free cookies very Friday. Coworker are very friendly but too much favoritism. And everything gos by Seniority"
good,The only complaint I have was the commute to work. Work was done at a comfortable pace. Communication between leadership and employees was adequate and encouraged.

good,"empresa comprometida com segurança e qualidade, e capacitação de seus colaboradores, ambiente seguro, gestão de sistemas integrados. nos proporcionando vários cursos de capacitação. ponto negativo é a gerência que promove pessoas por afinidade. empresa comprometida com a entrega de produtos com excelência."
good,Empresa em constante mudança buscando se tornar cada vez mais competitiva.
good,"I wonderful job opportunity for those who love to interact Face to face with people and push your product for sales."
good,"Uma empresa que ganhei muitos amigos , experiencia profissional maravilhosa vou levar comigo pro resto da minha vida , só as partes de oportunidades que deveriam ser abertos para todos , e as promoções que deveriam ser pagas assim que você assume o posto de trabalho , demora muito"
good,"It is very fast paced, be ready to move, so wear comfy shoes. Great team of people. One bummer is no benefits or discounts as an employee. Its a good job for someone who does not like to sit still."
good,Heavy lifting and stocking. Display building and moving. hard work but worth it in the end. some weeks I got extra hours and other weeks I didn't get very many
good,"very hard on the car and not really a good place to work with a new car, has little to no time for break's , very kind RMS and understanding , helpful co-workers"
good,"If you thrive on last minute deadlines and constant change, this is the place for you.  The company is in constant change and the workloads are a little to much at times.  The senior leadership changes every 3 or so years and you must learn to adapt."
good,"Boa empresa, cultura ainda em desenvolvimento. Boa empresa para trabalhar."
good,"Ótima empresa de se trabalhar, bom relacionamento entre colegas"
good,"MDLZ is a good place to work and tries to maintain work-life balance."
good,Mondelez has been good to me since I have been working there for only about a month and a half. I have reciecived considerations to move into a higher position as well
good,L'environnement de travail est conviviale et stimulant
good,"Se labora con mucha seguridad, su proceso es muy limpio y tienen muy buena calidad de sus productos"
good,"You will indeed enjoy your pay but other than that, things can definitely be a toss up. Upper management will not recognize you as a person. You’re just a number, so standing out is a bit of a task within itself."
good,"Overall satisfaction on aspects of salary, benefits, people, management and culture is high.  Speculations surrounding the company being acquired by other company are constantly plaguing the workplace.  Management continues to change hands."
good,"i work as  a maintenance and EHS executive, so most of time is in factory. checking the safety of the employees and machines, and also scheduling of preventive maintenance. break down maintenance"
good,I great place to work! I don't have any complaints! You can make a good living and the work is not that hard. The hardest thing is coming to work. the work is easy.
good,"The work is very interesting, however the management set-up is less than ideal. New staff are treated better then long standing staff. There are minimal percs."
good,Merchandised various grocery stores between 5-7 AM. Built displays and ensured customer satisfaction. Dealt with store directors and store personnel. A lot of driving around.
good,Learned a whole lot with this company. For the most part it's a good company to work for. Great compensation and benefits. A lot of upper management turnover.
good,"Excelente empresa para trabalhar, excelente benéfico s estabilidade oportunidade de desenvolvimento profissional."
good,It was a fun place to work with the coworkers I had a round me.  The management team went through a lot of changes while I was there.  I learned a lot in my time there.
good,Went through allot of changes the last 2 year's. Never felt secure about company's future. For the time being good place to work as a Sales Representative. One complaint would be that the part time help are never held responsible for there performance.
good,"Boa empresa,peca apenas na parte de efetivação e na organização"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, aunque poca comunicación con la central."
good,"- Flexible hours"
good,Great work place but culture is not very good. difficult to have a good work life balance. Very lean and the people in the plant are very old school type and reluctant to change
good,"long hours"
good,"While the work was fast paced, and at first, my back muscles hurt HORRIBLY from being out of shape, after I got used to the work, it was very fun.  Pretty much got paid close to $20 an hour to get a workout, and have a fun time at the work with great people!  Plus I did the same thing my dad did, so I got to see him every day."
good,"Worked there for 40 years. They provided the best training and insurance. I would still be there but many of us had to take early retirements due to jobs being relocated to plants in mexico. I did many different jobs sanitation, Utility worker, etc."
good,"Uma empresa muito boa,onde apreendemos muitos a cada dia"
good,The company has a very solid market and is driving for results to be number 1 in the products if produces. Typically I will work 5 days a week around 10 hours a day. Mondelez is a good company to work for.
good,"It can be a better work place if management would just let there workers work without being on them all the time , and also if mondelez would give some type of benefit for your back and feet cause its a killer on both things."
good,"A empresa esta sempre inovando, procurando sempre alternativas de melhorar e aumentar a produtividade, com mudanças na forma de trabalho."
good,A typical day at Mondelez would be very hard working your on your feet all day and constantly moving around. The workers you met there are usually older age and have been there for a very long time but are very friendly and helpful at times. Some of the mangers care about you but like most places you have some that obviously do not care.
good,"Uma empresa multinacional, sempre preocupada em aprimorar nossos conhecimentos no ramo de merchandising, com cursos online e presenciais realizados mensalmente. Investiam também com treinamentos voltados a nossa segurança no ambiente de trabalho.

good,"Mondolez has a fast paced, stressful work environment.  Associates are expected to work keep up with a hectic pace, while keeping mistakes to a minimal percentage.  However, you are well compensated for your work, and the opportunity for overtime is abundant.  The management consists of interns who are in training for other positions.  This is a great place to work, if you are able to be self directed and solve problems on you own."

Apesar das mudanças os gestores se empenham em fazer o melhor e a cada reunião, isto é passado para cada funcionário.

good,"Uma empresa que me ensinou muito, ter disciplina no horario, responsabilidades sobre datas de vencimentos, me deu a oportunidade de hoje estar podendo cobrir férias do Coordenador Regional."
good,aprendi muito com meus colegas de trabalho e tambem com meus lideres pois eram muito prestativos e com vontade de nos ensinar
good,"The company provides good benefits.  There is a casual dress code, so emphasis is on work not appearance.  Company is downsizing and outsourcing, so there is not much job security.  Coworkers are professional and easy to work with.    Work load is heavy and generally requires overtime hours (unpaid) on a regular basis."
good,"A empresa não é ruim de trabalhar, o serviço não é pesado, máquinas com baixa complexidade, climatizada e benefícios de empresas multi-nacionais ."
good,"Gran experiencia laboral,desde mis inicios era solamente una empresa tabacalera y se transformo en una mega empresa de consumo masivo."
good,"é um local muito bom de se trabalhar aprendi muito, como alem de trabalhar na produção também trabalhei no inmetro que significa pesagem de biscoito se ele esta dentro do padrão se não tiver avisa os operadores para eles  abaixar ou aumentar o recheio a parte mais dificil do trabalho é que demorar para ser reconhecido a parte agradável tinha bastante umor entre os colegas e o lider pois sou um pouco timida  fora isso éra muito bom trabalhar nessa empresa."

good,"Mondelez International is great for career development opportnities and cross functional development. Relocation in Logistics operations is mandatory, but is often a good opportunity for employees to expand company knowledge base. As a consumer-driven organization, it is a very reactive business. Structural changes are not well communicated or well-developed in advance, creating a lot of unnecessary stress and work-load on managers.

Future promotional opportunities are likely but often unclear."

The part that isn't so wonderful is being out of town. I am tired of driving so much, there's a lot of miles put on my car. Our meetings are once a quarter and that's fun.

Os benefícios são ótimos, tanto para o funcionário como para sua família. Porém necessita de atenção especial na área de Recursos Humanos e alguns setores de dentro da fábrica. Muitas vezes a empresa acaba ficando em falta com seus funcionários, pois não o estimulam a serem melhores ou anima-los para seguir em frente como, saberem reconhecer um bom trabalho, procurar ouvir as ideias dos operadores e suas insatisfações, procurando tornar o ambiente de trabalho mais agradável para todos. Também necessita de atenção com seus funcionários novos, auxiliando em suas tarefas e acompanhando seu desenvolvimento.

good,"well, this would be tough, since I worked both as warehouse and as a driver. So, let's just tell you what I can. Starting out working there was Great, working for Morris, old boss, was always a good day, always smiles!! Don't get me wrong, it's still work, we still had to do our jobs and we had our busy times...but when Morris was the Boss,...Much, Much easier of a work place!!! Now as a warehouse worker, you would put on your headset if you were tossing, listen to what the voice tells you what to pick, toss the item or items on the conveyor belt and move on to your next product. If you were catching, you would be at the end of the conveyor belt putting product on a pallet with the bar code facing out. Building pallets by cubic inches, so it all depends on the size of the order if it is more than one pallet. At the end, you wrap the pallet up and put the pallet on the truck. Now as a Driver, you start out early in the morning, get your paper work and hand held in order, do your proper thorough inspection of your truck, check your miles, mark down your time, and head out on your way to make deliveries, while making deliveries, making sure of getting proper signatures, securing loads when needed, and always making sure if you have a lift gate that it is up at all times. When returning to the branch from deliveries, do a post inspection of the truck, do your paper work, and check with supervisors.

good,"Una tipica giornata di lavoro comincia con una riunione mattutina per ogni linea/reparto di produzione per analizzare problemi del giorno precedente o necessità impellenti per la giornata corrente. Sulla base di quanto raccolto dalla riunione, ne esce un piano d'azione giornaliero che deve portare ad un impiego di risorse mirato a risolvere i problemi puntuali significativi non ancora eliminati e le azioni più importanti per prevenire eventuali complessità. Oltre al piano di azione giornaliero, si elaborano ciclicamente dei piani di azione a medio-lungo termine per poter risolvere i problemi cronici maggiori e ottimizzare i maggiori limiti produttivi. L'ambiente di lavoro è un buon mix tra giovani e gente con esperienza, e in generale il rapporto è cordiale, informale e solidale. La parte più difficile riguarda il fare fronte agli obiettivi, molto sfidanti essendo questo uno stabilimento di un gruppo multinazionale, perciò ogni giorno bisogna convivere con la pressione di portare a casa risultati in linea con il budget e con gli standard della compagnia. La parte più piacevole è che è un tipo di lavoro che ti mostra a 360° la complessità di uno stabilimento industriale e ti pone sempre davanti sfide nuove."

good,"Mondelez is a good place to work. There is a decent work-life balance in most roles, though some positions require more ""extra attention"" than others.

good,"My time at Mondelez International was a great stepping stone in my career advancement.  I began my career with Mondelez International as a Sales Representative at Kraft Foods, which later became Mondelez International.  During my time as a Sales Rep, I learned so much about DSD sales structure and about how to manage your business to control waste and cost, while driving sales and making objectives.  Experimenting with different selling styles and building personal relationships with buyers was a major factor in my success as a Sales Rep.  As a manager, I managed 40+ direct reports, both full time and part time.  This position was very rewarding and I grew as a person and as an employee during my time in this role.  I was responsible to managing the labor budget for my entire team, as well as being held responsible for achieving sales goals of approximately 22,000,000 annually.  The hardest part of this job was the retention of part time employees, and the most rewarding part of this job was being about to coach and improve employees performance to see them thrive in their sales environment."

La parte más difícil del trabajo es acomodarme a los nuevos procesos de las nuevas empresas que tomaban el liderazgo. Todas venían con nuevas formas de ver el negocio pero se logró entrar al ritmo de trabajo y las exigencias que pedían. "
good,"My day started with walking the aisles of the store and recording what items I needed to pull from back-stock. I would then go to the back-room and pull the back-stock and place on the shelves. If needed I would build displays and place products on each display to make product more marketable. Rotation of products. Stocking product to full capacity. Customer service. Entering work via phone or internet. I had no issues with management and I generally worked alone. The hardest part of the job, was sometimes I would work a 14 hour day. The most enjoyable part was seeing all the products on the shelves and displays packed out to capacity."
good,I enjoyed working at Mondelez International and would have continued working there but the company moved our production to Mexico. I learned many skills there and advanced in my knowledge of production.

good,"The job is a great place for entry level employees but leaves little room to advance.I try to make each day enjoyable for my self as well as coworkers. Overall moral is huge when trying to make your numbers. My direct supervisor is easy to get along with and we can always find him if needed. I try to learn any aspect of the job that I am able, this includes different departments. I also am not afraid to come in early or stay late when needed.  The hardest part of the day can be the monotony but a positive attitude can help to over come this.  If we can reach our quota and still have smiles, we know we had a good day."

good,A typical day involves getting to the store I need to work at between 9  A.M. and 10 A.M. Some days do require earlier times but pallets with merchandise typically arrive between that time. I travel to each store and work whatever load has been delivered. I have learned the day to day operations of stores such as Wal-Mart and Kroger. You have to learn to be a people person or it must come naturally. I usually work my route by myself but my manager will sometimes end up working one of the same stores. The hardest part of my job usually involves having to work a big load of merchandise by yourself. Sometimes it can be a little overwhelming and time consuming if you have a lot of other stores that day. The most enjoyable part of my job is I do not always have a boss watching my every move. I never do anything wrong but the freedom and trust extended to me is very nice.
good,"If you are a hard worker, and are willing to start early this job will give you lots of satisfaction."
good,"Every Night before my next day at work I usually would recieve a phone call or email from my territory boss who would tell me what he wanted me to do in that store that day. When I arrived to the store I put my step stool in the ground and walked around my aisle and around the store looking for displays. I learned how to rotate stock, keep back room looking neat, making sure all the product was out."

good,I really enjoyed my time at Mondelez International both times. It's an excellent experience to kind of work for yourself and build a repour with all your stores.

I have learned how to manage my time better and work consistently. The management for Nabisco is mostly organized but has their flukes. I actually don't see my co-workers because it is a one man job.

good,"The job itself was a job that I always wanted. I had a lot of knowledge in there but the management was always shorting people on their pay, shorting people on proper raises, as which happened to me. I found out later that I was making over a dollar less than workers that didn't have the seniority or the experience that I had and the union didn't do anything about it. How I could get an advancement, then find out that I'm making less money than others with no advancements or seniority is beyond me ?? The management was very unorganized and failed to meet the standards of Kraft foods, which lead to the separation of the two business and the laying off of roughly 25 people. It's a shame that a $35 billion per year company would try so hard to short pay their employees. Now you know where they get their money. The majority of the people there were great, minus 2 or 3 that had a chip on their shoulders and could ruin a person's day really fast. They also would favor the Portuguese workers over anybody else. While I was there, we never had a long weekend and were always pushed to work mandatory overtime on those weekends. They would tell us that we had to work on Saturday's, sometimes a half an hour before going home on a Friday evening, then make the afternoon shift workers come in for 8am, which ruined everybody's plans."
good,Un día típico de trabajo es con mucha actividad y nuevos proyectos. Oportunidad de aprendizaje.

O legal da direção é que sempre reunia os funcionários na praça da empresa para conversar sobre as mudanças."
good,"Uma empresa boa de se trabalhar, um ambiente agradável, um salário de acordo com o mercado de trabalho, plano de saúde e outros benefícios. Uma cultura muito difícil de se trabalhar com alguns colegas, pois necessita, sempre dizer o que se fazer todos os dias sobre o seu trabalho do dia-a-dia."

Certain individuals are willing to remove anyone who may have potential to grow past them, and have went out of their way to remove new employees who have showed great success. I created a plan within the first few months of employment that gave the plant immense savings, however was conspired against because previous manager showed great jealousy by not being able to complete task themselves."

good,A typical day at Mondelez varies. On any day expected the unexpected and be prepared for a change to occur. I have learned working and people skills since I've joined this organization.

I would say the hardest part was when you were tired at the end of the day on busy days and you still had more stores to go to and you didn't want to work overtime but you knew you had to.

good,"Un día típico era los bnos dias,hacer lo que tiene que hacer uno sus trabajo,aprendí a darles por su lado a cada persona encargada de los departamentos por que eran 3 los departamentos que yo veía,y sabermela llevar bien con todos alejarme de la gente negativa por que te traen muchos problemas tanto laboral como personalmente,sobre la gerencia presentarme con ellos con una confianza que creo yo nunca se negarían a reprocharme nada,mis colegas pocos pero saber con quien confiar y con quien no,ya que me hice de mas amistades en las tiendas que los mismos promotores por que creo que ese era mi trabajo mantener una buena relación con los encargados de tdas que con los mismos compañeros,por que a fin de ctas son competencias y todos queremos vender para mantener nuestros trabajos.la parte mas difícil saber como presentarme hacia los gerentes y subgerentes por que cada uno traen sus ideas y cuesta trabajos convencerlos para poder negociar espacios y exhibiciones,lo que mas me gusto es que ahorita que no tengo trabajo me dicen que me echan la mano para entrar a trabajar con las tiendas los mismos encargados,pero se las politicas de tda y sus reglas una vez entrando a trabajar con ellos,y los promotores me están echando la mano buscando trabajo en promotoria o en cualquier otro lugar donde me convenga economicamente .eso es lo mas que me gusta saber que mi trabajo lo realize bien y conocer mucha gente lo cual si les puedo ayudar en algo lo hago con gusto."

good,"Mi día, llegar a la tienda y frentear, revisar faltantes, precios. visitar varios departamentos Linea de Cajas, Abarrotes y Lácteos. Aprendí a luchar contra corriente puesto que no creían que tenia la suficiente habilidad para lograr los objetivos (sacar a flote unas tiendas en números rojos). Mi supervisora siempre me mostró su apoyo y confianza para realizar el trabajo, me exigió cuando fue necesario y se vieron los logros a causa de eso. Mis compañeros me enseñaron a querer aprender rápido y a esforzarme cada vez más. Me auxiliaron cuando lo necesite y me dieron consejos para tener mas logros. Siempre que entras a un empleo nuevo debes aprender el manejo de la empresa en mi caso lo más difícil fue limpiar la tienda del inventario ya que Mondelez maneja fechas muy cortas en su caducidad y la tienda estaba muy saturada de inventario y mercancía caducada. Lo que mas me gustó fue sin duda el día que escuche que las Tiendas a mi cargo habían salido de Números Rojos y estaban creciendo en las ventas. Eso me hizo creer más en mi y me dio el respeto de mi jefe y compañeros."

Needless to say my coworkers didn't care for this too much!!  But, this did make them work harder to  beat my sales goals and in turn our team was often the lead team in the district.

Had great relationship with my co-workers and with the management. Learned to accept challenges and had to learn to overcome some of the moodiness of my co-workers and to stay focused on the job to produce a quality product. The most enjoyable part was the job satisfaction and getting paid for it. I learned to ignore the negative and to concentrate on what was important and put my energy into that. The hardest part was to accept that it is ending, would have liked to stay few more years but also am going to remember the few I was lucky enough to have."
