rating,review
bad,"Very little collaboration going on, micro managing and poor leadership skills drive this company. Engineers are treated like gold and if you are not an engineer you are not respected for what you bring to the table. My leader fabricated her departments accomplishments in a professional group's magazine."
bad,Little or no room for career advancement unless you are on the ‘favored list’.  Poor leadership.  Slow to respond to employee needs. HR is supportive of managers more so than employees.
bad,"There have been recent changes in the company that have left many people with low morale"
bad,Very hostile and toxic environment to the point I could not do my job. Management plays favorites with employees. Micromanaged. If you report a problem then your life is made miserable
bad,"Over almost 8 years, the workload for this position has gone from basic administrative assistance to client-faced. Daily workload includes timesheet review, expense report review, numerous reports, follow ups, workload management for a team of 10+ engineers to include planning and scheduling of workload."
bad,"Durch Einsatz im gesamten Bundesgebiet und Ausland kommt es zu einer hohen Belastung. 50 Stundenwochen sind eher die Ausnahme als die Regel und viel der Arbeit muss über das Wochenende erledigt werden. "
bad,"Hard to get to fired"
bad,"For many years I've worked alongside family and friends, enjoying the family mutal trends that a lot of my peers promoted to me when I first started.  I believe that our company does care about our clients and how we promote engineering and reduction of risk.  "
bad,"They will get you interested with the great benefits package, but this company is no longer secure or a very good environment to work in.  Management style is archaic, inept and the company is peppered with nepotism. They hired McKinsey to come in and get them ready for agile.  The outcome was to layoff many employee's, even though there was no need to at all.  Many were over 40 and are very good at what they do.  This has negatively affected morale and productivity greatly.  They put the entire IS department through a lot during the process.  They eliminated over 150 jobs and made everyone re-apply for their old job, knowing very well who they were planning on letting go, regardless of the outcome of the interview.  Yet, they kept nearly  all the managers, many of which are quite inept.  They laid off too many people for the work load and worse yet, they aren't ready for agile.  It is clear management made these decisions too quickly and with no real plan surrounding resources in place.  Managements expectations of IS are unrealistic. The open floor seating is horrible and makes it hard to concentrate.  Zero privacy.  No work from home policy.  Things seem to be getting worse, not better.  The pension isn't worth it.  Sad that this is no longer the company it used to be."
bad,"Overall I enjoyed the job until I received a new manager at the beginning of my second year. He had very poor interpersonal skills, and he had a hard time understanding me as a person. This led to him being somewhat ruthless in terms of the expectations of the job, and eventually forced me out when I could not keep up. Not that I wasn't where I needed to be, but rather he made sure to make it seem like I was not to give justification to fire me. "
bad,"A nice building to work in, but if you are applying with any experience or education it means nothing. People get moved departments due to years of work and are giving job roles with no experience."
good,"there is no comment I have to describe another company, please use your own judgement on this because this would be a biased question and its not good"
good,"Your happiness depends on the manager.  There is very little room for advancement due to low turnover. There is strong job security but small yearly compensation increase,"
good,"After coming from a larger insurance company, it's amazing to me how FM Global stays in business. The IS management has no real industry skill, and most of them only have their jobs because they've been here forever, ""Tenure over merit"" should be the company motto."
good,"I assisted the vice-president in his day to day work by completing daily, weekly, and monthly reports and projects as they came up."
good,"I'd rather not answer any questions about FM Global"
good,"Been with FM Global since 2007, The culture has change a lot since I first started, the department that I'm in has a culture of only providing advancement to people they socialize with."
good,Small insurance office.  Headquarters are in Mass so little chance for advancement.  Busy work environment.
good,"The travel was excessive, the values in goals changed often"
good,"Stable company, good benefits and pay, but absolutely terrible management - most managers are horribly unqualified to be in charge of people and take credit for the work of others. Also, too much nepotism and more lateral than vertical movement."
good,"steady work, ok pay with great benefits. ...NOT a fun place to work. Management is very sarcastic and difficult to deal with here. They are Micromanagers. There are a lot of good people work here but the culture and work environment that management has created just suck the life out of you! the headquarters is the worst, they built a brand new office in RI it looks like a palace but they run it like a prison."
good,"FM Global is a fair place to work,"
good,"good summer job moving to a paperless system. was required to scan, copy, and shred a room full of documents that dated back to the 1950's in some cases. I thought it was really cool until I realized I was touching documents coated in cigarette tar and mountains of dust. definitely a one-time job."
good,"FM Global has a nice working environment. The it group is always"
good,An extremely corporate environment where a lot of pressure is put on employees to do the best work possible. The employees are generally extremely kind.
good,"This is a great company to work for in terms of benefits and great people, however those in management positions have worked their way up from the very bottom and although they are extremely knowledgeable in the tasks and skills required to get the job done, they fall short in effective management styles that need to be implemented for the success of a total department. "
good,"FM Global was a great place to start in the industry as their training and corporate culture set the bar very high. Advancement is difficult for non-engineers, but not impossible."
good,"Management with no experiance and rude, they hire and promote favorites. Pay is not equally fair for the amount of work requested but again promote favorites instead of hard workers."
good,"FM Global provides all the tools necessary to function efficiently within the company. They are goal oriented, and will provide goal setting for every employee."
good,"Market leader by some distance in commercial property insurance. However, unless you are an engineer, you have a very limited scope of progressing in this company,"
good,"Old school type company. Sort of a boys club. advancement is so-so, depending on your manager. They are not flexible at all about working remotely, even though there is really no reason for it."
good,"As being a long term employee, I really had a good experience with the organization until I was forced into a situation based on reorg that was uncomfortable for me.  Felt like I was being pushed out because of not gelling with new management.  Then became ill so that was added and had issues with trying to get back on board after 30 years.  Feel like it was a no win situation."
good,A good experience but at the same time it was comfortable but not exciting work. If you want a place to settle down this is that kind of company but if you want to be in a fast paced environment this is not it.
good,"A secure work place with many benefits like pension fund and fitness reimbursement, grant for transportation expences, bonus for christmas and 30 days vacation."
good,Everybody is really willing to help each other out and contribute to the company's mission of preventing property loss through innovation
good,"nice new building, laid back environment, friendly people, cafe and large cafeteria "
good,It was a good opportunity to learn a new tool in this company.
good,Great Company as far as product and client service they offer. Good work life balance. Not good with employee growth or development. Internal movement is based heavily upon who you know. Bonus structure is not good.
good,"Smart, hard working, fun people to work with. Bad management driving good people out the door. There are a lot of smart, fun, creative people that come into FM global. It is these same people getting driven out by bad  managers."
good,"FM Global is a good place to work. The company uses cutting edge technology and encourages Management are receptive to feedback from "
good,"Great company and great benefits.  My experianance and opinion on management/advancement is that if you're not a bosses  ""favorite"" you'll get no where no matter how hard you work."
good,"I enjoyed working for FM Global.  "
good,"Job security is amazing, careers are extremely flexible in that you can move across different departments and the company promotes from within. The downside is that the most technical positions (engineering) are field positions where travel can be frequent and wide ranging depending on what area you are assigned to."
good,Working for a such a knowledgeable company has its advantages and disadvantages. Lots to learn from and adapt to but individuals can get lost in the big machine. Advancement depends on the type of manager one has. Not all managers are equipped to coach or mentor so individuals need to take it upon themselves to advance their career.
good,"Everyone at FM is busy, its pretty constant. They are very good at what they do and truly believe in their mission statement. Its a meeting culture there, you usually have at minimum 2 meetings a day. They are trying to drive away from that by turning the IS department into an Agile space. Its New, Its innovative and very much the way of the future. The open floor plan isn't productive for everyone but absolutely promotes team work. They are accommodating when it comes to family/personal time. Overall its a really great place to work."
good,A day at work can change from day to day in that there are daily jobs as well as weekly and monthly jobs that must be done. It is a highly diversified company where you are interacting with people within the companies in addition to external companies and required government reporting. This is a global company and there was always new things to learn. I enjoyed working for them where we all worked as a team.
good,"Heures de travail flexibles, salaire très compétitif, bon esprit d'équipe."
good,"A typical week would involve two or three site visits. There was always an opportunity to tour a new location, meet new people and work through a new challenge."
good,This was a contract position.  I was the Administrative Assistant to the Enterprise Learning Group. I would be proud to work here.  I worked in the Enterprise Learning Group.  I learned that I can take on more than what I think I can handle.  My manager was great and a wonderful mentor.
good,"Was a good company when I was there, however they had a bad habit of undercutting industry averages for salary which would lead to massive vacuum when the economy got better.  Lesson was learned and supposedly they do not practice this anymore. Would go back if the opportunity arose, many smart, talented people."
good,Great company with great benefits. Would recommend working for to anyone.  Company does great thing for the community also.  Big with the United Way.  Gives back to its people.
good,"Competitive and yet relaxed work environment with well-defined team goals. Teams work more independently than collaboratively; however there are opportunities for individuals to contribute to team efforts. Overall culture provides opportunity to innovate and contribute to process change. "
good,"Great place to work for anyone that's a loner and loves the open road"
good,85 - 95%  travel for Equipment Hazards Engineers. Management is supportive and co-workers work well together.
good,Worked with a fine group of attorneys on electronic discovery and corporate litigation matters
good,"Great company to work for. Unfortunately, not all locations are the same and I wasn't fortunate enough to work at a well balanced environment.  Very competitive, toxic employees, and excessive micromanagement.  If you like this line of business, I highly recommend the company because its benefits and career advancement.  Good school for the business itself.  However, the workplace environment is poor and hard to work with."
good,"Consultant engineers perform field work that is very complex. Company car and tablet are provided. Training, both in classroom and in the field is extremely detailed. Expectations are very high."
good,"wherever you work we should make all efforts for the company and do hard work always. place is not an big issue if we have an facilities we should better to relocate any where. the hardest part of the job is when we do work stress if we not get an incentives we should not concentrate on work. we enjoy only work if we work hard for the company it will growing up, that is the big enjoy part."
good,"I worked for six account managers doing a variety of jobs. I learned the basics of commercial insurance and always improving on my skills. Management was fair and responsive to ideas and ways to do my job more efficient, Co-workers were supportive and fun to work with. I really did not experience any difficult situations or jobs that I could not complete in a timely manner. I enjoyed going to work everyday and working for FM Global was an excellent experience."
good,"Best of both worlds, the experience and prestige of an old company and the innovation and energy found usually found in young start-ups."
good,Good place to work for someone who is willing to work hard and is looking for a stable company that has a long history of success in the commercial property insurance industry.
good,Really nice place to work
good,"I recently got let go last week due to the lack of work flow. I was hired as a Contingent worker, temping through an Agency and was hoping to be hired as a permanent employee. I really like the culture of the company and got to build good rapports with my co-workers there. I took no days off, worked while I was really sick, and always get my work done with little supervision. I was also tech savvy so I was always helpful whenever my peers needed it and sometimes did more work than what I was actually assigned to. I am an over achiever. Sadly, I was not chosen for the position I've been working in. I've applied and was not even asked to be interviewed. Instead, they chose an internal employee and just told me they were sorry."
good,The Company environment has likely changed often in the over 15 years that I have been away from this job for my review to be worthwhile.  My summary is likely not helpful.
good,Excellent management everyone gets treated equal and there are many ways to grow within the company and you can expand to a different department with help of management. There are great benefits offered as well.

Also, 401k contributions are matched dollar-for-dollar up to 6%."
good,"La empresa cuenta con un excelente ambiente laboral y gran trabajo en equipo, la distancia de poder era muy pequeña y eso ayudaba a la facilidad de comunicar problemas o propuestas para mejoras."
good,"Having worked for FM Global for 18+ years, I have enjoyed the professional carer challenges and working with colleagues to produce quality products. There is currently a transformation to Agile software development and other innovative precesses to enhance teamwork and time to market for both internal and external clients"
good,"This company has excellent benefits, including a Fitness Center on site in The Johnston & Norwood offices. An employee cafe is also available for less than street prices and excellent staff & food. This company strives to keep it's employees informed of the company's status and achievements, welcomes new ideas from every employee, and has a reimbursement program for continuing education if the department manager approves."
