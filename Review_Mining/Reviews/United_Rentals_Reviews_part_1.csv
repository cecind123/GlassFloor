rating,review
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
bad,"Horrible work environment,  no flexibility with schedule and very poor work/life balance.  Management is poor with little support.  Lack of advancement and company morale is horrible."
bad,This is a terrible company to work for all they care about is profit safety comes third they will backstab you anyway they can and leave you out fend for yourself managers usually manage more than one branch and never have time for employees when you do see them which is maybe once or twice a week if that.
bad,They dangle the promotion carrot in front of your face from the second you start working there. Which may sound great until you get promoted. I went from working 40-50 hours with paid overtime to becoming an OPS manager and working 50-60 hours + on-call 24/7. With no OT!
bad,Long days. No work life balance.  managers have the shortest work day out of the whole staff. Consistently trying to over load trucks but company is not willing to take responsibility for weight ticket.
bad,"Management is willing to lie to obtain their bonus, and when they get caught they blame the hourly employees.  Crooked management, asked to do things that resulted in unsafe equipment being delivered to customers.  I would not reccomend working here."
bad,"Bad management would not train how to do the job,got mad when I didn’t know what to do and start with an attitude cause I was untrained and still would not show me the job"
bad,Was a great place to work. Then they started this Q2 stuff. Making cold calls to try and get customers back. Became a very stressful place to work. Corporate always milling around. I hated what it became.
bad,"never work for this company. you are just a number. they don't care about you. do anything wrong and you are out. I was hurt by them forcing to gloves , was pulled into mechanism , cut finger. So they fired me. nice hey."
bad,"Worked in the job for two weeks when they cleaned shop. I was suppose to have 3 days of training but it turned into 4 hours. No one was interested in providing education or hands on training. As time went along, another manager was hired. A fairly nice older and knowledgeable man that turned into a corporate push over. The problems were from the institution and not the people. The shop guys were very clicky and made it difficult to get anything done if they did not like you. Friends were always getting new positions or promotions. Simply put, if you have trouble fitting in, there will be no space for you. I do not believe many of the people I have worked with are still with the company and I think that says a lot. Inside sales are expected to have a cell phone and laptop, making you on call at any time. Ot can be paid out but frowned on. Salesman were pretty cut throat. Saw some ugliness from other departments and knew about lawsuits. My opinion is you may want to look elsewhere. This company is big, and is concerned about investors. Their strategy is to buy up the competition but this provides a false bottom. Company may seem stronger than it actually is."
bad,"there is no hope for anyone in this company, your coworkers are lazy, disrespectful morons, your supervisors do not help with public relations, the equipment condition is unsatisfactory - don't think you are getting anywhere here."
bad,"Poor employment with no salery icrease thruout employment, not recemended."
bad,"Started out with Neff Rentals, which wasn't a bad company to work for. We were bought by United Rentals and that's when things went down hill. No more profit sharing, lousy raises, cut hours and vacation, etc. The worst part is them blaming you for things you were told to do. Modifying and staging equipment according to contract and then getting blamed for doing the wrong thing even after showing them a picture of the contract."
bad,Poor management and constant turnover.  Not enough employees to do the work.  Long hours with little time off.  Company expects you to be dedicated but don't expect anything in return.
bad,"United was a good company until they started getting all these people in a cubicle suggesting and telling you how to do your job better when they never have or had experience in the rental business or in the service repair. They will cut throat you as you are just a number to the them. Upper management just care about themselves and their  bonuses and will give you very little raises or no raises. They always expect you to do more with less people, their insurance is horrible  and will charge you an armed and leg for it. They always set unrealistic expectations and goals all in order for DM to get a bigger bonus. They are always changing processes"
bad,"Extremely poor management and leadership."
bad,"Management constantly wants you to break the same rules they preach about when in groups.  It takes forever to get simple tools like blocks to support a machine.  They make you work over 16 hrs and lie to corporate about it.  Told me I couldn’t go see my mom with cancer because I was “ all we got for coverage “.  They never staff enough techs to keep up with the work load.  Management cooks the books and makes down machines available to keep “ the numbers” good. They set unrealistic goals to be achieved if you actually follow the company’s standard.  The insurance is great but that’s about the only plus.  This was just my experience at two locations.  If you have true integrity and believe in doing a good job the right way, this may not be the place for you."
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
bad,If you want to completely give up you personal life to a dead end job this is for you! Having to risk your safety for low pay is also a huge thing with this company. Half the time you are just winging it and not following processes. Only reason this company is so profitable is because of the slave wages.
bad,"I loved working for United Rentals, Inc., the people are great, hours are flexible and management is fair. I was always busy, made the day go by, sometimes too busy to complete my daily requirements. I loved the work and people."
bad,"Big company with no concern for there employees, Large turnover rate, No room for growth, A joke of a job. Buys out competition and fires there employees. Monopolizing industry."
bad,"I would not not recommend this company . Very top heavy in mid to upper management . The company is very micro-managed. Once the company went public , they shifted their focus from taking care of its employees to worrying about the bottom line."
bad,I overall enjoyed my employment with United Rentals.  The company went through same changes and was changed to Terex Industries.
bad,The United rental near me advertises they are hiring but never hires anyone. Even the manager said he needs to get busy and hire someone but never does.
bad,"Management shows favoritism. they  off good workers and keep workers that are disruptive"
bad,Management makes sure they show how much higher their ranking is. The company expects you to dedicate your life to the company. They punish you when you use your casual days(which they say you have to use all 5 in a year). When work gets slow they look for ways to fire people. A LOT of 2 faced racism. Place is going down the drain slowly because of all of the new strict rules they are starting to enforce.
bad,The company is great to work for and there is a lot of freedom.  The freedom also depends on who you work for but generally its great.  I was told there is a lot of room for movement but so far after 2 years there has not been a position opened locally that is worth it.
bad,My typical work day was working with the accounts.  There was no hard part of the job.  The employees made is comfortable to work there
bad,"United Rentals is a good company to work for,.But the employee turnaround is very high at one branch. Trench branch needs to have some structure, if not the turnaround will keep increasing"
bad,"A typical day of work resulted in breaking company rules so that pieces of equipment could be rented out to customers."
bad,"If you are working for the Credit Department...then you might as well go clean a nasty, dirty, stanky bathroom.  The management is terrible....the job is boring...there are no real incentives...and no real purpose for any job satisfaction.  Again, at least with cleaning a bathroom...you can get some satisfaction that you accomplished something."
bad,"When I first joined this company there was room for growth and the leads were very eager to teach you. However management had no clue on how to run a department, your opinions never mattered and any internal issue was swept under the rug. A typical day was sitting on the phone with end users performing basic troubleshooting. After a while you as a person have to figure out if this is the type of job you want..."
bad,"The management doesn't know how to communicate, they are great at back stabbing. They encourage other members to back stab, They dont have knowledge of creating a good working atmosphere"
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
bad,"I was a yard guy for three years with no help for 2 years.  I asked and pleaded for help yet they bout in a temp instead of a perm associate.  He was limited to his help because of him being temp. They would never give help or assist like i needed. So,  i quit.  I wasn't going to do the job of three people when i only got one check.  The whole operation was very unfair."
bad,The Office personnel start off very friendly until a few weeks has passed. That is when they crank up the bus to run you over.Bad Management and Service. Stay away.
bad,my experience at united rentals was not good i work very hard and dedicated but i got sick at work and the people there left my behind at the hospital i have to find my own way and the next day i have to call for a rive home all do they were inform about my situation
bad,"you had to watch your back everyday. None of the stores was on the same sheet of music. Management could not see eye to eye. Coworkers would stab you in the back every chance they got, it was encouraged. Not having the proper parts and stuff to do the job. Working in the field with the customers"
bad,"Left a great job because the guys at United Rentals dangled the carrot and made it sound all rosy with promises of good pay, benefits that rival school teachers and more family time."
bad,"Good benefits, pay is ok, management is terrible, customers and employees alike are treated like garbage. Rates are high, and the equipment breaks down frequently. Managers come in late and leave early and expect drivers/mechanics to stay all hours of the night. You're never thanked or appreciated for your hard work. Too much of a ""good ol' boys"" club, it's all about who you know there. No room for advancement, good first job, but that's about it. Kind of a dead end place."
bad,I worked for United Rentals for two weeks. The supervisor was the most condescending person I have ever work for.  Stay away from the cash department in Tampa.
bad,"This was the most toxic work environment I have ever had the displeasure of being apart of. Since leaving I can finally breathe again. Do not get sucked in to the lies and false promises. Poor behavior gets rewarded in this company. If you try and talk to HR the response is ""we're sorry this is your interpretation of your employment here"". When 5 people in one branch leave in 2 months you might want to take a look at the company."
bad,Management is driven by fear. I never saw so much incompetence. I worked for their biggest competitor and there is no comparison. My supervisor was so slack he was removed from his position and reassigned to training. Just move the moron around.
bad,Poor management. They do not care about their employees. They are very dog eat dog and lay off good employees who work hard at their jobs. Horrible experience.
bad,"Not a good few months. Very poor office type day to day .....way to many cuss words every 5 seconds  "
bad,"Very poor management at the branch level. There are some good ones out there but you have to get lucky. I learned a lot but you are put in a ""sink or swim"" situation right from the start. If you are weak you will sink, I could guarantee it. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing and collaborating with my co-workers."
bad,"Not a good place to work.  Manager doesn't show up on time, not at all if he tied one on the night before.  He didn't know what he was doing so he continually passed his responsibilities on to others to do and then threw them under the bus when it wasn't right.  Upper management was oblivious to his escapades because they were not much different."
bad,"When I was there, the company was growing through acquisition.  The leadership seemed to be trying to grow then just sell of the company.  It was all about hitting the numbers."
bad,"Company has great benefits but horrible management! Realized within first month I was expected to do everything other than what hired to do upon being hired without compensation adjustment. Management lacks experience and professionalism. First 2 weeks of employment they are friendly, offered perks of free lunch and slowly revealed red flags by requesting me to do tasks I don't even have the knowledge, certificates or experience to complete safely and accurately complete such as mechanics, service and sales even though hired to be a driver."
bad,"Not positive about the entire Baker Corp but will have to say the Pittsburgh,Pa (Aliquippa,Pa) is a miss manged location every office personal needs fired and it don't take much to figure out with all the work going on and Baker in Pittsburgh don't have much to show for,Im sure when United Rentals takes over there will be a big change.. Pat Roksandich"
bad,AT United as long as you do what they say even in most case United knows you are breaking the law but as long as United makes money all is good put have a problem United will dope you proscute and fire so fast you can not believe it and in all case United is never wrong and they pay off to make sure of that.I saw it all first hand
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
bad,"Stay away from Management.  All management is interested in is Sales Force.  Boss told me ""I would rather have a sales guy that his numbers are low but great at Sales force, than I guy that numbers were good but suck at sales force"""
bad,"days are 8 hours unless they need something "
bad,Was with the company for 10 years senior field service technician pumps. Regional certifier. In the beginning this was the greatest place to work. Great people like family. Then they sold to investers and everything changed for the worse upper management had a great disconnect with the common employees.very low morale. A lot of very good people who made Baker what it was began to leave in numbers.management afraid of losing there jobs. They no longer cared about those working for them.went out on a medical leave and was terminatedfor no good reason. 10 years of hard work and tthis is how your treated. Anyone still working there beware they don't care not like family anymore.i suggest keep your options open.
bad,"Open shop, rent equipment, answer phones, reserve equipment for customers, check equipment in, load and unload equipment, clean shop, close shop."
bad,"Preach about how safe and professional this company is. None of it is practiced, at least at this branch. Management is unprofessional, biased, arrogant, and"
bad,employer promises a lot and delivers litte. Scheduled hours that are very family unfriendly. Very little performance feedback and unattainable bonuses are the norm.
bad,"Management are bigots, simple, does not represent Canadian values, openness and acceptance of all peoples no matter race or crid."
bad,"Women are treated as second class employees"
bad,"Horrible local management and regional manager could care less about the time/energy you put in. This job was highly stressful, demanding and I always volunteered and was a team player to the utmost.  This job was always a fire drill. "
bad,"Worse place ive ever worked they still owe me money im amazed they are still in open! The manager that let me go with out cause because I spoke out about saftey eneded up being walked out for watching offesfive things at work on a company asset."
bad,"Terrible management. I would not recommend employment there to anyone. Upper management cares about one thing only and that is there year end bonus at the regular employees expense. You get sick of hearing ""drink the cool aid"" and things will be fine."
bad,"Forget it. Unless there is nowhere else to go I would stay away."
bad,Interviewed at HQ. Made me sit in a chair 6 inches off the floor. Tried to brow beat my past and current salaries out of me. Very unprofessional. Heard the same from other employees who had worked there.
bad,"I have many many feeling towards this company, the feeling that sticks out the.most is their overtime policy. They are so strict on it but willing to send managers wherever they want and allow them to eat or drink whatever they wish. Company is a train wreck they are to big for there own good. Job searcher beware!"
bad,the management there only care abut themselves and no one else they only care about their money and bonuses very racist branch manager at the branch i worked for
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
bad,"The company, despite doing well, seems to be permanently understaffed. As a tech, expect to also be an equipment associate, and whatever else they ask of you. I had to do the unloading, checking in, fueling, inspection, equipment triaging, towing, yard work, full service, loadbanking, washing, paperwork, and finally loading onto another truck to be taken away and somehow that still wasn't enough at only $16/hr. My branch manager was MIA for 2-3 days per week, and when he was there he was buying lunches on the company's dime. Of course, thats fine until they cut all of the shop tech's overtime down to 1 or 2 hours a week indefinitely to make up for the extravagant spending. sales guys love to rent generators out that haven't even been looked at yet and management doesn't care. It becomes your responsibility to make sure the generator is good to go, sometimes with only an hour or so notice. Rules change every day, and managers will harass you to be able to inspect and service generators in less than 18 minutes regardless of how many times you are forced to stop and switch to a new task because of the lack of employees. safety PPE is nonexistent unless corporate management is there and diesel generators and heaters are run in the shop during winter time, sometimes for hours, with the shop doors closed and no ventilation. make sure that if you are told to deviate from the rules you get it in writing, otherwise when it comes back to bite them they will point the finger at you. safety is a concern when it doesn't effect their bottom line."
bad,Stay away at all cost dead end job with no future only management and outside sales exceed nothing but a number here wouldn’t recommend unless you were unemployed
bad,"Worst place I ever worked, Dispatch will always trying to get you to break DOT laws. When ever I had a issue my manager would tell me he don't care and walk off."
bad,A lot of gossip and other shenanigans going on there. I wasn't impressed. Computer system is outdated and they don't have a lot of equipment readily available. It was frustrating.
bad,"Stress levels are through the roof because promises are made with full knowledge that they can't be followed through with. Outside sales persons are trained to disregard logistics and promise the moon daily. Inside sales people have the brunt of all issues laid on them as well as an ever increasing expectation of job duties. "
bad,"Mgmt is first on everything, employees are last when it comes to working as a team  which is sad. They swear at you in front of customers and everything is is just expected from you. They get their vacations first  its a sad company to work for."
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone I know, horrible management think they know everything. More training for Managment,  horrible moral, treat techs like garabge. When things go south mangement points the finger at the workers. Only good thing sometimes got lunches I’m glad I don’t work there anymore. Very un organized branch. U will see slot of turnaround of workers"
bad,"there training is a joke, they have you watch videos and the on hands training is ridiculous, they basically set you up to fail. dispatcher has his favorites and is very vindictive and spiteful. I still believe he has things going on under the table. All he cares about is getting the job done, Tells you to come in after hours and don't log on to electronic logs, has you driving equipment that shouldn't be on the road. you red tag a truck and he still makes you drive it. very poor equipment so outdated and no structure , never been at a work place where they yell at you and belittle you and make you feel terrible."
bad,"No communication also new manager had no clue how to run the place.   If you send emails they go unanswered, but yet they say communication is vital but just don’t ask a question that you need an answer to."
bad,"Had some really nice drivers but that was not worth being treated like an indentured servant"
bad,"Transferred to Houston after 9 years with the company working my way up to corporate team. DIstrict manager gave me a verbal offer and agreed to match my current rate of pay. Despite my request for a SOP offer letter, the DM told me to just trust him After I moved I was told he could not pay me what I was making. Then a month into my time in Houston I was told he could only offer me a dispatch position.  I was given the option to sign a new non compete with my dispatch position or be terminated for not signing. I addressed this with region HR but I was told even though the DM was in the wrong, there was nothing they could do.  Out of integrity and moral reason, I chose to leave.  If the company’s core value consists of integrity, which they claim and train it does ( I should know as I trained several new employees on the seven core values. I was a corporate trainer for them) then they should practice integrity in everything they do and every employee. I left the company with my integrity."
bad,United rentals does not pay OVERTIME!!! They pay on a compressed work week witch means they only pay straight time. No overtime pay. Drivers in the Fort Mcmurry district can make more money working at McDonald's. Heard they might unionize tho witch would be a plus.
bad,"Management says take your time do it safely meanwhile there just throwing more and more calls on you , everyday is a 14 hour day and I'm not kidding dispatch does not care at all for the drivers"
bad,Has the potential to be a great place to start your career under the right management! You have the potential to start from the bottom and move up with company.
bad,I worked for NES Rentals when UR bought them out. The transition was rockey and no one knew what was going on. We were left in the dark on what we were to do. The branch manager wouldn't return our calls or emails about questions we had on how they operate. We were supposed to be a hard down and repair branch but we still ran rentals our of our shop. Then we were told that we are a customer repair and hard down branch but we again still ran rentals. I wouldn't recommen this place to no one.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
bad,They will not stand behind you if something happens with there equipment and gets heart on the job I am going thru it now with them and I’m not very happy with the way they are not telling me anything with what is going on with the case
bad,great money  100 plus hours a week but pit 32 branch is run by branch manager like  boot camp he   wants you to give all like a team but he will throw you under the buss or fire you like an enemy  alot of good employees to work with but management sucks  no leadership
bad,Worst place ever the company cares only about themselves and nothing about their employees!!! Drivers and mechanics are treated like unwanted stepchildren. The pay is way under scale from other places doing the same kind of job the benefits suck!!!
bad,I unfortunately worked for this company and was treated as a number. They closed shops because of poor management and their unwillingness to change
bad,"good company, good service, good people, good experience, good location"
bad,to make sure product was placed on correct trucks and paper work was correct
bad,"It was company first at all times , More so when on call. The dispatch. or leash holder, ( because you were treated worse than a stray dog). While he was calling you on the weekend every hour to send you some other job. While he was in a bar , Could tell by the background noise"
bad,"The inside sales position in Charlotte is awful. Every minute of your day is watched with very little support from management. There is little, if any, focus on developing your skills. The quarterly bonus program that is set so out of reach. The only employees thay attain it are the ones that do not follow the rules and either have not been or management does not care. This department is easily one of the worst managed departments within the company. The managers are never on the floor and seem to spend the majority of their days behind closed doors with each other. The mood amongst the staff is as low as it can be. I would never recommend this position to anyone."
bad,Management does not delegate tasks appropriately. Senior technicians are overpaid and no disciplinary action is taken for technicians that refuse to work. Mentioning that you are going to take classes for anything other than the specific position you are in is grounds for termination.
bad,This company will consistently work employees 14 hour days and they expect it out of you.  There is no work life balance.  It is super clicky and they don't truly care about their employees.
bad,"Stressful situation, unstable, high staff turn over, constant territory changes and reduced hours. Required to make do with less than ideal circumstances"
bad,Three years of service as a Field Mechanic(2 of which I loved) now they bring in outside managers who have no idea what they are doing and bad employees from other companies and when numbers go down it gets blamed on the little guys. Company has lost respect for Family's and personal issues out of their control (including Cancer). No advancement because they are always hiring outside the company.
bad,If you work to hard for this company you will work yourself out of a job. So don't perform more than what is expected of you because if you do you will get taken advantage of.
bad,Management is awful and the home work balance was way upside down. Everybody from the regional manager on up is very cut throat and only worried about themselves and how they look in the company.
bad,"I spent about 9.5 yrs at this company. once was a good place to work,then became to corporate. work atmosphere sucks,decent  benefits and pay though. I  would not recommend  to my enemy."
bad,"Co workers were fine, management wants brown nosers. if your not you will never get anywhere. Very numbers orientated company. management are a different class they treat workers in operations i.e the people who actually do the work like drivers techs ect like lower class citizens. always favour there own people and put people into positions without them having the proper qualifications. my operations manager was a joke. its all in who you know. will never work for a equipment rental company again. they pride themselves in having better customer service, better equipment and better trained employees than the completion and there prices are ridiculous. complete rubbish . Avoid for the time being. no job security they have bought out a lot of smaller companies and have gotten too big now there is a downwards trend and are on there knees with there huge overheads and corporate heavy managers."
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
bad,Another company that is Headquarter up North that uses Florida workers as expendable trash.
bad,"Growing too big too rapidly.  If you want to be treated like just an employee number or a metric on a report , this is the company for you. ARROGANCE."
bad,Constant.  Management is all over the place.  No life balance.  Investors make it tough to implement new ideas because they change them on a weekly basis.  A lot of shady transactions.
bad,management left something to be desired  i don't think they treat there employee in a fair manner  they did not have a good training program the my branch man. wasn't even certified to opt the forklifts so eveytime  we talked about it i knew he had a very little exp about what he was talking about
bad,Scottsdale office destined to close with staff to be offered jobs in North Carolina . Rising interest rates equate to reduced economic viability for company with heavy capital equipment on its balance sheet
bad,"This a company full of talent and empty promises. They almost never promote and often hire upper management with no industry experience. This causes high turnover, and a lot of unappreciated hard workers to either leave, or give up. The pay is on par with other companies, but you have to work crazy hours because it is always a fire drill. The most stressful, unorganized job I have ever had."
bad,"management in most places of branches are not the greatest , the workers are fine but management is another story.They push to get equipment out the door even tho its not ready to go , they expect mechanics to say good to go when its not , then your putting your ticket on the line , there number 1 thing is make as much money as they can whatever the cost may be , be very carefull with them if you work with them ."
bad,"Typical day at work is dealing with everything from composing rentals to billing disputes to organizing and overseeing cross country shipments, all for our largest national accounts. Ive learned everything from customer service to how to manage people and conflict resolution.  In United rentals its about your reputation and   its not what you know its who you know.  Management at the beginning was pretty good, but be aware there is a lot more bad than good with zero accountability.  Most co-workers are great.  Hardest part is doing toxic business, business that is purely bad business, to our own company and our customers due to politics and good ole boy systems that permeate the company.  The most enjoyable part is the co-workers (non management) they see what goes on and can empathize, and are all generally good honest hard working people."
bad,"was there for almost 16 years, our company merged with RSC rentals who had two reps in our area as well as our two. Went on vacation, came back and I was told they didnt need me anymore that there was no longer room for 4 reps in the territory and the numbers didnt work. Even though we had all been making a living for years in the same territory. That was the only reason i was givin for my release, was not even told, nor would they tell me why I was the one that was chosen.Goals were met, budgets hit, no safety violations.Model Employee. No loyalty, your just a number, years of service dont matter. You can be let go at a moments notice without just cause. Then, they wont back thier non compete that you are forced to sign upon being released. It says one thing, they offer you another, take it or leave it. Glad my career no longer includes them. Its definetly not a what you know company, but rather who you know"
bad,The company doesnt care about the employee only about the customer. Employees are reviewed as nothing and customers no matter how insane the customer is
bad,"United Rentals is the largest Rental Supply Company in the Construction Industry.  There's no shortage of constructions sites to call on but it's highly, highly competitive marketplace and United sits on the expensive side of the rental companies.  The job entails getting to site early in the day and in the construction phase and find, identify key decision makers and look to lock up their rental needs and follow up with additional needs as they come up.  So it's a get out early, walk into some pretty gritty locations, sometime unauthorized to gain access to foreman(s), then log everything in Salesforce on your computer, hopefully writing some business.  It can takes months to gain key contacts' trust.  United starts you with a low base salary (can't live on) and the commission structure is hard to comprehend as you often have to discount the rate in order to have a shot at the business but that's where you can make some money.  A frustrating component of the commission is if a customer does not pay their invoice in less than 120 days, the commission earned is deducted from your pay.  And unfortunately, many in the construction business make it a habit of 'floating' bills as they wait for payment themselves.  So it's a painful reality of the industry.  The sales goals are challenging and there's a high demand to learn the construction lingo, safety culture (which most don't adhere to), solutions to their construction obstacles.  Common phrase used in the business is ""drinking from a fire hose"".  It's accurate.   The work life balance is poor in my opinion, as it's hard to get"
bad,This company used to be a great place to work until the president retired and then the vice president. After this everything went down hill. The new managers suck and do not care about the employees. There is extremely high turn over now. No one is happy anymore and the morale stays down.
bad,Summertime was very fast paced winter time slowed right down struggle to find hours to keep everyone busy to get enough hours you would work her in the shop plowing snow doing odd jobs to get a 40 hour week
bad,"They do put family first, or my immediate supervisor put family first. Was able to balance work and home life. Training was good, but the company didn't always follow what they put into policy."
bad,United Rentals has since closed their office here in Clearwater. St my interview they asked if I was a job cost accountant. I replied no and was told they would train me. My position was office manager and I was not comfortable with their plans. I left because of the constant turn over and too much work. I usually was the last one out and had to lock the facility.
bad,United rentals purchased NES last year. NES was a great company. United is a horrible company. Very disorganized and not compassionate about its employees.
bad,The workplace culture is a negative one. The employees are not allowed to engage with each other  which makes for a negative  atmosphere. The management of the branch is not organized and reactive and not proactive. I like my job duties and people I work with.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
bad,"this is a position i held for a short time, and although the post"
bad,"A Manager is not automatically a Leader.  Many other Mangers I worked with were fantastic.  Senior leaders were people that you could not trust.  The Branch Employees are fantastic, hard-working people.  "
bad,"Made some good friends among my coworkers but management doesn't care or worry about the small people that make it all work, only about getting their bonuses."
bad,Not impressed with promised wage short-comings. Poor driver dispatch-communication. Digital dispatch system continually crash. Rushed attitude from management compromises safety.
bad,Nothing else matters to this company. People are expendable and the dollar is all that drives decisions.
bad,It Was a Good company to work for. Good Drivers team We helped each other out. Good pay. Good hours with lots of overtime if you wanted.
bad,Wrong people in the wrong positions! Lack of following through on things that were discussed at interview and time of hire.
bad,"this manager was a complete jerk  he favored employees, he was not fair, he didi not recognize the value in people who knew what they were doing, safety was never a priority"
bad,"I loved my job when I started and honestly still did when I left. My coworkers were amazing people always willing to step in and lend a hand when you needed it, always willing to help you learn something new without making you feel bad for not knowing it. Unfortunately, management was ineffective and created an unpleasant working environment. People who had absolutely no background in what this company does were hired into management positions and made questionable decisions that made work miserable rather than enjoyable."
bad,"Hours of employment where fair time for family given excellent benefits and fellow employees .Gave them everything I had moved about company as asked ,when things got tight they no longer needed me and cut me ."
bad,"Typical day is answering the phones, emails, customer's, job expectations and learning equipment you'll never actually see live."
bad,"to many people in charge, and not going in the right direction, poor management"
bad,"Worked for this company for 16 years. We purchased another rental equipment company who merged with us. Was informed that there would be no sales rep jobs lost due to merger. Came back from vacation and was let go without any warnings, reprimands, write ups etc. Was not givin a reason why I was chosen of the four reps in the territory."
bad,"Management too concerned about the numbers, only because they get huge bonuses yearly. Plus they also have safety meetings daily plus two more safety meetings, one extra weekly and another monthly witch it’ll drive you insane. The salary is poor for all the work they pile on you and expect miracles out of you. Costumers literally trash the equipment and expect it running like new the following day."
bad,business is focused entirely on growth of revenue and not on the happiness of employees or quality of the product. shops are understaffed and disorganized to the point of chaos.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
bad,"Get to work, and start safety meetings. If any other company call to rent something we build or assemble what is needed. I learned pre preparation is helpful when very busy."
bad,Local management is clueless in how to run a contractors based business
bad,"I was on call a lot, made for a lot of stress too. Some of the road techs I worked with were difficult to deal with and would end up doing there own thing. I spent the majority of my day answering calls from customers and scheduling repairs to be done. There was down time, but most of the time it was busy. My coworkers were great, and made the job bearable. "
bad,"Lot's of favoritism and really bad dispatch in SE Houston, the lazy help you get lots of hour's because they park while you work. Service management doesn't even know your job..."
bad,"Good place to start, but no room for advancement"
bad,United Rentals was my first job out of college in April of 2006. It seemed like a great place to work out of college and offered above average wages with room to advance. All was well until I told them that I had to go away for training with the Army Reserves. The Branch Manager told me he would have not hired me had he known I was in the Reserves. He said he would do what he could to see if he could get rid of me. I worked there for five more months before being laid off in late 2006. I was the only sales person laid off and the lay off came two months before I was to leave for training with the Army.
bad,"HR is a nightmare on a power trip , experience not needed as they just want yes men to do as they’re told. Lower management is pretty much handcuffed and can’t make any decisions"
bad,"My first 7-8 years at United Rentals were good. I enjoyed the people I worked with, we had a decent culture, and promoting from within. the last 2-3 years the company changed drastically making the culture and atmosphere very displeasing. People went from a name to a number making sure that the bottom line was all that mattered."
bad,looking for life time carrier where I can grow with the company. I couldn't do it there. I'm at work on time everyday I was with the comp for almost 2 years they put me out at chevron not a clean place to work and not healthy. so I need a comp that I can grow and have a life at.
bad,"Worked for this company for 15 years. No pay raises. I did parts, merchandise, road mechanic and shop mechanic all in one. Wasn’t paid well at all. I’m certified on all aerial lifts ever sold. When asked for a raise they threatened to fire me. I did work with some of the best technicians, and branch manager in the business. They left shortly after I did. Now from interviews with this company I see cut throat and everything I wouldn’t work for with this company."
bad,Overall good place to work. Benefits are great and work evenly distributed amongst employees.
bad,"IT WAS GREAT JOB FOR FIRST 10 AND THEN WENT DOWN AFTER THAT,didn't seem to care about employees any more. I want to work hard wit all the stress,from new companies that were bought from United. Very hard to focus on my job right now"
bad,Okay place to learn if you don't mind being a number. Hard to move on in the industry as they typically tie you up with non-compete employment agreements.
good,Working through the fire season was on call either working at the branch or at my home on the phone and finally got burned out due to lack of time off. Then I took unauthorized time off and they fired me cause of lack of duty.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,"Large company with large goals.  There was no job too small for United Rentals, and there were many high profile jobs that I was part of.  The branch that I was part of was the Power/HVAC, so a typical day was preventive maintenance and repairs of rental equipment.  I have learned how to work on many types of air conditioners, chillers, and diesel generators.  As for management I have learned there are many different styles of management, and I feel that I have taken the best from all the managers and developed a work style from what I have learned.  The hardest part of the job was being proficient in all the different types of equipment.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when we just had a load of equipment delivered to a job and we had to make it work, no plans, no guidance, we as technicians had to figure it out."
good,"Tremendous amount of bias and favoritism by District Manager and Directors. Poor vision, inconsistent standards and expectations with poor accountability and hypocritical double standards by poorly trained District Manager. Poor leadership with too much focus on keeping hourly associates happy, but abusing the salaried management team through fear and intimidation tactics. Little work/life balance. Zero defect and zero tolerance policy double standard for management over hourly associates."
good,"not loyal to employee's, commutation was a problem, didn't know what time you would get off work, had to work extra days at last minute when company was busy or not."
good,Dispatch will tell you what you want and then change there mind and the recruiting will promise you whatever and then when it's time to deliver the location has no idea what is going on.
good,"I gained allot of experience with this job. my job was to make sure all rental equipment was ready to be rented out to customers load and unload all equipment, communicate and show customers how to use equipment."
good,"Management was not trained and provided little to enhance the advancement of employees.  After 19 years, no write ups, no disciplinary action, I was let go.  No reason, but I didn't fit any longer with the new regime."
good,"This position is not for everyone, it's great for some, and not for others. decent benefits, no work life balance. hourly employees have 24 hour cell phones. if you answer and start working on a weekend, you may not be paid for that time"
good,"When I started out in 2009, I loved the company and my co-workers. However, transferring to a different branch was a poor choice. The management of that particular store not only tolerated mistreatment of employees via-a-vie harassment and punitive actions towards whistle blowers.  Corporate choose to look the other way as the branch in question routinely made over $1m/month in sales. Profit allowed them to ignore policy and even safety concerns that led to at least one lawsuit being filed by a former employee after an on the job injury."
good,"A typical day at this place ? Lol! You never know what you are going to get. "
good,"I am in the operating engineers union. it is a good job, but upper management is constantly threatening our jobs.. it's being managed by a much younger generation of people, that does not have any Knowledge in the construction world... the REAL world, if you will...... It is impossible to re-invent ""the Wheel""!......otherwise its a good job... gaining much experience in the New York city area.... it's very challenging driving a 70ft long tractor trailer in these very tight narrow roads..... I've become very confident in doing so...."
good,"I began my tenure with RSC Equipment Rental and loved the job.  I was a customer service representative working various shifts to accommodate the 24/7 environment.  In 2011, RSC was bought by United Rentals.  The company culture at United Rentals is just the opposite of RSC and therefore, was not conducive to employee satisfaction, harmony within the Call Center.  United Rentals was not interested in employee or customer welfare."
good,"Most days and nights were 10 to 12 long. No time to stop for lunch. Had to clock out and eat while driving. Learned trench safety and the applications needed for it. Management wasn't around much. If you didn't go along with the one and only manager you were replaced (famous quote,"" There's 100 guys out there that I can fill your job with""). Co-workers were likable, but high turn-over rate. hardest part of the job was operating second rate equipment, I.E. operating remote control crane without the remote in stationary position against manufacture's procedures and U.R. company policies. Most enjoyable part of the job was traveling though-out Kern seeing different areas like the oilfields, canals, mountain areas, even the Owens Valley."
good,I enjoyed working with coworkers and felt that management was very professional. I had many oppurtunities for advancement and performed what was expected and beyond what the company expected.
good,"Mixed feeling, higher wages could have made the difference."
good,Would recommend for part time work. Great for college students.  I would not necessarily recommend for long term career. Job security is not guaranteed.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,Undervalued as a employee and not compensated for performance. Equipment and customer always considered more important than employee. Loved the job hated how was treated
good,This is a new business for United Rentals in Waste however they have not handled the day to day operations very well.  Lots of turnover and not enough money.
good,There was a high turnover rate in management and on a peer level.  Benefits and salary were decent.  No training in advancement.  Great employees in general.
good,"Started a year prior to the United Rental acquisition. Had made 1ton delivery driver. Then bumped down to the yard. After another year and a half, moved up."
good,not the best place not the worst place but ok pay and benefits are good you get all kinds of titles but not the pay. You are on call all the time they don't like you making over time and will  send you home after so many hours or at least try to cut back on overtime low raises better off getting a step ladder. Managers look out for them selves and sales reps are awesome really great people....
good,"Go go go, but do it safe!! Also don't forget everything you do is on a performance timer/gps, so do it fast. Sometimes rush things too much and then punish us when we make little mistakes. Terrible dispatch, wrong addresses daily, wrong contact info given to drivers. Constantly sending tractor/trailer into areas that it shouldn't be going, no exit/no turn around residential areas when the job could have been done with a small truck. Good to get some experience under your belt and move on to a better place though."
good,"United Rentals is not the worst job to work for but the management teams really need to do a better job at becoming more engaged in the needs of the employees. Upper leadership is very disengaged on the day to day challenges of the team members and overall they have no interest in meeting the needs of the employees. No one ever asks what could be done differently or better to improve moral,  processes or procedures and when the team tries to engage themselves to boost moral we are told we cannot do certain activities because its not allowed (example: birthday club). This company has so much potential and its really a sad shame that the turnover here is so high due to rectifiable issues. This company obviously would rather lose good employees who has been with the company for years opposed to meeting their needs and improving the culture, moral and the overall working environment."
good,"Employees unenthusiastic, very little personal interchange between employees and employees and management."
good,Employees are not considered valued asset. Employees do not have an oppurtunity for input.
good,A normal day is busy and stressful for the department I am in.
good,"Dispatched traffic control drivers as directed by contractors, Super fast passed, close contact w/ co-workers.  "
good,"prefer to not comment on this at the moment. as like many companies, its an up and down job with good and bad days. I have been with worse companies but also have worked for better ones."
good,training for job not the best you have to wait to get training at the in house university . they have great product support from the venders of the equipment so as a tech you can get issues resolved fairly quick
good,"Decent place to work if you want a steady paycheck, I want a career and the opportunity to work harder and earn more.  "
good,"as a driver had to be on call 24\7 was a real bummer, had all hours of the day and night to cover customer needs. learned a lot over the years. the work culture was good . hardest part of the job is the long hours. the most enjoyable part of the job is being out on my own"
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,"The company has a good vision and is always forward looking,   however when the management is tasked to roll out initiatives and their bonuses are based on participation the focus isn't on the benefit of the company or the employees its only on the bonus of management."
good,"Good place to work. Worked there for 5 years. Osha 10 trained ,  CPR trained , confined space trained , plastic fusion joining (fusing trained) telehandler , 5 keys safe driving."
good,A great company to work for. Unfortunately some of the management is real clickish and if your not a good ol boy then you don’t fit in. Got a great review got .25 cents because I transferred outta state for family purposes but came back to being called a traitor!
good,UR is open from 7 am to 5 pm. Safety meetings are at 6 or 630 am and most of the time they are understaffed and you don't leave until closer to 6 PM.  They say there is a work/life balance but most managers are on call all the time.
good,All in all i enjoyed working with the BakerCorp team during my three years. However they were just purchase by United Rental Inc and most of the CORP office is being let go.
good,Not a good fit for me. The operational direction that this company is going is not conducive to being a preferred job for me. Self-service HR/benefits.
good,This job involves taking numerous phone calls from unhappy customer who are in need of immediate repair services. The main function of this position was to dispatch repair technicians to make the repairs. The biggest obstacle and hardest part of this job  was finding technicians to make the repairs due to calling out sick or having work trucks that are constantly breaking down. I did enjoy working with in house technicians and learning about all the equipment.
good,I was given the means to excel at my position with room for growth. Field Service Department was well structured and we were flown around the province and country for training and support; as well as to provide emergency support for other branches.
good,"This position required 100% of skills in all aspects of the Sales, rental and software. High demand and expectation in a constant task changing environment."
good,This was a decent job but very male oriented and hard to move any place other than a secretarial job.  I think that the management  I worked under was very unprofessional and very biased. I would hesitate to work for this company again.
good,"United rentals is number 1 in the rental business for a reason. They have a nice, late model fleet that is usually very well maintained. if you are looking to work in the rental business I would recommend looking at U.R."
good,Its a decent place to work.  There are a lot of safety rules which is a good thing because they want you to return home same way you came to work.  Best part of the job is you get to work with some pretty good people.
good,"The management is great at this job on the branch level.The hardest part of the job is maintaining a calm level head, for example being the shop tech and road tech can be very stressful. The people you work with become a second family to you and you eventually adopt safety culture about them also. This company is not lenient on job progression or promotions and they don't have competitive pay for the responsibilities they put onto you once your hired."
good,the work load was constant the amount of work that was needed to do what needed.The management didn't want to here that more help was needed so we could do the job we were hired for and the store manager changed company police so the store would run.
good,"I believe united is a good company "
good,"execute on previous planned activities, visits to job sites and offices throughout the day. position United as a leader in the market and follow through on the value proposition to every customer. develop deep long lasting relationships with customer to be the single provider for all their rental and sales needs. "
good,They have great people to work with most of the time.  There advancement program needs work.  Typical rental company that is based on keeping the public happy.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,"Good, Bad and Ugly can be seen on a daily basis as to many chiefs have the employees looking over their shoulders and not looking forward.  When individual goals get in the way of good business it affects the performance level of those in the chain of production."
good,"very fast paced place to work and competitive environment."
good,"We are required to make at least 50 outbound calls, plus take all incoming calls.  We reply to emails and faxes as well as send out invoices when customers request them.  Email is on Outlook.  "
good,"typical rental operation, very slow in the winter, avg 60 hours a week in the summer"
good,my company was purchased by UR and it was a good job at first but work quickly tapered off after purchase. wages are good for the area. work was not hard.
good,"For the longest of time United Rentals helped me, being a college student and working was not easy but it assured that I could be a student and still work there. The fact that it changed its dynamic really hurt because I was pushing to make two years in August. Nonetheless I learned a lot."
good,"It was an easy job for me, not too hectic. Management was perfect and I got along quite well with all my co-workers."
good,"Their management team was scatterbrained. One wanted me to be doing one thing another wanted something else so I did what I thought was best. After I had completed the initial task, ~ 6 months, which was for MRO type of products as a secondary offering to increase store sales, I was sent to another store to get their inventory settled, after that was accomplished , they stuck me in sales; that was the beginning of the end."
good,"This is a high speed, numbers driven company that has no problem replacing people if they see fit.  i worked there for 14 year with great performance and was let go for having a slow year."
good,"most likely the best pay in the business, especially in Miami, FL.  Management is a little off the mark when implementing change.  decent place to work."
good,Management would not stoop to the level of people who worked in shop or drivers. They would not go out of their way to learn anyone's name or even take the time to say hello to them. They are a very arrogant company who believed they could choose what clients to do business with.
good,"I worked here for 2.5 years, had alot of conflict with the acting manager, did not get along, he was not a good manager"
good,"The experience of outside sales was rewarding, but management change @ local branch was problematic the workplace culture was cutthroat the hardest part of the job was dealing with lack of management support. The most enjoyable part was working with my customers"
good,"•	Worked with a team of mechanics to maintain a fleet of  65 B train trucks and Trailer "
good,"daily scanning, filing of all invoices. learn the importance of a well kept environment and proper body postioning when lifting 20-50 lb boxes on a daily basic."
good,"Depending on the area your work in it can be very political in the management realm. They pay well but sometimes can put you in a no win situation.  If you find a good niche within the company but careful about moving up.  You may get more than you asked for, or frankly, ""set up"" for failure.  The employees have become disposable there.  Because of it's size people just become replaceable commodities."
good,The company offers many avenues for growth.  Store managers are faced with many competing priorities and lack of staff to make everything happen.  If you enjoy an ever changing environment and high stress levels you will enjoy this job.  The only problem is it can begin to wear on you after time.
good,Company built on hard work and its employees who care about the brand.  Privately owned so it lacks diversity in management and thought.
good,"Job where you must wear many hats. Phones, computers, customers, trucking, loading and unloading outside haulers. Enjoyed staying busy and the people were great to work with."
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,Company is great but branch management to quick to past judgement on employees especially field technician few coworkers are good
good,Company does not offer much room for advancement. Lots of stress from management and constant change in commssiion structure
good,High workload and responsibilities for shop mechanic. Must be able to work in all environments including extreme hot and cold.
good,"Good company, tough to separate home and work life. "
good,"Problem like every big company , you become a number , not about the people that work hard and do good for them they just chew u up and spit u out . When u get poor management that's what happens its about numbers and who can suck up to the managers gets the better positions even if they are loseing the company money funny how that works , not like it use to be when u did good worked hard u move up , but that's gone in big companys , now its back stabing , cut throat , very sad , united has a few good people honest hard working know how it should work but they are not in high positions , I also see if you are to smart , managers in the company don't like that , they don't want you to out do them , its about team work anymore , another sad thing about united."
good,Good compensation and bonus incentives. Overall poor employee morale with a lack of team work.
good,worked for them almost 15 years and got dumped when they merged with rsc.they let a guy who didn't know me or my skill release me.everyone is just a number at this company.
good,"Opening and closing the store, handling money, dispatching trucks, keeping fleet of equipment tracked and in good condition. Hardest part of my job is the ever changing scenarios i am faced with. Most enjoyable part of my day is having several tasks to complete and getting them all done on time"
good,"There was a great group of people I worked with in the beginning. A lot of work and travel involved. However, it was balanced by a great working group that have become good friends after I left."
good,"Over all, the company is good, work hours are long and stress is high. Working on this company will require some weekend sacrifice and commitment, but overall can be worth it with the right management."
good,BakerCorp was a great business model but never seemed to get the right support.  Eventually was bought by United Rentals and think that was the best thing that could have happened.
good,"There is a lot of chasing numbers, so much so that the ideals they preach of providing the best units takes a back seat to putting the unit on rent. The company does preach a lot about safety and will terminate an employee for safety issue, but normally put the low man on the totem pole in charge of enforcing safety policies, which you can imagine how well that works out. When I was going for the job I was promised that every employee in the company was to receive 24hours of training every year and that every store was judged on this, never happened in 3.5 years of being there, in addition when you did get sent to training it often wasn't really applicable to what you were doing. They don't really staff themselves to be able to succeed and some of the old timers will tell you that is a failing, it isn't at all uncommon to hear stories of periods of time 2 people were the only ones there 1 tech and 1 sales person to deal with millions on dollars worth of equipment, and the tech ended up having to work more on the order of 15-20 hour days. They don't effectively track work loads and don't believe it matters, when I was terminated I asked what they thought my work load was and was told they figured it varied ~5-15 units a day, what I was averaging  was 25 units a day with my slowest day being 13 units."
good,Good job and pay  but demanding work schedule and high expectations to deliver on multiple lines of business. You get a company truck and laptop and cellphone.
good,I worked here fir 24 years.I loved my job and did my very best. United took over and changed everything I ever knew. It was a very good place to work.
good,URHT was run into the ground by poor management. The same senior management that would have you do things were less than savory and truly quite sketchy.
good,The job was fast paced with the company workers working together to keep the profit going. The company mechanics were helpful and encouraging to work with.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,"United Rentals and the people who worked there was varied, from incompentetant and unreasonable due to overworked employees and poor management, to excellent and fun management that could be understanding to certain life situations."
good,Over all I learned alot about the different kinds of heavy-duty Equipment and how to conduct myself in a professional matter. A typical day at work consist of me checking in equipment that customers returned after being rented. Repairing equipment and also using my experience in customer service to help customers. I think management could have been better then it was. (No Experience). The hardest part of the job was the extreme wear and tear on your body everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers happy and them telling me that I was a hard worker and thoughtful.
good,Very stressful and put micro management to a new level. They are more concerned about the information you enter into the sales call rather then actually making a good call.
good,"Long hours"
good,"I learned how to run and operate all construction equipment from compressors to reach fork lifts, booms and all heavy equipment."
good,"a typical day at work would consist of using the wash bay to clean hoses and pumps, I used the forklift to move the pumps and or hoses around the shop yard. I sometimes made pick up and drop offs inside of plants."
good,Good company with decent wages and benefits. Good culture and work was usually a pretty good time. There isn't a great opportunity for advancement if you don't start towards the top in the beginning.
good,"The majority of my day was in collections, I did however work with the release department in assisting in providing necessary releases so as to facilitate payment. "
good,Hiring wrong managers to run the company. Felt like working in a sweat shop.
good,"The far majority of technicians only perform rental return inspections which involves very little ""wrench time"". If you can land yourself in a ""major repair"" or ""hard down"" technician position you can find yourself challenged on a more regular basis. At the location I am at there is a limitless amount of work to be done at all times. Overall if you are a technician looking for a full service, fully stocked repair facility to work at I would not recommend. If you are new to the construction equipment repair industry looking to put hands on nearly every kind of construction machine, I would highly recommend."
good,"United prides themselves in being a very diverse company.  They have different divisions specifically for women, vets, and different cultures.  I enjoyed working with my team and women's united."
good,Great company to work for years ago.  Sales territories continue to get smaller and commission pay outs get smaller as company hires more sales rep to increase market penetration.
good,for me it was a great experience to start a career.  fast pace and lots to learn. meet some great people and customers.  the overtime and calls got hard with a family
good,"great place to work, has to be really something you really love to do, "
good,was not a place where team building was an importance.  My division had a strong bond however there were so many other divisions and not strong enough leadership to make them work together as a team.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,United was not to bad to work for not a lot of freedom as a manager to implement your own ideas. very corporate placed to work makes you feel like a number most of the time
good,"Not much room for advancement unless you want to relocate. However, they are constantly hiring young grads and seasoned people to train and place in their outside sales force."
good,"No big picture thinking in some specialty units - lack of work life balance. Corporate culture can be overwhelming, its either drink the kool aid or get out, too much focus on metadata and not enough focus on sales."
good,no comment about this company due to fact they laid me off cause i had to relocate to different city due to natural disaster. i liked working for this company and got plenty of hours
good,"The work was enjoyable.  The hours were good. I was able to expand my knowledge about filtration and pumps. "
good,Decent place to work. Not easy to get advancement. Long hours and being on call nearly every weekend were what turned me off. Management was very supportive.
good,"Fast paced and challenging, large corporate structure. Annual bonus can be good at times. Great systems and IT development and awesome focus on employees and growth of."
good,Lack of guidance and support by direct supervision.  Executive management had little knowledge of field operations.   Everything was measured by the number of incidents that occurred.
good,"Tough to be a woman in that environment"
good,"Overall a good experience. They provide all necessary PPE and have free lunches occasionally. Management is poor. And by that, I mean they have a hard time directing labor to accomplish necessary jobs. A lot of fellow employees have no initiative to clean up behind themselves or act professionally and management doesn't hold them accountable for such."
good,"extremely fast paces, hardly time to think when busy which is often. stress of job began to drain ambition and drive. enjoyed environment in which i worked but day to day became exhasuting."
good,Worked in the office doing accounting and dispatching accruing payables assisting customers. Division closed so had to seek other employment. Was a nice place to work
good,"A lot to learn and they have great benefits. The last manger was not very good but he was part of the buddy system. The hardest part of the job is balancing the amount of work to the amount of time you actually have. The best part of the job was the fast pace! For me anyway, I would get there and look up and the day was gone!"
good,"Typical day started about 6:00.I would check and see what had to be done first as far as taking care of customers that had down equipment.I would call all my tects and see where they were and what they were working on and where,I would order parts and do work orders.I learned a lot in the 20 years I was there.I started as a shop tect.and worked my way up.I have had some of the best management people in the bussiness. The hardest part is dealing with customers who damaged our equipment.People I got to work with was the best part of the job.Most were very helpful and a pleasuer to be around."
good,A typical day at work would be to go out and make daily sales calls to existing and new customers.  Mangement wants to somewhat grow business.  Could be a great place to work
good,Thankfully this company built a lot of bridges for me which lead me to  a better job operating at a plant. The hours were agreeable but they had unreasonable expectations.
good,"It's a good place to go if heavy equipment doesn't bother you. Because there are several different kinds there that need worked on fixed, washed, driving and parked."
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,District managers keep each branch very short staffed to control cost. This puts a big burden on the employees at the branch which in times makes it very difficult
good,"got along great with all employees there. the pay and benefits were great. hardest part was being so busy trying to schedule repairs, it got a little stressful. I was laid off when our biggest customer closed. which made me feel betrayed because they didn't even offer me something somewhere else even in a different position."
good,"My time at United Rentals was only six months near the beginning of its existence.  Pulling acquisitions into United Rental's accounting system was a daunting task. Paying the bills for about three dozen stores was nearly a nightmare. I signed 300 checks a day.  Despite the environment and challenges, it was enjoyable somehow, certainly memorable."
good,Great people to work with. Loved the atmosphere and since of family. Left when the upper management decided to consolidate departments and move mine to Atlanta.
good,"Average job. All depends on your local management. Company holds frequent pizza days and such, so if you have low standards in life, you'll love this place."
good,"United Rentals is a good company. Good pay, good benefits, awesome work environment. fairly busy all day with customers"
good,It is a fair job that has a decent work and life balance. It puts on a lot of stress on the employees because hires the bare minimum to operate at a branch.
good,"Overall United Rentals is a good company to work for, they have a great benefits package and the people there, are great to work with."
good,Day to day operations including filling last minute rentals along with ensuring delivery and pick up of equipment is done in a timely manner.
good,Liked the people in my office but my boss had a god complex and liked to control everything. The office was good and there was always a different campaign being called.
good,Fast paced work environment. Marketing opportunities.Diverse customer base. Multi tasking required. Opportunity to meet new people.
good,Was a good place to work. Good pay and benefits. Great people to work to with. Very family oriented company. A benefit to having use of equipment at no cost was nice.
good,"you stay busy days go by quickly, but no matter how hard you work as their management structure is much too complicated ( too many chiefs not enough Indians) it is way too hard to keep your morale up. they keep everyone on the lower levels feeling as though they are never doing enough. while they never seem to see that there are some real problems within the management.for example when their stock prices start to go down as they have been all year this year they immediately start writing the lowest people on the pole up for every thing they may mistakenly do. It seems that it is always the people who work the hardest fault that they arent doing as well as they think they should. Sunbelt and other industry competition are really hurting them and the only solutions they seem to come up with are to cut the people at the bottom until they can magically make their bottom line look better to the stock holders... turned out to be a typical corporation mentality never felt like i had a secure future there."
good,"On the job training, a school with a trade in construction. Classroom time for one week and one week on the filed learning how to work in a professional journeyman work environment."
good,"Its alright, If it were a local business things would be alot better, then having to deal with corporate, other then that its a nice place to work"
good,"Excellent benefits"
good,I enjoyed the ability to personally manage the rental fleet inventory through new equipment purchases. Working with the customers to ensure the proper piece of equipment was sent to the job site. I was also able to work with every team member at the branch on a one to one basis when needed.
good,A typical day consisted of strategically engaging with decision makers of different contractors and major construction companies so that United Rentals could help them with their needs.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,"Prior to the merger, the people were excellent to work with.  You always felt that your input mattered and was taken into account.  Management took the time to teach you the skills you needed to excel at your job."
good,"Every morning i greeted my clients/customers with breakfast and discussed up coming and current projects which involved my equipment and services. I would then continue seeing as many customers during the day as possible while meeting new customer at he same time. Sometimes we would play golf, see sporting events, fish ect... Take care of the customer bottom line. I learned so much about managing my crews, controlling job sites and how to give the best customer service there is. My co-workers were great! We actually worked together to close deals and get the job done. The hardest part of my experience at BakerCorp was deal with middle management. This one person made it very hard to complete task and impossible to reason with. The best part of my experience at BakerCorp was the high level of general professionalism I learned from my co-worker and upper management. They thought me how to be the best at my job while staring down the face of adversity. I was able to enjoy my customers and create relationships that will last a very long time."
good,Its been so long since I've worked there I couldn't tell you what's its like to work for.
good,good people easy work lot of hours and not much time off no time to spend with family not compensated fairly for the time you put in
good,long hours do not allow enough personal time with family - pay not competitive with other companies
good,to much letting the worker get away with not doing there jobs.
good,fast paced and short tempered.  Employees are not open to new people and are very territorial
good,"I enjoyed working at United Rentals for the first few years. I was in charge of shop operations as well as parts ordering for rental equipment as well as customer repairs, parts and service and maintained a parts inventory.Maintained service records on computer and kept copy of service records in file cabinets.Also was in charge of employee safety and delivery driver logs for company and DOT. Was also trained and certified for forklifts and aerial lifts. Trained and certified company employees as well as customers."
good,A very physical and customer service oriented job. Lots of lay offs due to the economy but not too much turn over.
good,Each Collector has a book of accounts and is maintained on a daily basis for opening an account.
good,"I really enjoyed working with my department. However, my manager is leaving and my future plan here has changed into something I do not agree upon."
good,Daily activities were ever changing based on the demands/request of the customers. Working with an experienced team to meet/exceed expectations.
good,"I learned many new things at United Rentals. The rental business heavily services the contruction industry. UR also caters to Industrial business as well. Have extensive knowledge of the steps of construction, and learned many new safety procedures."
good,I liked there values better as a smaller company as US Rentals before merger.
good,"I cannot offer any disparaging remarks, unfortunately I cannot offer any positive comments either"
good,Great working environment with many positive learning curve. Less job security due to cooperation looking towards saving money and cutting expenses as much as possible
good,"Senior Management is not focused on driving revenue. Economic downturn has sent the company into a tailspin that it will not pull out of until Senior Management decides that the company is going to capitalize and invest in itself for the long haul/ up swing. Longstanding, loyal and highly valuable employees are getting lost in budgeting and cost cutting efforts. Company is focused on cutting cost in order to produce profit."
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,Provided you with a lot of the tools needed to succeed.  Corporate is a bit disconnected from local branches but a strong store manager will help cushion
good,Good place at first to work; then some folks think they own you and you have to put up with them. You want to come in and do your job but even some management there was two faced and condescending.
good,"United Rentals is a seasonal type of business. In my role there was a ton of travel, very little to no planning but lots of coworker support. Benefits package was unparalleled and extremely competitive pay. Overall I found it hard to promote or do inter-company moves as they are in an acquisition stage in their growth and development. It seemed a who did you know policy not a what you can do type scenario."
good,"Entreprise soucieuse de la sécurité de tous"
good,Good place and they let you drive the trucks home. At the time i was there had a lot of knowledge and experience in the shop. super good guys to work with .
good,Great company with too many metrics - not a whole lot of loyalty within the branch level. Territory for salesman is number one - sales management was excellent with extensive training.
good,"Was hired as a truck driver, was expected to do every other job in the company besides drive a truck. Great company to work for except lots of conflicts of interest and wrong job titles."
good,"Provided good career experience, great training program for college recruits.  Locations in every state.  Good benefits, but not much vacation/time off."
good,"Was given numerous job duties outside of original hired position to complete and was never compensated or advanced in position. Told that I was doing exceptional, yet never progressed from doing so"
good,Worked for 3 years. Good Benefits and Pay. Co-workers are helpful. Branch I worked closed down because of 2008 bad economy. Company laid me off and didn't bother to move me to other branch. No job security.
good,"Positive work ethic , gentle work environment. I learned a lot about time management, various applications used for inventory management, patience with complex individuals and I enjoyed working with an amazing team of people."
good,It is a OK place to work. It is a large corporation atmosphere. Benefits are ok. The work hours are good regular work week. Company ideas are always changing.
good,Pretty good place to work at. Met and worked with some of the best people there. The pay is pretty good. They are not allowing sny overtime now. Company vehicles are pretty nice.
good,"The company has a great deal of potential. Our opportunities to grow will very likely increase as the company continues along its charted growth path and trend.  In a few short years the company has grown to a world leader.  However, it would be very beneficial for us to remain vigilant about keep our competitors no closer than their current roles as chasers."
good,"Prepare all calls and objectives per account for the days following.Call on 10-15 accounts per day depending on travel times and look for sales,rentals and safety supply opportunities.There was alot of traveling as some accounts were remote such as miines and construction sites.This job helped to refine some of myweaknesses such as time managementand and also helped to add areas to my strengths in closing,brand awareness and opportunity spotting. My co-workers were supportive and open to discussions but the manager tended to be hands of and hard to relate with.When the long days were done and i could tally up my accomplishments per objectives and saw i ended off ahead of that days plan was the best and most rewarding part to me."
good,The company is still figuring it out.  Better processes and procedures need to be put in place and executed throughout the company.  Once this takes place things will be more productive and effective/efficient.
good,"Very metrics driven company, managers make very poor decisions and very hard to get a decision made, big safety culture, relaxed workplace"
good,"Nice workplace but management support from local District is non existent.  It is all about the numbers.  Hiring process needs work as it takes too long to replace a team member.  I liked working here because I was allowed to run the store as my own.  Downfall is that when you invest a lot of your time to make the numbers it goes without recognition.  Two stores were being combined and they only needed one manager, I was not that person unfortunately."
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,"Busy with rental phone calls."
good,Bakercorp is a growing company locally and international. The working environment is fun and there are a lot of good people that make it happen at Baker.
good,"Treated fair with the exculsion of the lay off. With no previous lack in performance or empoly reviews, I was layed off for no fault of my own."
good,Great venue that I worked at.
good,"Trench Safety - You drive and deliver floor plates (the thick metal plates you drive over that cover ditches), and trench boxes (the equipment they drop in trenches to keep the walls from falling on those who are working deep within). As such you operate an attached flatbed truck with a knuckle boom crane at the back. "
good,Working at United Rentals was a very positive experience and great door in to outside sales and the rental industry. With that said the Large nature of the company has it constantly tripping over itself with way too many people being in charge of a relatively few number of people where who to reach out to in each situation is constantly a struggle.
good,Running assorted metrics to control cost.  Talking with department heads to watch over time cost and head of employee issues.  Walking the lots to ensure safety culture was being followed and no one was in danger of being injured.  Working issues out with customers and working to maintain current customers.  Managing 5 sales reps and supporting them in their efforts.
good,It’s great until it’s not. Perception is king. Very clickish and group like. Lots of behind the back stuff. Pays well but watch your back. Make sure you have a back up plan.
good,"As an OSR I was responsible for an outlined territory located within the greater Los Angeles area. The main duties of this role included calling on open construction sites, prospecting new customers and calling on existing customers. During my time at URI I learned how to efficiently manage time, present professional presentations, negotiate contracts and build relationships to ensure future growth. Among those duties I sharpened my skills interfacing with customers, overcoming rejection, balancing work loads and marketing products and services. The hardest part for me was dealing with internal operations and getting approval from upper management before a deal can be closed. The most enjoyable part was getting to personally know and work with the customer base."
good,This is a good job if you like variety and the challenge of meeting strict deadlines. The Parts/Service manager position had the benefit of dealing with both in-house workers and the general public.
good,"Running around trying to get equipment ready to go out, repair equipment when down."
good,good company  to work  for pretty much dont have much else to say about it do what you have to do and  go home  chances to move up and is pretty secure
good,Good pay.  Constant cold calling.  UR is the most expensive game on the block and 75% of the customers view the construction rental industry as a commodity.  The 25% that don't are customers who are locked up by national account reps.
good,"Like all jobs, it depends on your manager.  I had 3 great ones, and one that made work miserable.   The best part of the job was that it was different every day.  The worst thing was being on-call."
good,"Needed just one day out of the week to start early and get out early which was Thursdays and the Manager refused to work with, this was the main reason I left."
good,"United rentals is all about promotions and knowledge for their employees.The employees were very cared about including the customers complete satisfaction, Making the job very fulfilling"
good,"fast passed and challenging work. You need to be able handle the company ways and need to watch out for yourself. Because the company won't. "
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,"Corporate environment, strategies and overall great customers and sales reps."
good,Learned sales from inside answering phones and taking orders. Generating leads by cold callining. Reached out to lost and dormant accounts. After really learning the sales and the equipment renatal business I was then able to tell new hires how to present themselves to our customers and what knowledge they needed to know to rent and sell our product.
good,It would be a decent job for someone that lives at home still. I will say that the people I work with are great. The work environment is great. They are about safety. Just not enough pay.
good,"Good place to work if you want long hours.  Everyday you learn something new with the equipment. Plenty of hands on training provided, safety driven company you will feel safe at work."
good,"It's a good company except for the store manager being a power ego, self centered, narcissistic moron. He finally got terminated after losing great people. If it wasnt for a non compete agreement being forced upon me, I would most likely still be there. However, I chose to pursue an offer with another company at a lower wage. Instead of being terminated. Inwas not a ""highly compensated "" employee. The non compete should not have been a factor for me."
good,It was a good job to have. They were completely understandably about having to miss work for drs appt.  Very polite to me and the customers that came into the store. Very professional.
good,"Lack of room to advance over years.Very fast-paced environment during summer/fall. Decent benefits after some time with the company. Pay is decent. Room for improvement.,"
good,As a company a great work place.  Great benefits.   Management needs more training and education.  Safety is 100% no questions asked.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a job complete and a happy customer.
good,"A normal day at United Rentals would start at 6:30am and end 5:30-7pm. Throughout the day the management and operations supervisor had inconsistent operation functionality with missing data daily. Management was in and out daily with little room for discussions about activity, unless it was through texts or emails. The work place culture was great and United Rentals Incorporated as a whole was a fantastic company to work for. However, with poor management at the local and district levels, it was hard to get definitive answers to questions that arouse daily and weekly within the operations. Inexperienced employees that were left in charge made the local working environment very stressful and taxing. For the most part, every employee was enjoyable to work with as a team. Only one person within our branch was unable to work as a team member, due to his inexperience, inconsistency, lack of equipment knowledge, and lack of initiative to obtain that knowledge. I really like the culture that the company was trying to convey with the work/life balance. However, due to the minimal workforce for our particular area, made those culturalist ideas for me unobtainable."
good,"Very diverse working enviroment, A representative when the company was Rental Tools & Equipment at the hampton location was a great job, 100% commission, learned alot and still have friends that I see from time to time"
good,Definitely a industry leader in equipment. Excellent business model. Great opportunity.
good,"grew a lot in my accounting skills"
good,I was an aerial equipment technician which enjoyed his job very much. The management and employees were above average to work with.
good,"The company in general is good, with most problems in management."
good,I would help organize paper work. It was fun and very productive. I volunteered here over the summer. I left at the end because it was time for school again.
good,"Bakercorp was a great job for me and allowed me to grow, learn make a more leader and held people accountable for there actions. hired with in and paid well"
good,"Company was great to work for.  They did get too large and grew too fast with buy out of a couple competitors.  If you have the right manager in place, the job was great.  With the wrong manager at the store level or district manager, that made your days long, and very stressful.  Benefits were very good.  Vacation and Sick time were good."
good,Working for United Rentals gave me the experience of processing payroll. The job was challenging and different every day. That's one thing I liked about that position
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,Good culture and place to work overall. Opportunity for advancement from within. Typical day was very fast paced and went by quickly. United Rentals is a leader in the rental industry.
good,"A normal day starts early and ends late. Mandatory working hours past 8 hours per day is normal, as well as mandatory Saturdays as work flow dictates. Management, mechanics and sales people are NEVER caught up. There is always another hill to climb and there are no small victories, the ins and outs of the day to day work experience just blend together into one never ending loop. Each day is much like the next whether in the shop or in the field. There is a tendency to never be able to complete assigned tasks due to being pulled off of one job for another, which leads to mistakes happening and jobs having to be finished by technicians who did not start the job. All in all United Rentals is a GREAT company with comprehensive benefits, great compensation, stability and a fantastic support network inside of the company. My individual experience is based more on the branch that I worked at."
good,Overall good company to work for but certain individuals made work and home life impossible to balance with a 24/7 on call requirement (not a company requirement but locally expected)
good,"Great place to work, 7 on 7 off, great co-workers, everyone gets along with everyone, they are willing to train you, very reasonable management, willing to work with your family schedule"
good,"Excellent Educational Programs, Somewhat Shared Industry Knowledge.  Portions of the Salesperson remuneration package were subject to variables our of the Salesperson's control"
good,"Learned how to manage and grow existing accounts, locate and close new accounts as well as cross sell customers to help their problems and find a solution."
good,"your practically on call 24/7 even on schedule days off. The amount of money that you can make is quiet endless, but it can be extremely hard on family if you have a wife and children because their is no way to know what state and for how long you will be their tomorrow"
good,Solid Company and a great place to learn and grow. Provide a structured learning environment through their training portal. Focus on person and professional growth.
good,"This is a very busy company.  Rental on sites, selling of equipment and servicing customers fill day.  Plenty of reporting daily in Salesforce. Nice having a company vehicle."
good,I learned a lot from this company and got to take a lot of life lessons and professional experience with me. They gave me opportunities to advance and learn more.
good,"J'ai travaillé pendant 5 ans 1/2  chez Bakercorp. J'ai commencé par le poste d'Inside sales representative et fini par le poste d'Office Manager. Un groupe dynamique avec une activité innovante. L'esprit d'équipe et le sens du service clients sont les priorités de l'entreprise. Il y règne une très bonne ambiance. Le matériel Bakercorp loue est quasi-neuf et très apprécié des clients. En ce qui concerne le management, il faut être autonome et savoir s'auto-gérer. Les possiblités d'évolution sont réduites ; ce qui a déclenché mon départ."
good,"United Rentals provided a unique line of work in the Trench Safety Division. "
good,Great place to work.  Company is focused on customer relations and employee relationships.  It does seem that the farther your branch is from the regional hubs there is less opportunity for advancement.
good,"deliver and pick-up construction equipment in DFW area "
good,"good place to work, fast pace but easy going. steady work. no much weekend work, vacation policy is no appealing. easy to relocate. managers easy to get along with."
good,Good experience gained here.  The rate of turnover for sales reps is very high which can leave you feeling a bit like just a number.   Too much pressure put on managers
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,Nice place to work but don't let mechanics work on anything like I want to. Not what I was looking for in a mechanics position.
good,"there is not a lot of room for advancement."
good,This job was a true joy and learning experience. The ability as a woman to go into the construction industry and learn what prior had been a male dominated industry. Gained a life time of friends and relationships.
good,"good company to work for with many opportunities.  good earning ability.  very safety focused.  only downside is that company has lost sight, in the last 5-7 years, of placing quality people in key leadership roles.  management at the individual branch level is held accountable but not given the authority to make decisions.  sole focus is ONLY on keeping the share holders happy.  very unfortunate.......most employees are just a number now."
good,"I typically spent my days handling invoicing and collections.  I learned how to function in an industry-specific, DOS-based computer program."
good,"Learned to manage many different personalities. Learned to deal with customers during stressful situations. Encouraged employees to strive for more productive days. The hardest part of the job was being on-call 24/7, even on while on vacation. Dealing with different personalities. Most enjoyable part of the job, was working with team members, and building relationships with my customers."
good,"Being able to work on a daily basis in order to achieve monthly budgets.Getting around to visit customerss and make new ones."
good,It was a fun place to work. The company was very safety conscious and cared for their employee's health. The people I worked with were fun and enjoyable to work along side. The only down side to the company was it was a large corporation and you were considered a number not a name.
good,I really enjoyed United and my branch manager was exceptional. He went above and beyond to help employees be successful and really cared about their well being.
good,"Responsible for Rentals, used equipment sales, new accounts, maintaining existing accounts, jobsite visits, office visits."
good,"National Pump and Compressor recently got bought out by United Rentals.  Currently we are going through a transition.  As a 10 hour day might seem long, it passes by fast here. With a great crew and good management, it's a pleasure to be a part of such organization."
good,UR is a great company that is constantly growing.Would recommend this place to fresh graduates.
good,"I learned a lot of the skills I have at UR.  Good company, I loved my job."
good,The day is fast paced.There is alot of customer inter-action.The company provides a pathway to career advancement.
good,United Rentals has become the world’s largest equipment rental provider in the world. Very busy office with an extraordinary staff was a very interesting place to work at.  Great place to learn how to handle multiple lines and also how to work under pressure and  accomplishing every daily task.  It was my work under pressure school.  The hardest part it was that only worked part time and I left United Rental looking for a full time job.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,Learned a numerous amount about the rental industry Very good company to work for.
good,"Good company to work for, good team atmosphere. Management is very good and opportunity for advancement."
good,"fast pace ,learn to multitask with some heavy lifting involved ,but completing a task was the fun part"
good,Typical day consisted of dispatching drivers for deliveries in the tri-state area.  Writing contracts for upcoming jobs.  Taking rental orders by phone.  Doing site surveys for jobs and present pricing. Inventory control.
good,Little to say about the company. Offered good benefits and pay. Little managment involvement.
good,I enjoyed working with different facilities via telephone and processing orders
good,"Calling on customers,Office and job sites to provide solutions for there needs.Great co-workers.Doing major installs when a new customer used our product and you are the one to make sure all goes well.Very satisfying to complete job and customer is happy."
good,Micro-Managed! No support from upper management company overall was enhanced with good benefits.
good,"I worked there for almost 5 years as an outside sales rep. I would wake up and get in my computer and map out the day. made about 25 job site calls per day. covered a territory that was about 150 square miles. My boss wanted me on the first job site by7am and leave the last one at 5pm. That made for 12 hour days if you include travel time. Ended up getting burnt out with the company, mainly because of my BM. Lots of good people here though."
good,Over all it was interesting work
good,"My company was bought out by UR. The company culture seemed great at the beginning, but you have to live and breathe UR in order to make it. Every position is a sales position. Management expected you to know everything and rarely shared information."
good,"A typical work day includes driving to accounts and jobsites within assigned territory.  Taking orders and prospecting new customers. Negotiating rental rates, coordinating delivery and pick up of equipment. researching future prospects/project, entering information into salesforce.com.   "
good,United is the largest company of its type in the world and because of that the people on the street bringing in business are overlooked.  They have a what have you done for me lately attitude with little to no recognition.
good,Collections department was well managed. Goals made clear. Expectations are clear. I enjoyed working at United Rentals. They relocated from my hometown.
good,I have worked in collections from standard accounts to National accounts.  I have been in the role of special billing specialist which entails billing and collections from our large customers.
good,"Fixed rental equipment."
good,"Fast paced environment, knowledgable on equipment rentals as well as parts. Heavy flow of purchasing as well as coding and account payables. Customer service was a huge goal at this branch and most employees seemed to go above and beyond to accomodate customers."
good,Good work environment but not of ability to move up. Not a very consistent work load at times it was doing nothing for 40 hours then at other times it was so busy you were workin up to 100 hours in a week
good,"United Rentals is a customer oriented company.   They try to treat their employees with great respect and fairness.   I have enjoyed my employment here, but seek something with more pay."
good,"General slow down in market area .Loss of overtime was to much to bear for paycheck.I liked my Job but there was""nt enough involvement between Management and Staff."
good,"A typical day could be a wide array of tasks. Performing maintenance on all types of Generator and HVAC equipment both in shop and in the field. To installing equipment on event sites, construction sits or various business."
good,Great place to work. Awesome benefits. Strong commitment to safety culture and welcoming company. Company offers bonuses and every week overtime great pay.
good,"it was a good place to work, lots of opportunity for advancement, hard work was recognized and the harder you worked the more I you get paid, very fair commission."
good,Fine for an 8-5. Not a bad place to work. A little micro managerial with unnecessary meetings constantly. Not much room to better yourself unfortunately
good,"Over all it was a good place to work.The employees worked hard to help each other out.We all knew that if the phone rang at 4:30 and the customer needed an emergency piece of equipment,some one had to take it. Sometimes there were too many bosses and not enough workers. But in the end someone would come up with a good solution. Drivers started the earliest so loading in low light was sometimes a challenge but with the safety culture in place,we kept the potential of injury to a minimum.In the busy season we all worked long hours. Some times missing the kids sports or school functions.That was probably the hardest part of the job. The best part was to work with a like minded work force."
good,Company downsized and closed the location in Grants Pass so was unable to continue working there. Co-workers and clientele were great. It was fun coming to work everyday.
good,"The work days are very fast pace."
good,working for united rentals has been fun but the routine can get old quick if you are not challenged frequently. the opportunity for advancement is there but expect to work super hard to try and get the next jump in pay.
good,Great place to work if you enjoying wrenching on equipment in the garage. The radio blasting and good people makes it feel like working at home with friends.
good,I had a good time working here. I can't say much about the company because I was initially hired on as a Temp for a relocation project.  the company was relocating from NJ to FL.
good,"I was responsible for calling upon chemical, industrial and power plants as well as contractors and local job sites"
good,Great organization with great people. The business environment was too volatile and hours of operation were sporadic. Overall a good place to work.
good,Working in bad weather is sometimes hard.  The people are very nice to work with. Managers are great.  Very safety oriented company.
good,"professional work place, good hard working people, working there has taught me team work and how to better follow instructions"
good,This was a very fast paced environment.  Especially during the late spring and summer months.  The hours can be very long due to customer demand.  Management got switched around about half way through my employent and could get a little hectic at times. Although this job was very demanding it was a fun place to work and the people there where great people.
good,"Fast pace, consistent inbound sales, assisting management in field service call dispatch. "
good,If you work here you won't be home a lot because the stay short handed and busy all the time so you won't get many days off.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,"A steady work load that keeps you busy, but great for making the day pass by quickly. I enjoyed working with my co-workers we were like a family because we spent so much time together. For the most part I liked the management staff. The hardest part of the job was when you had a client who you knew was having a rough time because of the economy and they had to close their doors. I think the most enjoyable part for me was the coming together of the team to exceed the challenges that were placed before us."
good,"Every day was different. Position taught me alot in relation to financials, budget planning and forecasting as well as people management. Had a somewhat micro manager culture from above with a need of mmediate satisfaction. Best part of my job was my daily interaction with my customers and my great employees.."
good,"Exellent company and salary. Great working with the public and co workers, Was there 15 years, I was motivated to cross train on all positions to increase my value with this company"
good,"A typical day at work consists of selling equipment (writing quotes retrieving specs on varying units), updating accounts receivable, writing up rental contracts, dispatching trucks to be as time efficient as possible, dormant accounts, assisting walk in customers on small unit rentals, etc."
good,"Easy work, good hourly wage, but they'll promise you raises and bonuses that you won't see, this company is way to top heavy,  mangers that have no idea what there doing, and act like there God, it's all about them....get everything in writing."
good,Communication across departments needs improvement but otherwise a good place to work. Management is very hands off which allows for creativity and latitude for individual projects.
good,"I worked in the reservation center in Temple Terrace, FL. It was a standard office working environment but there are some great people there that make the cubical 9 to 5 life worth coming in for. The work its self was never hard just repetitive which could make it a bit dull but there were breaks in the monotony every once in a while in the form of training and group meetings."
good,"Great team with a lot of combined knowledge, fast-paced, strong safety culture. Most difficult part of this job is the management team and lack of company morale."
good,Too much info to list. great work environment. Will elaborate on pros/cons during interview process. Lots of career advancement for those that can relocate
good,Hard work but treated well. All coworkers worked together and had a very positive environment. The culture was friendly and all expectations were clearly laid out.
good,"While UR provides a good work/life balance for an Outside Sales Rep, they're growing too quickly.Operations has been ignored, which adversely affects a Salesperson's ability to reach his/her potential. They're much more focused on national growth than dominating a local market."
good,"United Rentals was/is a fast-moving productive organization.  "
good,"Safety at all cost is almost the mantra. Management skills are hit or miss. Good mobility if you score well on their personality tests."
good,"High paced,stressful, constant juggling of issues, lots of logistical considerations.  Opportunity for advancement is based solely on metro as well as willingness to hold out and participate."
good,people were good to work with. honest and dependable. laid back work place. i learned a few tricks of the trade when it comes to working on the equipment. i was re-certified in heavy equipment operation.
good,For a time I enjoyed working there but I always new I was only going to be working there temporarily. I have a college degree so I didn't intend to do a blue collar job forever. That said they are a great company. Very focused on safety and at the same time they are dedicated to getting the order to the client on time with all the right materials.
good,I was a Temporary Employee and was able to learn many things about the inner workings of a bigger company. I got to work with many people and run errands for my boss almost ever time and I got compensated for my gas.
good,Not enough equipment in rental fleet to take care of rental customers needs.  No desire to sell old equipment and replace with new equipment.  No plan to increase rental fleet to keep up with customer demand.
good,Typical day started at 4am. I drove a big rig flat bed truck. I hauled large and wide load construction equipment. Management was full of personality. The hardest part of the job was meeting all the scheduled times of deliveries. I loved the pay.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,"I did not quit a job, I quit a manager. The manager I had routinely talked out of both sides of his mouth causing infighting between sales and operations. He thought it was funny to get the salespeople fighting among themselves. If it weren't for him, I would still be there."
good,"Good place for a young mechanic to get started, good pay, poor management . There's no room for advancement if you're a mechanic in this company, they have 1 service manager for 4 or 5 stores, a lot of wasteful time because of this"
good,"Great place, preform preventative maintenance on equipment, assist customers, learned to use supply/ equipment catalogs to order replacement parts from companies statewide and internationally and proper purchasing procedures, most enjoyable part was working by myself completing projects."
good,"Everything depends on the local construction industry. If the industry is booming, United Rentals is booming. When the industry slows down, UR slows down. UR mostly consists of Salesmen, mechanics and drivers."
good,"The compensation, benefits and Paid time off  packages offered is good. The work place culture was pleasant. The company has grown at a steady pace and appears to be stable."
good,If right management is in place this company has opportunities.  There are good employees that really want to make a difference.  a lot of areas can improve but the meat is there.
good,"Eventually the mismanagement, excessive overtime, and inability to achieve goals without constantly being told to do shady things will make you hate the rental business. The company as a whole is actually very good. Two weeks paid vacation from the get-go (with the option to buy into a third week after a year with the company), company vehicle (most of the time), company card, computer, phone, and tons of training. All those things were wonderful. Though, they have many areas that could use vast improvement in; but overall it can be a good company to work for. Just make sure that you are willing to sacrifice lots and lots of time for the company, many times without any form of recognition. You will be on the road more than often, and on call all of the time. Your branch will call you in on your off days, even when somebody else is on call. They will never have enough technicians to balance out the work load, because that would involve someone in management losing a bonus. If they only hire two guys instead of four then lower and upper management get bonus' for making a train wreck work. This means that the techs are getting worked to death. Aggreko does the very same thing. My average work week was 65-80 hours. It was common to hit 70 in a normal week. Working late nights and early mornings constantly. Sometimes you even get up over 90 hours; they'll lie to corporate to keep you on the clock to get the job done all the time. My main issues were not with the company as a whole, but all of the ranks in management. Management is an actual joke. They don't actually want for you"
good,"Establishing new rental accounts. Ensuring customer satisfaction while working with all inside, and outside branch staff. Coordinating and track daily equipment pickup’s and returns with the branch, within the district, and with Central Dispatch. Processing rental quotations, reservations, contracts, and invoices in compliance with company policy. Cycle accounts, housekeeping, merchandise sales, service calls, and maintaining knowledge of proper use of all fleet on yard. Branch Safety Champion. Forklift certified, as well as certified to operate scissor lift and boom lifts."
good,"As the foreman for United Rentals my job consist of safety, equipment maintance, operation and employee scheduling and job duities on a daily bases."
good,Could be a better place to work and enjoy if the pay was better and not so demanding on brands that don't sale. Better working conditions and not so demanding on off brands.
good,"Enjoyable workplace with flexible management.  Not a lot of room for advancement, but there were some advancements during my stay with this company."
good,I spent 15 years within the equipment rental industry and for the most part I enjoyed it.
good,with all companies it has its ups and downs. for the most part at our location morale stays high and people get along and work well with each other
good,A typical day at work is fast paced and can be stressful. I learned to multi task and learned how to work with different personalities. The management team is very knowledgeable about the products the company offers. The hardest part of the day job is negotiating to win jobs. The most enjoyable part of the day is talking to the co workers. Co workers are always willing to help.
good,It's a fast paced work flow. But the staff is really lay back and helpful. I enjoy coming to work every day.
good,Good job and good bosses a lot of call outs good money it would of been better but they went out of business
good,I was happy there & thought it was a good place to work untill one guy quit & another got fired & neither one was replaced. Suddenly I was expected to be 3 or 4 places at once to take up the slack. I finally cracked under the stress of try'n to keep the front counter & shop personell happy had to quit myself to keep my sanity. I couldn't even relax during my free time with the thought of bombardment with the next day at work.
good,Company has good benefits. Company tends to do away with positions and will place you in different positions or lay you off.
good,"Working Monday-Friday it is nice to have weekends off. Definitely a busy shop, I have learned a lot about aerial equipment, the mentorship from other techs is always a good thing."
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,High paced construction equipment rental company. Strong benefit package. Advancement opportunities and ability to relocate. Strong customer service attributes recommended .
good,"Good company to work for ,  largest rental company in the world and has alot of growth oppurtunity. Good management team and they like to promote from within."
good,I was working with the company in one state and would reference it as the best job I ever held. It was like a family working together. I moved states and found myself in a disorganized mess of a location where the management constantly changes their minds and make you feel as if you’re job is in jeopardy
good,This is been a great place to build my career I just don't feel that this is end-all-be-all for me these positions are typically glorified lube technician jobs usually the regional and store managers don't understand important the back of the house really is
good,"UR was a good company to work for. In my role, however, I felt isolated from the rest of my group since they were scattered all over the country and in Canada. Community is important to me and it just didn't exist in my role."
good,Customer relationship building as well as negotiations. My work day begin from 6am to 5pm and consists of meeting customers and creating new relationships
good,"Not a bad company to work for. "
good,its a fun place to work. The people are good to work with we all get along and do our jobs. sometimes we do have to go out of state for deliveries and pick ups.
good,start work early  maintain yard do deliveries as long as it takes get back late expected to start early after pulling a very long shift most enjoyable part of job was the co worjers
good,"I enjoyed my two separate stints working for United Rentals. They paid you for every minute that you were on the clock. Unfortunately for me, I was laid off twice because I had the least amount of service time with the company"
good,"Great company. They have quickly became the largest rental company in the world. They buy rental equipment from good suppliers, so they are renting out good equipment. Good pay and a lot of overtime."
good,"The company as a whole is pretty laid back. Being a woman in the industry though, you get swept under the rug and taken for granted a lot of the time. it's like a big fraternity environment. the day-to-day aspect is great, but career goals are really something people pay attention to. The environment is great, but they under-delivered on a lot of things they promised me on the front end. I just didn't care after the fact because of how laid back the environment is."
good,United Rentals is a great company to work for but the stress involved is sometimes overwhelming. The management at the location I worked at was only looking out for them self.  If you have the right management this can be a great company to work for.
good,A really good company to work for. There is a chance for advancement as well as moving to other divisions. I would suggest it to anybody who is interested in the rental business.
good,"It was a good place to work it was slow paced, and no room for advancement.  It was the corporate branch so there was no where to go but relocate to another state.  And my daughter was becoming ill with her seizure disorder, so I have been out of the workforce."
good,Worked here for several years and advanced quickly. Lots of hours required for job leaving little for anything else but depends highly on branch location
good,Was a good place to work would recommend it. Working in williston was a bit of a different experience but the work was great good pay and lots of hours if thats what your looking for
good,"A typical work day would start with a safety awareness meeting, going over hazards, what can be done to prevent them and the importance of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and proper hydration. Being a temp, I usually worked with the mechanics and would provide service on rental equipment, inspecting whether the orders were rental-ready or needed further service. Supervisors and management did a great job in motivating employees and keeping the work ethic strong. The overall work environment was productive and employees respected each-other."
good,I really enjoyed my time being with United Rentals.It was so fun learning construction equipment. The environment is awsome. Everyone is positive and respectful.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,Great company to have worked for before merger. Able to be promoted from within. Competitive salary. Customer focused and strong customer service environment
good,Large company with great benefits. They support their mechanics and send them to updated training. Corporate doesn't help the individual branches.
good,"Some employees not so great to work with at my last location. This was the only location that was like that. I enjoyed the job, until a new employee had started, that cause a lot of problems. Prior to that, it was a great place to work."
good,"Great company to work for if you are in right position. Good commission opportunities for rentals and sales. Being such a large company, management focuses on revenue only and not customer satisfaction. Micro Manages everything."
good,"I started as a Technician 1. Was able to advance quickly. Was a good work environment. Great benefits, great people to work with."
good,Freedom to utilize my extensive relationship building skills. Team player environment. Pleasure to work with my Branch Manager Darcy Vendel and fellow employees..
good,"I decline to comment due to contract obligations. Moving up in the company can be difficult without the someone to mentor you in the correct process, which can change on a dime."
good,The company was great to work at but they came in and closed our credit office down and outsourced us. Learned a lot about collections and customer service while working their.
good,"Always jumping from one phone call to another, one email chain to another.  Continuously learning about different  product lines."
good,"Responsibilities and duties include the following:"
good,Loved it there just wish management would have more backbone sometimes
good,Enjoyed working there. Had a mishap that caused me my job. The job task was some times very difficult being as you are outside most of the time. Over all a great company
good,"United Rentals was a good company to work for, but there was just not much advancement in the future with them."
good,"I loved this job I liked the people and the hours ,I really liked working outdoors"
good,"I came to this with prior mechanical experience but not professionally and my coworkers were great at being there to answer questions and allow me to grow. Not perfect by any means but I do feel valued as a service tech there. While it's always busy, I've never had a hard time getting time off if I needed it."
good,"It was a fast paced environment. I learned very much with that company due to a number of mandatory trainings the managers attended thru out the year. "
good,United Rental position was in a remote area in Northern Alberta. Job was great. Reason for leaving: I was given a great opportunity to take a position with CMAW and work with Trades People and manage a Local Branch in Calgary. I am the Business Agent for Alberta/Saskatchewan.
good,"Generally, a good work place to be.. The atmosphere was positive.....and when you needed help for anything.They responded right away to help. So I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,"United Rentals gave me a chance of a lifetime and I took full advantage of it.  When we really started to grow the branch year over year they would build a team around us with the numbers I would project. Soon it was a reality and we started growing fast. Management is great from top to bottom and they always made sure you’re in an environment that you can excel in. United also has the BEST professionals working for them in each industry we support so that our Sales Reps are on it when speaking with our customers designing these elaborate shoring systems. If I showed United I had the ability to become a Trainer, they helped me become a Certified Trainer for OSHA Classes Competent Person Trench Safety & Confined Space Entry teaching me further how to sell any business thru education to develop the customers’ needs for your services. I even became a Installer for our larger engineered systems so I could identify the problems and issues we encountered with each system making my next install and design better than the last one. We also had the ability to work One on One with Temporary Shoring Design PE's & Structural PE Engineers in House as well as One External Engineer for the field. Gave me a wonderful platform to constantly practice my public speaking skills by Teaching thousands of Individuals about the Laws surrounding Excavation Safety and Confined Space Entry."
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,Great enviroment to work in. Learn something new everyday and co-workers are willing to help. Great benefits. and work/life balance
good,"Very productive work place, provides training in order to perform job duties accordingly.  Management open to listen employee concerns.   Fun workplace."
good,I loved working at United Rentals but they went through a period where they were out-sourcing most of their positions.  I do like working in the rental house field.
good,"A review of United Rentals after not working there for several years is not warranted.  When I was there it was a pleasant place to work, good work atmosphere."
good,"The interview process is long and very informitive on the culture, business family side of UR and its long history. The hours are long and rewarding. UR provides training and keeping current with the equipment market."
good,I wished everything would have worked out with me and United Rentals. Management was a little sketchy but branch manager was knowledgeable experience coworkers we're good shouldn't have never left.
good,"Lots of hours , will get you any parts you need to complete the job , should train management before they put them in place , but very good benefits , and good pay"
good,RSC was a great company to work for prior to being acquired by United Rentals. United came in with a mentality of we are the biggest and service does not matter.
good,Good working environment. Given the technical tools to perform your tasks. Company credit card made travel to book. Company and department meetings were very informative when held quarterly..
good,"Good company with some good employees, Good benefits. They treat there employees well. They have a good group of team members, The training is good and safety is important."
good,"They have good benefits,paid time off, vacation time. Personal days. Upper management is detached from the work force always new made by someone who doesn't know the job."
good,Great versatile position that was discontinued when i resigned.  It is now under a new centralized computer system as well as various tasks were divided up among other employees and via telecommunication with larger offices and corporate offices.  The DOT related portion is now specialized and assigned to one person who is responsible for this specific task for several branches
good,"Fast paced,long hours.good people to work with.the hardest part is getting up at 2am and still working at 9pm.the most enjoyable part,meeting new people,"
good,United Rentals is a great company with a lot of opportunity to advance.  Very structured work environment with strong emphasis on safety.  Days are busy and go quickly.
good,"I worked for URI since 1999."
good,"Each day consisted of building and retaining solid long term customer relationships. I learned throughout my 30 year sales career that this is the foundation in building long term success. "
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for.

good,deliver and pick up rental equipment. I learned customer skills and how to solve problems out in the field. Management is very understanding in very way.

good,"Good culture, good managers.  Not too much oversight.  Able to manage local business as you see fit."
good,"I was an Inside Sales representative that serviced new and exiting customers with their equipment, tool and material needs for their projects. I came into the position knowing next to nothing about the construction industry from a sales perspective. I quickly became a top producer for one of the busiest branches in all of Washington State. I did this by working hard, learning fast by using every available resource I had and with great customer service. "
good,I enjoyed the job but my manager at end was only concerned about himself
good,"Driven and focused management, good benefits at top level which does hinder upward progression and there is little to no movement at the top"
good,"a good company to work for.good benifits,good work enviroment"
good,"A typical day of work involves a high volume of inbound calls from customers wanting to get quotes, place orders or service calls. Some calling to customers to followup with rentals and quotes. The hardest part of the job is being able to handle the high volume of calls and deal with walk-in customers at the same time."
good,I enjoyed the people i worked with. I hated logging in everything on the computer.
good,It was a great company to work for. The hours were steady but the weather was sometimes not good.

good,"Typical day at work: long hours"
good,"Unique Time Period fot United Rentals."
good,Working was there was great. I was able to learn more about heavy equipment and the proper loading and securing of each unit. I was also able to learn the maintenance of the units. The store manager was awesome and the front of the house staff as well. The shop manager was rude and very contradicting with everything he wanted and was described in the job descriptions. He showed a lack of knowledge of computer skills and a lack of respect.
good,Very well organized. Staff and employers were very welcoming. They guided you with any help you needed. Management was very understanding. Felt very excepting
good,"Large company, room for advancement as long as your willing to relocate to advance. Environment is safe, fast pace, fun and  educational place to work."
good,"As an inside sales rep at my specific location I was responsible for much more than someone in my position at a different store. Which I enjoyed for the most part as it made my experience more laid back and more of an opportunity to learn at times. On the other hand, I received no recognition or appreciation for everything that was done from upper management. "
good,"Great company to work for with excellent benefits and room for advancement. Excellent upper management with very open line of communication, very highly motivating"

good,"Over all good place to work, decent management with good pay. They worked with personal days and took good care of their employees. They provided equipment that you needed so you didn't have to go spend money on your own. They provided training and education for employees so they could complete jobs with success. Great company."
good,I enjoyed working for United Rentals because of the local management.  I did not agree with some of the corporate policies but needed to abide by them.  I think this can be said about a lot of the larger corporations.

Its cool having something different everyday to do or deal with as far as equipment. Keeps it interesting and always something new to learn.

good,"build new customers. sell and rent equipment.  visit customer on the job and in the office.  Make quotes and bid jobs.  train labor workers to work on job cites.  Management was great i am still friends with them and other employee i worked with.  Work locations where great and safe.  I started as entry lever person and grew fast.  lost of opportunity.  Hardest part fighting the economy at the time, but loevd all the new jobs and places i visited.  Gave me great experience"
good,Love working at United Rentals. Pay is great. Equipment is well maintained. Management is questionable.Days can be long and you work in the elements alot.
good,This was a good place to work being a corporate business. I mostly answered phones. Management could have been better. Coworkers were fun to work with.
good,"If you are looking for a company to develop professionally and personally this is the place!  With over 880 locations, general rentals,  power, pump, trench, tools and training with superior sales team.  They have a place for you!  Degree required."
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,"Started in Baltimore, MD in a region office and the accounting groups from the regions were centralized in Temple Terrace with the corporate office in Shelton, CN."
good,"United Rentals is a great company to work for, most people quit because of management. In the Baton Rouge/ New Orleans Metro if you are in operations or service you just follow what the salesman say because they are the people who run the locations."
good,The environment at United Rentals in productive and challenging.  Management is very thorough and does their best to be accommodating to their employees.
good,"A Dynamic Organization in an ever-changing and busy Industry."
good,Overall good. decent place to work. I would recommend to anyone for employment.  Good employers. However no benefits.  Apply you wont regret it.

good,"enjoyed the ARFF, at the airport and the security, did not like the long hours.  Learned how to put out fires, if a plane caught on fire"
good,All co-workers grew close to each other and we became a huge extended family.  My most enjoyable part of the job was end of the month employee recognition meetings.  We as a group recognized each other and congratulated the co-workers that achieved the highest performances of the past month.  Management was very understanding and always had our backs.
good,"hours are good"
good,"To be honest, I love working for United Rentals.  My location has a great team of co-workers.  They are people I can trust, and rely on in several areas of my eternal career advancement.  If it were not for them, I would not have successfully advanced into my Heavy Duty apprenticeship.  I would not have had exposure to new challenges with different equipment.  And I would not have been able to sharpen my skills without their support network of training course (in person and on-line)  "
good,"I have enjoyed my time at United Rentals. It is a strong company that trains well and allows for growth. Working for such a large company is both a great advantage and disadvantage. You are apart of a huge team with lots of resources and have all the opportunity you need to get ahead. It is very much a corporate world and doing what is best for the company will be words you live by. You have to be able to let some good ideas go by the wayside and try not to get discouraged when the smart easy decisions aren't made. The benefits are very good; they were better but with the way things are going the medical coverage is reducing and premiums are getting higher, but all and all very good insurance. As an OSR I was fairly happy; branch closures and territory changes is what lead to my eventual departure."
good,Getting the right equipment for the job for the customer. It is ok for a girl to be on the constructin sight with a bunch of guys. Learned large aspects of the contruction field by being on site. Guys treated me like one of them.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,Service Technician
good,"Sold and rented new / used construction equipment and supplies to the construction and industrial sectors in 3 county area. Worked closely with owners, purchasing managers, project managers and job superintendents to discover and meet construction equipment needs. Managed all stages of the bid process from discovering RFPs / RFQs, delivering proposals, final delivery to payment for goods. Managed sales budget of $2.1M. Taught OSHA compliant safety certification courses for forklifts and manned aerial equipment."
good,"The normal day to day at United Rentals was pretty upbeat to say the least. The culture of the center was very team oriented. They conducted quarterly contests, team meetings twice a week, acknowledged birthdays & anniversaries, etc. Management always held a high standard and are always around when needed."
good,They recognize hard work! Great pay! Like working with a second family! Company truly puts employees first. Wish I still worked there! They are taking over the industry!
good,I started as a mechanic and then quickly advanced into the sales side of things. They like to promote with in and had amazing benefits for the employees
good,"United Rentals is a great company to work for. As a field mechanic, be prepared for long hours but they make that clear in the job description. Overall the work environment is positive with an emphasis on safety. Benefits/compensation is top of the line and they treat their employees well."
good,Working for this company was great experience. The customers were always treated with respect and friendly from the time they pulled in the driveway till they left. When they were on the yard there safety was our first priority
good,"I worked 14 years for them.  Great company with great pay and advancement opportunities.  "
good,"Good benefits, awesome people, great culture and management that actually cares. Work, life balance at BakerCorp was outstanding. "
good,"United Rentals is a fantastic company to work for, however the hours are long and the pace is very fast. If you enjoy and can thrive in a fast paced environment, this company is for you. One of best qualities of UR is that even though its  large company its run like everyone is family."
good,The competition between sales Representatives. The base pay wasn't the best and territory size is different in most area's. Store Manager was great and the perks are pretty good.
good,"Wish i still worked there it was a great place to be, however sometimes things dont work out in some cases. Every one who is there very freindly, safe envrionment"
good,I believe overall this is the best rental company to do business with and work for in my opinion.  I think the company has proven itself to be an industry leader for a reason.
good,"Hard work in the elements at times, but a good place where they looked after you.  Dealt with oilfield a lot, so repairs would differ as equipment could be abused in any manner."
good,"All in all a good company to work for, hard to have much life outside of work if you're in a service truck though. Only real downsides are the regular miss communication you get with a company this size."
good,"Was in charge or processing daily requests from branch managers, district managers, VP's. for over 10,000 users.  Created a manual of the AS400 very user friendly and compliant with E&Y Auditing Procedures and SOX"
good,"A great palace to work. The company cared about its employees and was all the time doing things for them such as dinners, lunches, parties, etc.. Everyone worked together to get the job done. Upper management would roll their sleeves up and get dirty with the normal employees just to get the job done."
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."

good,"Great company to work for, intense training, good support from management! Highly recommend!! Good work home balance! Started temp but within 5 months they hired me full-time. Goal oriented so you have to be aware of your stats, but it's like that everywhere. They do offer support to get you to your goals!"
good,"I enjoyed working at United Rentals, but feel my termination was wrongful and based on unsubstantiated allegations.  That being said, there is a good work/life balance and remote work is a possibility."
good,"Great place to work for someone who likes fast paced in the Field and wants to gain knowledge on various types of machines, lots of overtime and all around great place, management definatly has its downs!! way to many Chiefs not enough indians,"
good,good company to work for based upon benefits.  lateral movement within the division - moving to a different division you must apply and attend interview.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of invoice processing, interfacing with A/P personnel, handling requests for certificates of insurance, directing phone or e-mail inquiries to appropriate area and travel arrangements."
good,"Sales driven to accomplish the highest amount of coverage in your designated area. "

good,"If you enjoy outside sales and the construction industry, you will love working their.  The daily freedom is very rewarding, but it is a commission environment, so you will need discipline to succeed their."
good,"I worked here before they bought out RSC and i was an employee of RSC. United Rentals has lots of potential to move up in the company and around if your will to relocate if you so to do. I was relocated from MN to Kansas, everything went very smooth the employees where very nice. I had to relocate back to MN and things went just as smooth as I expected. Both mangers in each location where i worked where better then expected. The training that i have received was very impressive and i have carried with me each and every day and to every job that i have been at."
good,"decent pay, great benefits, tons of vacation time; lost position in corporate merger, a lot of changes made and many of them were not positive for employees"
good,I deliver and pick up a big variety of construction equipment. Pretty easy job for the most part. Management is really cool and understandable. Pay is pretty descent to start out and plenty of over time but it pays off. Always room for advancement if you are willing to relocate other wise you have to wait depending on the size of branch.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for.

good,Loading and unloading Heavy Equipment to job sites or companies
good,"I started with them as a temp for receptionist and then was hired on permanately. My typical day was to answer the phone and direct the calls to the correct dept. or person. I sorted mail and reviewed contracts that my direct supervisor would give me before passing them to the president. I also would do other tasks as assigned by my boss. The part I enjoyed most about that job was getting to interact with my coworkers as well as potential clients whom I greeted when they came in the door."
good,"Face paced, good equipment and never a dull moment. This company really tasks your mental ability."
good,Unfortunatly United Rentals had several cut backs and I was laid off from my position as Lead Administrator. Was a wonderful place to work .

good,Worked with some fun people in a slow paced office. Enjoyed learning about rentals and the construction industry.  The location closed and reopened long after I left so I am not sure how it is today.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."

good,United Rentals is a leader in the industry and a great company to work for. I have been with the company for over fourteen year and have enjoyed my experience.
good,"a typical day consists of assisting customers, repairing equipment, and staging equipment.  I have learned more about hydraulics, electronics, and engines.  I didn't have much experience when I started but feel comfortable now with basic repairs and some advanced work including welding.  The management is composed of some great people but there is something missing.  The people at the store are awesome and great to work with making the stress and multi-tasking bearable most of the time.  The hardest part of the job is constantly getting pulled off one task to another.  Multitasking is part of the job but gets overwhelming at times."
good,I learned a variety of new skills and had good management there. Pretty solid company that values safety and spends lots of money keeping employees safe
good,"7am-6pm standard field hours, with quotes/follow ups/prospective night work involved. Skilled negotiator with customers & internal counterparts a must. Most enjoyable aspect of position is the fundamentals of calling on Construction Project Contractors onsite."
good,"Inside Sales Rep, sales and rental of machinery to customer, dealing with big accounts and company buyers on a daily basis"

good,I like the fact of being safe and know that everyone around me is on the same page time that I had any problems e with safety when working with or around heavy equipment. The only time that I had any problems was with one manager that like being in charge just a little to much. but I know how to follow my chain pf command and was able to work the differences we had work once HR was evolved. And true to there work no recoil once I took the problem to HR.

good,Good idea for a company but sometimes people are'nt who you think they are. All in all a good place to work. Upper manement needs a lot of training on how to be people friendly and not so robotic. Sometimes we have to think outside the box to get things done safely and on time to make customer happy. Current management thinks  we are all robots and must follow robot rules.
good,"United Rentals is one of the best places I have ever had the opportunity to be a part of. For the most part, every employee that I was able to work with was the prime example of team work. The only reason I left was because of the location manager at the time I was there. He came from an acquisition and was not trained in the ways of United Rentals. His lack of knowledge and personal skills were the reasoning for my departure."
good,This job caters to construction workers looking for fast equipment rentals. An inside sales rep assists customers who come into the store but mostly through phone call orders. The most enjoyable part of the day is the employees are nice and fair. The hardest part of the job is it gets slow (slow-paced)  in the afternoon sometimes.
good,United Rentals is a great company with a tremendous level of integrity and corporate social resonsibility.  They support numerous charitable organizations and dedicate time & resources to the communities within wishing they operate.  Class organization.

I recommend this place to anyone if they want to start there career!
good,"Great place to work, the staff is very helpful and friendly. I learned a different industry at Bakercorp and enjoyed my short time there. I would recommend this employer to anyone."
good,BakerCorp was a phenomenal place to work. Working in corporate I was able to receive the benefit of work from home. My workplace environment and co-workers were warm and inviting. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to interact with peers.
good,"Productive, fast paced environment with great benefits, safety culture, competitive compensation.  Delivering top notch service to customers.  Not a very good work/life balance."
good,working with the employees there was a great blessing to me. the management was open and helpful.The notice was not expected but the management was nice about it
good,Working with URI was a wonderful experience.  I would recommend this company to anyone who is established and unafraid of the many lay- offs the company initiates each year. I truly loved going to work and would return to the company now that I understand the culture a little better.
good,"I enjoy going to work. but the management is all about the bottom buck and could care less about if employees are happy, There big on safty when it works for them!!!"
good,I had the opportunity to work for United Rentals Credit Office 586 for 5 years processsing and collection the accounts receivables for a large company. I absolutely loved my job but do to restructing of the company it was decided to close our office along with several other offices. Our office had one of the best management staff who understand family life and other aspects of life. I had the opportunity to communicate with many outside companies working to collect the receivables.
good,A typical day at United Rentals are Long hours working outside on a hot day or a raining day its the samething. Hard work Lifting anywhere from 50 to 100 lbs (I.E Lawn mower to a 90 lbs air jackhammer) There always two yard person working and when one goes to lunch for 1hr your pretty much by yourself doing everything that the hardest parts of the job.
good,United rentals was a fast pace job with great people. The management staff cared for there employees and wants to see them grow with the company. The only problem I had was starting low with the company and it was a struggle to survive with the pay and the area.
good,Great company to work for with great culture.  Leadership provided amble opportunity for personal development and growth while fostering a family environment.
good,"With the leadership team in place and the growth projected. I can honestly not think of another company I would want to get in the trenches for. The opportunities we can present to our customers to be a sole source provider.... almost endless! They will get rid of me, before I decide to ever leave them."
good,BakerCorp is a great place to work with an incredible management team.  Work life balance and truly caring about the employees is great. Senior managers have a great vision for the company and have continued to execute the vision consistently.
good,It was a good place to work. It was fast paced and stressful at times. I could have received some better training. That was an impact in my release from the company I feel.
good,Loved this job...Hated that they laid off 60% of their employees.  I did not want to leave.  Always got forty hours if not more.  Pay and benefits were great
good,Very nice place to work. Management and co workers are nice. I enjoyed the monthly goals.  I was with the company for a long time and I would definitely recommend This company.
good,"Je travaille chez Bakercorp, depuis maintenant 4 mois, je suis totalement conquise par cette société et également par l'équipe qui s'y attache."
good,"Never a dull moment. Always something new and challenging to do. New places to see, and things to fix change daily. Employees work well together, and becomes like an extra family."
good,"United Rentals has prepared me for any sales/customer support job that I am faced with, developing the skills to handle any urgent matter under a small amount of time. The name ""United Rentals"" naturally places a target on your back,(and in most cases a decal on the side of your vehicle) promoting the company as an everyday lifestyle. Because of this huge target, it has helped me build a great deal of discipline and self-accountability at work and in my personal life. Greatest company to start small and grow big."
good,"Nothing but great things to say, boss, and coworkers are awesome, job is fun (messy at times) i love the hours but the pay is not the best. The schedule is great."
good,"This was one of the best companies that I have ever worked for, they were bought out by United Rentals, United is a great company to work for as well they are fair and pay well."
good,I enjoyed working for United Rentals because of the employees and the customers.  The culture was laid back but we knew how to get the job done.  It was very fast paced with many moving parts but the company always strived to give the best service to our customers while at the same time stressed employee safety.
good,"United will provide most of the things you need to do your job.  Boots, clothes, coveralls, jackets, gloves and hats.  There are opportunity's to get training from manufactures."
good,Great co to work for. benefits are Great. and team will work with you when you need help or even take a day off. they pay you more as you advance. Great company.
good,"Excellent company, excellent people."
good,This was a challenging and competitive environment to work in. Fast paced high energy branches with a huge support staff to rely on. Had to keep your finger on the pulse of your customer base on a daily basis as the highly competitive marked  competitors were constantly waiting for their opportunity to get in the door. It was particularly tough during the decline in our economy as rates became more important than customer service to many of our customers
good,"There is a real feel of a no nonsense atmosphere at United Rentals.  It's a professional atmosphere that is still made fun by the friendly management."
good,"This company looked for ways to improve the technology as a whole. While working in payroll, the time keeping & processing went from manual to automated through a web based time keeping system. While working in benefits, the open enrollment & new hires went from a manual process to placing the responsibility on the employee to log in & make their own benefits choices."
good,What I liked the most was taking on a new task or project which I hadn't done before. Most of the time I was alone but sometimes joined by a co-worker to tackle the job
good,Assisted Warranty Admins on entering warranty claims into the Rentalman system & submitting their credits to those claims.
