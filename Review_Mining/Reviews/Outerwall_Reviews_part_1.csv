rating,review
bad,This place will make you and your car overworked and broke. They say they will pay for your vacation days. But you have to work on your days off. Turnover is like ever week or 2 weeks someone quits. Manager is forced by redbox to make sure you dont go 1 mile over and make sure you dont go 1 hour overtime your daily pay. You work way over 50 hours a week but get paid 40 hours.
bad,"They make it sound so good but in reality its not. Its the worst job by far. Ive been screwed over on my pay twice since ive worked for them.... The service tech isa cry baby,  the manager for the routes is a red head who she thinks treating her employees like complete garbage is professional but.in reality stay clear from this job. Redbox is a joke."
bad,I applied  for them and was told there was only a 3 years driving record check in which they didn’t give me the job because I’m 7-10 years I had a 2 speeding tickets . Then once they were running out of reason to not hire me they said it was my criminal check . They have a unfair hiring process and everybody’s not on the same page so you never really know what’s what. I wouldn’t recommend applying here . It’s a waste of time . Idk anybody who hasn’t had a speeding tick in 7-10 years but my 73 year old grandmother . These people are ridiculous. Apply at your own risk of wasted time
bad,"Middle management has to micro-manage their teams, leaving little choice for the field technicians, after going private the role out of the work order system was handle poorly and added additional time."
bad,"Not everyone will show up for weekly meetings because lack of caring. Management was the absolute worse... they are like puppets."
bad,"At first the job was great the lead manager was very well seasoned on the job and the team moral was great ... Made it not so bad to do the unpleasant parts, Then they changed management to a person that was ego powered. NOT for the better. NOT worth the money paid to do the massive amount of work in one day easily a 12 hr day with little to no break. NO days off , no teamwork,"
bad,this was by far the worst job i have ever had in my life. I worked here right out of college. They over work you and under pay you. You basically get paid to lie to customers about their rentals and being over charged and if the company has a glitch and the customer gets charged its your responsibility to figure out how to get the customer off the phone with out offering them any money back just codes for free movies and you couldnt give them more than 10
bad,I liked my job at outerwall communicated with the customers but the managers had no communication with there employees the routes that we ran was not in order and never enough cleaning supplies and managers had nasty personality with there employees they were very disrespectful .The mangers at the man office would come to visit so much I think the just really wanted to take a vacation to new Orleans because every time they came  nothing was getting done i would never work for outerwall again.
bad,"For starters I've never seen a company take so much from it's own employees than this place.. You have to provide YOUR car for work and YOUR GAS plus the wear and tear on your car. You also have to provide a good portion of a 10 X 10 ft ROOM to accommodate all company deliveries and materials which was not disclosed to me at all during the interview process. This company constantly has double standards ..... 1 week a certain rule is applied ...2 months later management forgets about what they enforced and turns the other cheek.  NO MORE BONUS this year after getting one each year I have been there. The customers use this passive aggressive approach to get what they want out of field service personal.....( Standing in back of you not saying anything.demands.not acknowledging you are at work trying to accomplish your tasks.) Getting promoted only involves being an FSR2 making a lousy 2k extra per year plus company vehicle. Management is terrible at communication and uses the my way or the highway antics to get their way. Working for this company is like being a rat escaping from a sinking ship honestly. Management constantly back stabs employees, plays favorites and will always tell you how you can be more like the better employees.Also management plays down the worst possible scenarios.... ie saying ""the bonus in August we were supposed to get wasn't that much anyway."" What I thought could be a decent place to work is nothing more than a joke for a company that will be forgotten soon because they can't own up to their own actions. Working for free  is very real at this company"
bad,"This company is not what it used to be. I started with the company in 2006 - back when it was fresh, it was new and it was vibrant and an all hands on deck attitude. I worked my way up to managing a department."
bad,"Your pay is determined by the number of kiosks assigned to you. The mileage reimbursement was half your pay. They find ways to reduce, reduce, reduce your route by overhiring and kiosk elimination."
bad,"No organization, the work process and communication process does not exist. Tooo many driving miles, always changing direction. Management has no clue. Redbox is hurting financially, they won't admit it, they are trying to become a merchandising company instead of what they are, a media company, there is no future within this company."
bad,"As a field rep your every move is micromanaged!"
bad,not fun anymore
bad,"If you can imagine company that watched your every move while having zero idea what is going on, this is it. The pay is low, upper management will lie to your face, and nearly half of our workplace has left within this past year alone. The insurance benefits are good, otherwise avoid this place at all costs."
bad,"This job sounded like my dream job- I mean, how hard could it be to drive around and put movies in a Redbox?  It's A LOT more than that.  It's supposedly 10 hrs. a day 4 days a week but on Mondays you have to sort through unorganized boxes to find your whole weeks' route and your meeting isn't untill 10am, so you will not get home till well into the evening hours. I was basically told by a co-worker that I had to half-you-know-what the job to get it done in time.  But- if they find out you aren't sticking to their micro-managed Matrix that is impossible to do, you get in trouble.  Their company computer system is horrible- they expect you to take online classes but half the time you can't access them.  Good luck!!"
bad,"I worked for Redbox for a total of four years. Two before Coinstar bought out McDonald's and two years after. The first two years were pretty good. I got paid for what I worked. As a Field Service Technician you are micromanaged to the point of near insanity. Company does not care about you or your Family. You are merely a component, that can easily be replaced. The Managers were insulting. They could belittle and intimidate and you have no recourse.  Don't expect your Managers to care. They don't. You are ""on-call"" from 8am to 9pm. You will be asked to work 12 hours shifts, but only claim 3 hours while everyone else has the weekend off. ""Metrics"" is a term you will hear all the time. Everything is measured to excess. Coinstar is a bean counting Company after all. "
bad,I worked in the tax department and it was one of THE most unprofessional tax deparments that I ever was associated with!!!
bad,I don't work for this company however in trying to apply I noted that they ask what year you graduated High School which is illegal. This is their way of trying to determine your age which is a form of discrimination. Once I saw this I stopped the process and decided that this would not be a company that I would want to even try to work for.
bad,"This company does not value it's employees and only cares about the bottom line numbers. You no longer have a name, you are given a number just like a prisoner."
bad,"Management does not help at all, they are more focused on writing employees up and gossiping about co workers than reaching out and explaining what the person is doing wrong and also showing them the correct way."
bad,I never worked there but I applied for a part time position on here for them.  They emailed me to schedule a phone interview.  When the lady called she had no clue as to what city I was in and then tells me that the job had been filled already.  Complete waste of time.
bad,"I'm like the other FSRII on here, I also gave this company 4.5 years, and I was too thrown under the bus."
bad,"The company has great potential, however management at least at the customer service level was horibble. Every supervisor does things different which confused reps. Bringing in an operations manager that didnt understand the laid back enviromeny alienated many reps also. While they would promote agents that met certain goals the agents that knew every business and were their over 5 years never got promoted or considered. Basically if you can put up with rules not being followed and staying on your sups good side its an ok place to work. I feel that upper management should really get back to focusing on customer service rather than trying to micro manage every second of the day"
bad,"The good about Redbox is that you are on your own 4 days a week, no boss in your face. lately corporate has become more controlling. they want to sit in the office and tell you how to do the work. from what hours to work to what route to drive to get to the machines. it was more fun when you picked up your movies and went about your business without big brother telling you how and when."
bad,Required too much time for job to be completed. 100% rating for my management practice survey and received a Excellence award for 2010. My team respected me and my management style because I always included them in the changing process so they would not feel excluded.
bad,"This was the most micro managed job I have ever had in all my years of working.  You will run your car into the ground although you will be compensated for mileage though.  You are timed from the drive to and from each job. If I knew the requirements and the true reality of this job at the personal interview I would not have not have taken it.  Can't imagine the winters.  Being alone was the best part. "
bad,"I watched the company change from a fun place to work to a place where everyone baqcame a number only. The benifits are still good but that is where the line is drawn. there is no care about work life balance, they claim they care but in the end they could not care at all."
bad,"Wasnt too exciting, just sitting at a desk all day and listening to peoples problems. Fun and rewarding sometimes but usually just the same uneventful calls all day."
bad,"As an FSR II, Your days will not be consistent.  The pay is decent but the benefits are among the best of any company I have been associated with.  Training is weak, weak, weak. Expect to train yourself.  Management will expect you to know your job right away.  I was with the company for 13 months and led my market in performance the last ten months consecutively.  Recognition for a job well done should not be expected."
bad,"After the fiasco of going public and having a BoD to demand profits, redbox is struggling to keep profitable. Sad to say, I miss all the great people who were there. Stressful job with no advancement and poor management."
bad,Call center closed down and we all lost our jobs.  Bought out by Coinstar who already had a call center in Canada.  There still a support team in the US.
bad,"upper management change this job into a night mare... no work life balance.....no advancement.... no job security.... it use to be a a great place to work now its, will i have my job tomorrow? working towo to three positions at once is horrible... .. we use to have good paying bonuses now its pennies."
bad,"The management team sucks...fall out of favor and your out regardless of perdormance. On my team they fired half the supervisors and just reassigned the work. The leaders leave almost monthly. 3 CEO in my time. Horrible work life balance with priorities changing at the drop of a dime. As a supervisor your are responsible for too many markets and kiosk counts are very high.  No assistance "
bad,"I have to be honest by stating first and fore most that I liked my job; I told friends and family that I liked my job, and I truely did.  However I started to resent my job once limitations began being placed on me, even though I assisted in accomplishing so much.  When I finally seperated from Outerwall, about all I was allowed to do with interact with customers and that was it.  If I did anything else, I risked getting fired."
bad,"Outerwall, Inc. could be successful if they only had leadership with vision.  Everyone understands that DVDs are old technology but the company just bagged their digital product.  They are clearly in harvest mode with the business.  Still, I liked the people I worked with and found the operations teams to be very good."
bad,"Redbox provides you with all aspects to do the job correctly. Company Car, Laptop, Expense Card. They have extensive training to help you be successful. The problem is lack of upper management support. You make a mistake, they are quick to cut you down. This is the downside of the job. The most enjoyable part is working with many different people and of course that Redbox is the greatest way to rent a DVD/Game."
bad,"Outerwall provided me an extensive amount of experience, handling different types of scenarios that customers would call for. I learned many skills that would allow me to provide an answer to the caller, though, many tools that would have provided that resolution were not really ever made available to agents, or employees on my level. Work areas are set up to promote multitasking, and navigating the programs is fairly simple as they provide a dual screen workstation. Many of the workers have been there for several years and are knowledgeable when you need an answer, or when management isn't available, which was often. I found my co-workers to be very friendly and built a wonderful work relationship with them. There are many aspects of working at the Pasco location that were negative, though. Many supervisors would not fairly implement company policies, dress code, cell phone use, etc. Some employees would be correct, and others would be allowed to freely break rules. Upper management states they are there to help, and listen, though when it comes time to hold up their end, they are generally pretty threatening and it basically comes down to either getting fired, quitting, or putting up with whatever it is that is happening. "
bad,"Company was a good place to work, but due to the decline of Redbox the long term viability is questionable.  Individual teams worked together well, but walls between divisions made progress slow."
good,"If you like being a mushroom (kept in the dark and fed BS) this is the place for you. ZERO opportunity for advancement, ZERO concern for work life balance, ZERO concern for effects of extensive daily travel."
good,"The company work-life balance is not existing. Long hours, great benefits,  but overall is all about money, they could careless about their employees."
good,"redbox has good benefits and the pay is ok. for the amount of things that we have to know, and do the service techs should get paid a lot more. the job is physically demanding and there is a lot of travel involved. upper management keeps changing. since I have been here the company has downsized three times."
good,I have not learn anything new from this job and there is not any room for advancement.  The hardest part is being notice for your skills and qualifications. The most enjoyable part were the monthly free lunches.
good,"Fast Paced"
good,"Work load was extensive, & not shared to a large degree by immediate Supervisor. Generally good teamwork from my experience. This is a good job if you have:"
good,Redbox has very little job advancement.   I was brought in by some great executives.  When they were displaced it turned into a boring work environment.   The current management does not understand the business in strategy or growth.   It has potential but will never see it due to the management.
good,Redbox is a DVD rental company. I continued my career in maint tech work. Management was tough.
good,"a typical day is spent working hard on legacy technology. "
good,"Co-workers are generally talented people, but company lacks a true strategic direction."
good,"Employees are a great group of people."
good,A plateauing product with little strategy for ongoing success in new digital space. Poor leadership and even worse communication prohibit the company from continuing to grow.
good,"After over two years with this company, I said the wrong thing one time and was let go.  They are very sensitive to outside criticism and will not tolerate folks within the company making negative remarks. At all levels of management there is a strong tendency to micro-manage.  Management uses your cell phone to track you.  You are not given enough time to properly service each kiosk.  The company has parties, dinners, and prizes as a flimsy attempt to make things seem well and good.  From my associations with other Red Box employees, it's generally regarded as a company which will squeeze everything out of you, then let you go.  Oh yes.  Don't forget all the Red Box stuff you have to store in your home."
good,"Was a good job at first, was promised advancement, but was actually never an option. A lot of travel, especially in this area. Can get a bit redundant."
good,You are micro managed at all times and they don't give you enough time to get all the work done that needs to be done. The kiosks are dirty and there is no time to help with customer service.
good,"The company and job in of itself were excellent. Benefits were also very good. The problem in the company lay in its inconsistency of work (hours would vary widely from week to week depending on merchandise) and the fact that the managers practice retaliation on you should you give any manager a low score on ""anonymous"" reviews. Perhaps not all managers throughout the company were like that, but from my experience, they were bullies to me and ended up forcing me out of the job."
good,It is a great place for flexible hours and good benefits. The limited staff makes advancement almost impossible except if your willing to relocate.
good,"I have worked at redbox for 5 years, and in that time, the company has seen tremendous growth. However, the culture has gone from a fun place to work, to one of working until you have no energy left. Depending on the position, late nights can be a norm, and usually it is salaried employees working those hours. Every thing that comes up is a ""fire drill"". Micro-managing is also very common among the departments. The benefits are good; the health, 401(k) and other benefits are nice.You are given a good amount of vacation to start too (3 weeks). Good luck finding time to use it though, it only comes in handy when you want to leave the company and get a nice payout."
good,the most enjoyable part of this company i liked was the dress code.
good,the overall environment was great and the people are very easy to work with though in the field you have very little interaction with the core group of people
good,Good people who want to make a difference works here even with lack of leadership presence. Shows how hard people are willing to work for this organization.
good,Red box was a great experience and I would do a again if I had the opportunity to do something. It was fun and  was great around my schedule I give them a thumb up.
good,A typical day included delivering movies to your designated area.  It usually takes 2-3 days to deliver your movies. The rest of your days are on-call days.
good,"This was a slow paced balanced job with lil or no stress, the pay was not that great, i enjoyed managing the kiosk and i had 48 locations stretching across northe Louisiana and further....."
good,"While at Outerwall, I learned more accounting, treasury and human resource skills. Learning to partner and be inclusive was a key factor to the payroll departments success."
good,Redbox is a growing company that provides many opportunities for individuals to provide immediate impact. I was able to learn and develop many skills necessary to become successful within my career progression.
good,"- Relaxed culture"
good,"Loved the work, small teams. managers were awesome and very supportive."
good,"During the time-frame of my employment; company was growing at an incredible rate. Most training took place on the fly with management having the attitude of ""They will learn as they move along"". Poor communication between upper management in Seattle and local management in Oak Brook, IL."
good,Company has diverse product lines of business from an well-established products to new ventures opportunities.
good,"Long hours, heavy lifting, and company asking more and more from employees, without giving additional compensation.  The mileage compensation is good, but the work is not.  Management was decent at local level, but the upper level does not understand or care about issues at ground zero."
good,"Provided service to customer and store support for multiple lines of business including Coinstar, Redbox and Coinstar exchange. "
good,"Scheduling and attendance policy is a joke. Beware of what is called the ""Shift Bid."" A typical day is constant change and half the time management is unaware of the change. Management is not on the same page as to what quality standards should be, even though there is a guideline. Customers can either be pleasant to work with or  extremely difficult due to lack of resources agents have to work with. "
good,"Many changes... many lay off's.... Good company, good benefits, and nice co- workers. 2 lay office within a year and the company was sold."
good,"The people make the environment bearable. Higher management has issues relating or coming into contact with employees. It's your typical office job or warehouse job mixed in a with a few good daily moments because the people are great. Hardest part of the job is the monotony. The most enjoyable part is getting to know the people working with you. I learned that this is not the place to move up in your career, but a stepping stone for better opportunities. Strides are being made to make the company more profitable and time will tell if this is what the company needs to survive, and if its employees will continue the work and vision started by its creators."
good,Load new movies in kiosks clean inside and out. How to deal with the public. Management is strict but nice they don't bother you with phone calls they just let you do your job. Not a hard job. You get to work alone.
good,"I don't really have anything bad to say about Outerwall. They've gone through some growing pains in their planning and execution, but working here has been a tremendous experience for me. I've learned a great deal while working here and they've helped me grow my skill set. I wouldn't trade my time here for anything."
good,Nice restaurant good facility and equipment good campany  nice work place and co workers nice gest full of surprises good food and drinks very easy to work in this campany
good,When i got hired by this job i thought it was a chance too work for company to start and build a career but i was sadly mistaken. During my phone interview with my manager at the time i was told the territory i was going to work in was going to be a booming market for  the company. Little did i know that during my tenure there which was less than a year that i would be laid off from my position that was supposed to be a promising and expanding market that was told to me by my superiors. I must admit that the company was very generous in the severance package but it still was a unexpected turn of events. I really did enjoy my job and what i did there i wish it would of worked out because i would of stayed with them because i believed in their mission statement.
good,Outerwall offer great opportunity within the technology industry to working professionals.  The company hold many entertainment and fundraising gatherings.
good,"good bartender good jobs handle the guest."
good,"Great company that values work and home balance.  Acquired many skills that I can apply to my career.  Some skills include:"
good,I learned to build up my productivity. To help out my coworkers in need as a team player or a lending hand or ears to listen. Hardest part is maintaining a full table of cases when the coworker does his or her part on the machines.
good,Great opportunity to learn from brilliant business minds with extensive start-up experience. Everyone had an entreprenurial spirit and it was the first time I worked on an IPO.
good,"I load my car with all of the movies and supplies I need for the day, Then begin my route. At each machine, I clean the outside, change the art work. Remove old movies and add new movies. Do any minor maintenance that needs to be done. I need to keep track of what movies get returned and what movies go into each machine."
good,Outdoors work involving commuting and simple computer and vending machine problem solving. Attention to detail a necessity as well as good record keeping. Distributing inventory and returning old / damaged inventory. Current popular movies & games DVDs and Artwork are distributed to vending kiosks.
good,Loved my time at Outerwall. My job was dynamic and diverse. I built a world-class team who could drive a best-in-class Asset protection function in any organization
good,"Redbox is a growing company that eclipsed other DVD rental kiosk business in recent years. Their growth rate, while impressive, has also caused some growing pains within the company. Working for Redbox means being able to handle frequent changes to policy and procedure. They do, however, offer some of the best benefits in the workplace. The hours can be long. The position requires working outdoors frequently, and the employee is exposed to all weather conditions. The labor conditions of the job are moderate, with occasional heavy lifting with frequent bending/kneeling. The ability to work outside a cubicle/desk environment is a bonus. It is essential to have your own working, reliable vehicle that can accommodate large inventory."
good,"the Redbox Culture states the core values are a way of live.... Well the first part of my career at Redbox it was like that but the last year has been exactly the opposite. Email after email states this is how it is to be. But the words coming out of my bosses mouth were just the opposite. Don't wok over time, but if worked you will get paid.(company). I will not authorized any OT but get the route done regardless(boss). see very different. Called HR to complain about hostile work environment and within a month boss finds something to fire me for... Great HR protection that open door policy sucks!"
good,"My duties include collecting movies from machines and recording the count. I keep daily record of the products distributed to each machine. I provide quality customer services through regular interaction and communication with store managers, owners, employees and customers. Other duties include but are not limited to training new personnel.  I regularly communicate the status of each machine and customer accounts with the Regional Office Supervisor. I am also responsible for ensuring that each machine is kept locked when not being serviced."
good,1. logging in work portal and scheduling territory visit.
good,"The company wanted every one to excel. However investors looked at the employees as a cost and after numerous restructuring they let 300 people go in 2013 before Christmas."
good,"Friendly co-workers and understanding management.  Work is monotonous, sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day.  Constantly changing metrics means having to adjust how you work regularly."
good,I enjoy working for redbox. It offers some flexibility but lately the focus has been more on cost cutting and demanding more work in less time.
good,I enjoyed my time there as a route service person.  Consistent work schedule.  Good support by staff and management.  Good co-workers as well.  I would recommend this if you are in the market for this type of work.
good,Flexible schedule to accommodate lifestyle needs is the first thing that stands out at Redbox.  You learn hands on which is great for a lot of people.  As a level 2 you have a company car which is great.  The hardest part of this job is working and driving in all weather conditions.  The most enjoyable part of the job is obviously working in great weather and having flexibility.
good,"Awesome place to work. Redbox provides it's employees with world class benefits. As a technician, I don't have consecutive days off. With a teenager at home, I am seeking to spend weekends with my family."
good,Redbox has great flexibility and freedom.  I see my boss once a week and thats it.  I currently work a 4 day week and have flexibility to do errands in middle of day or kids activities.  Decent job but no room for advancement and pay increases are weak.
good,"Great people, very flexible and casual environment.  Free coffee and snacks, flexibility on time and working remotely.  More P.TO would be nice.  Alot of priority changes.  Not clear direction from upper management."
good,Work life balance was great.  Flexible work environment and great people to work with.  I had the opportunity to work with several groups across the company and without exception the attitude of the people was great.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company.  They have a very inclusive company culture, and work to be a part of the communities that they work in.  The benefits package while I was there was right up there for the industry, and they offered lots of other perks, such as a wellness program.  They have several Business Resource Groups that you can be a part of, that offer many different types of volunteer opportunities, as well as opportunities to develop leadership skills."
good,"Merchandise kiosk throughout the territory, and insure field representatives complete work with a 98.9% accuracy rate. "
good,"Very good company to work for.  They carry some of the best benefits in Arizona, but have really loaded on the work and cut back on the staff.  I believe that this company is working hard to keep up to date on their product (s) with the changes in the industry.  My co-workers are the best team out there to work along side, they really help when needed, go the extra mile to complete any task given, understanding, and make great team mates.  The hardest part of the job is really just working out in the Arizona heat under a time frame given by Corporate back in Illinois. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that you do have the freedom of starting when you want, and for the most part it is like working out of your home, or acting as a sub contractor for the company.  Although the typical day is broken down as to how many kiosks have to be completed by days end and have to be completed in a certain order with a time allotment given to complete each kiosk, the rest is basically repetitious work."
good,Redbox provided me with the opportunity to have a flexable work day so I could balance work and my family.
good,"It is a great company to work for if you like to travel. Great employees with great benefits. "
good,Review of working at Redbox.   High expectations of people but good culture and fair to people.  Allows for flexibility in work schedule to achieve work goals and personal requirements
good,"Fun place to work for, You come in and start fixing kiosks. Learned alot about how the inside of the machine really works. Theirs many ways to fix the different issue that i would see. You get to help the technicians that are physically fixing the machine, We would brainstorm everything possible to make sure the kiosk will be up."
good,"Manage the day to day operations and activities within the Machine Support Call Center for Redbox / OuterWall. Responsible for up to 15 direct reports in such activities as remote technical trouble shooting, internal customer service, project management, coaching, employee development, and call center metrics"
good,my review of redbox would be that they need to stop trying to go outside of the company to aquire other companies and just work with what they have and build on that
good,"Outerwall is a great company to work for creating trend setting consumer offerings.  Powerful brands such as Coinstar, Redbox, and working on launching additional solutions to their brand portfolio.  I would recommend Outerwall as being a great place to work."
good,The position is a good place for people to start straight out of college. However the management was severely flawed. Each supervisor tried to run things differently and would never work out properly.
good,"Redbox is an extremely fast-moving company. Plans and strategies not only change from week-to-week, but sometimes day-to-day. While this can be exciting, it's also not sustainable. Over time, the company has shifted from startup to mature industry-leader. There is a gap between ""old-timers"" who remember the company before it was acquired by Coinstar, the ""newcomers"" who don't have the institutional memories."
good,"Casual attire and free snacks, drinks, video rentals. Wearing sandals and hoodies every day to work. Staff is on the younger side. Great environment to learn more technical things."
good,The best place I have worked. Process is excellent. I was delivering in a weeks time. Very organized and the team I worked with were excellent. I wish I could work there fulltime.
good,Recent acquisition negatively changed culture and leadership. The Outerwall era (2011 -2014) was an amzing time with a very diverse and inclusive culture with high employee engagement
good,"was interesting always busy with different things to do."
good,Great place to work with a good work/life balance. The managers are aware of everybody's needs and wants and work to accommodate you as best as possible.
good,"It can quite hectic but when I worked there I like the freedom and personal schedule. It allowed me to live on the schedule I liked and as long as the work got done by the end of the week, then my bosses were happy."
good,"9 years working with Redbox was fun, it is nice to have a job and career that you enjoy. Working in the retail entertainment business was very rewarding."
good,"Co-workers and management was great, we went on a company trip to Las Vegas."
good,Over this company is a great place to work and advance in your career path. When I stared with the Rubi coffee division it was a fantastic exciting start up with an excellent management staff.
good,"I really enjoyed the job. Management was the best. But you'll add tons of miles to your car and to sacrifice space in your house for product. I was driving 500+ miles a week (4 day route) for work. That's a lot of wear and tear on a car. Yes they pay you gas miles (somewhere around .15 - .25 a mile), and some extra for the wear and tear on the car, but it's still a lot on the vehicle. You will also need to sacrifice space in your house to store your product for the week (inbound and outbound product). If you don't have a garage, or live in a smaller home, this could cause problems. "

The hardest part of this job is having to work outside in the extremes of the weather, however, this isn't a big issue as there are only a couple of months of the year where it is unpleasant.

The company currently was sold so security of a job position is unsure as of now.   I would go back to work there in a minute if anything came available and I knew it was going to be long term."

good,"Although I was laid off due to my market merging with another market that was managed by a ROS with 5 years more tenure, I have nothing but positive comments regarding my experience.  I was given great support from start to finish from our corporate office and my immediate management.  I took a market that had issues with poor culture(in-fighting, insubordination, cliques, etc) and turned it around completely.  Not only did I lead the team together, but we began working together in community and volunteer events as well as 5Ks in support of our Wellness Program.  Our production increased and our metrics in 2013 finished at the Exceptional level.  My Regional Manager was very supportive in my efforts and helped me make the right decisions.  He was thankful and praised me for doing the extra work.   "

You travel to your market warehouse once a week to pick up your movies, prep any other needed materials and meet with your team. Travel from kiosk to kiosk on your own to merchandise. Very little direct supervision - must be self-motivated."
