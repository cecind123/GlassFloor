rating,review
bad,"Horrible boss, horrible work environment, one of the worst jobs I've ever had.  Revolving door nonstop. No one ever stayed beyond a year or two maximum. Horrible pay and no room for advancement."
bad,"Too much nepotism in upper management. Staff are treated poorly, their success depending solely on that of unethical Financial Advisors. Their strong beliefs in micromanaging and scripts creates a hostile, unpleasant work environment. Co workers and management are unsupportive and deceitful. Hours of work demanded by management make it impossible to enjoy anytime away from the office."
bad,"I have a gag order in place.  I cannot say negative things about the company per that order.  I can tell you that there are companies in America that present themselves as legitimate and honest enterprises."
bad,"stay away from any franchise owned Ameriprise office.  So, that effectively means all of them.  There is no recourse if you have a problem.  HR, and I use that term loosely, is on the payroll of the owner.  There is no partisan employee there to help you.  In no way was I integrated in the practice.  Horrible experience overall.  Good luck!"
bad,Worst work experience I’ve ever had between the boss and her assistant! Very rude disrespectful didn’t want to do any of their own work. Poor training and talked very bad about their clients! Everything was for their own good not for the best for the client!
bad,"Awful.  Awful. Awful. Awful. I hated every minute of it.  Every single minute was horrible.  Unless you were a favorite or part of the in crowd, you were made to feel like a terrible, poor, human being."
bad,Ameriprise only works with Costco customers and 90% of the applications submitted have to go through a pre-issuance process which is a pain. The customers have to physically send in an application that has to be reviewed by an inept underwriting team that only works until 4pm PST and no later. The company is very behind the times and says that it values it's customers but makes them jump through all kinds of hoops for insurance. Miserable job with escalated calls and low pay-absolutely no commission.
bad,What I learned working at Ameriprise financial in Minneapolis Minnesota is that Ameriprise is a really good place to work. it was close to home and I really liked it.
bad,Management lacked the basic needs to support you in learning and the proper training structure to be effective in the position. Ultimately the position ended when I submitted a 2 week notice and they said to not bother coming in. That summed up the work environment.
bad,"Very unorganized training very unprofessional childlike atmosphere. The trainer discussed personal information that was very unpleasant and was very hard to focus on the actual training. Spent more time socializing instead focusing on the training material for life events. Managers were okay but they should really screen who they hire because when they are not in the classroom the trainer is talking about them and discussing their pay and other employees pay and the gossip is so unconformable, and coming to a new company no one should have to hear repetitive gossip regarding other employees and personal life experience regarding how you live your life drugs, alcohol etc should stay personal do not involve new hires. Very relaxed and unprofessional trainer and if you don't fit in and involve yourself in the gossip you are treated differently. Had to resign I have never experienced such a poor and negative experience in my life. I know I have what it takes to make sure customers are satisfied, but will not involve myself in hostile work environment my reputation and integrity is far greater than. I received certificate for having a pleasant jolly attitude and all but enough is enough."
bad,Just do not work here. I promise you will hate it. You have a lot of time to do nothing. You constantly have to worry about your boss being upset with you or other behavior issues which caused me (a female) to quit. You will understand once you work there. I am not alone with this opinion
bad,"Management is not helpful at all in developing employees as they are more worried about their own job security. Also, provides false reviews of project consultants if they do not like you personally. This is unhelpful in obtaining future contract positions with Ameriprise."
bad,"Did not care about their people, draw against commission, taking vacation was near impossible, micromanaged, pushed high commission company products at customers, long hours."
bad,"No Team"
bad,The financial consultants are very stressed and take it out on employees by belittling them. Bullying by other employees occurs and the person being bullied is penalized.
bad,"Don't work for them if you want to save your dignity and self-respect. If your boss does not like you for any reason, she will devise ways to get you fired."
bad,"Ameriprise puts up a good front, but underneath the surface is nothing but nastiness. Recruiters are overworked and crabby on the phone. Hiring managers enjoy playing games with interviews - frequently late. And the pay is less than competitive. Apply at your own risk."
bad,Boring place to work at.
bad,"N/A"
bad,"Slow job, came in at 8am and was done with my work for the day by 9am. Was let go due to cutbacks after Ameriprise took over our company originally owned by FSC."
bad,Red flag should have been that there were no current back office staff with over a year on the job even though the practice was established many years ago.
bad,short internship but i got to meet a lot of big wigs and learn how they became so sucessful in their industry.  Got to go out in the field with them too
bad,By far the worst work experience I've ever had. The branch I was at was like a franchise and the 2 partners were horrible managers that fought with each other every time they were near one another.
bad,"This might be the worst place to go, not only to work, but to get any kind of financial advice. When I worked there as an advisor, the only consideration as to what kind of financial plan to create for a client was ""let's figure out what brings in the highest commission"". There was never any consideration (though we went through the motions) for the clients financial situation, it was all about the commission. All we were instructed to do was present as a solution, in most cases the most inappropriate financial products given the clients circumstances, but solutions that would generate the most commission. Anyone who goes to Ameriprise, either to work or for financial advice is making a big mistake."
bad,"No growth for assistant. Typical day expenses, expense, filing, meeting, meeting, more meeting and take all work home with you. Didn't learn anything new. Management sucks. I have never felt so belittle in a workplace. Worst place to work. So many lay offs! Good luck! Hardest part is no structure."
bad,"Long hours and little respect. The management team does not respect employees or their needs. With headquarters in MN, they are not aware of the Boston culture or rates. Employees in Boston are hired for the lowest rate and not the best value making projects very hard to deliver."
bad,"I worked for Ameriprise as a temp not a good experience because you work long hours therefore you and no life outside of work. In addition, communication from management sucks."
bad,"This position was sold as a chance to help people.  The company made no attempt to hide that they expected you to work hard, long hours.  The company sold the idea that a new hire could work hard for 3 or 4 years and then be making outstanding money while working minimal hours.  The company expected employees to work 57 hours per week at a minimum.  Less than 5% of hires become successful at this company, but they will hire anybody.  Those that do become successful are promoted to become ""managers"" that are given all of the clients that those who do not succeed under their ""management"" were able to gain."
bad,"veru bad company in every aspect"
bad,Weak management. Frequently unethical. Poor customer service. Empty promises. Very poor back office functions. Usually had to call a 2nd or 3rd time to get a resolution. No distinctive products or services that can't be easily found at competitors. Avoid at all cost!
bad,Brags about not having taken bailout but will lay off employees in a heartbeat to show better numbers. Training confusing. Used to over-hire clearly unqualified candidates before the economic crisis who would not pass the Series 7 and 63 who just took a few free paychecks for a month or two while they sat around and browsed the internet. Put on overpriced morale seminars. Painted weird clouds in lobby. Then reality hit and they panicked. Changed advertising slogan. They ruined plenty of lives.
bad,laid off after 28 years they don't care about people cheap too big
bad,"no process in place."
bad,"What to say?  YMMV in this role, which is highly dependent on the personality mix of those around you at a given branch.  In mine, it was a doozy.  We didn't have an ops leader (or THAT ""leader's"" leader) for years but, thanks to the conventional wisdom of the powers-that-be up in Minnesota, they shoe-horned two complete dolts into said roles, neither of whom had any management experience whatsoever.  You can probably already figure out where this is headed but, in a nutshell, it ended badly for a number of us because we weren't the proverbial ""teacher's pets"" that they wanted us to be.  So, in no short order, they managed to orchestrate increasingly ridiculous scenarios for us to stumble into and, subsequently, start their paper trail of written warnings to justify our inevitable terminations.  Sorry, but when you fire a girl for being 10 minutes late because she's 7-and-a-half months pregnant and had to rush to the ob/gyn for something (but was still professional enough to call all her advisers, aka her REAL bosses to let them know--none of whom had any issue with this, for the record), then you're just operating at a whole new level of lowliness.  I could go on, but you get the idea.  This is a dead-end job with no potential for upward mobility (though they'll tell you otherwise with a straight face, which is laughable), so you're essentially stuck being, as one of my adviser's so eloquently put it on a semi-regular basis, a ""glorified secretary"" until you either get enough self esteem to look elsewhere or get axed because someone doesn't like you and they made it their business"
bad,"Very poor management skills on many upper level employees. Work life balance is a joke. Most employees are salaried and spend at least 50+ hours a week working to keep up and are still told they are not doing a good enough job to meet goals.  Everyone in the department can say the goals are unattainable but upper management won't change them. Also stress no overtime for hourly but no way to NOT have overtime and get all your work done. "
bad,Tone clinic stands for cold calling five-and-ten year old Leeds during what they call phone clinic kind twice A-day 2 and a 1/2 hours twice a day ands every other Saturday.
bad,"Don't work here unless you need a job desperately. The work is monotonous and endless, and the pay is not worth the time. A typical day includes filing (both paper and electronic,) mailing, copying, scanning, staple removing, organizing data via excel spreadsheets, putting together financial plans, and any busy work anyone else in the office may have. Basically, this job is like being an assistant for the ENTIRE office, but you don't get more than $10 an hour, or $12 max. Also, you owe money at the end of the year from working at this job because it is considered contract work."
bad,"While Ameriprise Corporate may be in and of itself a good place to work as some have reported, RiverSource (their Annuities and Insurance company) is an organization to avoid if you value your self-esteem, talents and skills. You will be micro-managed and working with an under-current of rampant mistrust, condescension, and elitism among your peers, as well as leader(s), in an environment of utter chaos, and completely self-serving individuals, bent on their own personal gain. "
bad,"Senior leadership lack understanding of strategic procurement, resulting in a mostly tactical approach.  Very hostile executive management culture, resistant to change.  Extreme turnover prevents continuous improvement in procurement organization."
bad,The AAC Paid for licenses but didnt provide any additional training. High turn over. Their goal is diversity but don't advance woman or people of color. They pay insultingly low. Their advisor in training program is a joke. The entire culture is dysfunctional. Management makes fun of employees behind their backs instead of provide structured feedback and training. If you provide two weeks notice they just fire you. This place is run by children. I would not recommend this place to work let alone to a client.
bad,The management was poor. False promises. Only wanted you to sell their products to clients. Not a very driven environment. Not enough guidance and or support.
bad,While you are working on you series 7 you are a telemarketer setting appointments.  After that you sell personalized plans that aren't personalized.  The plans are a plug and play program that basically says the same thing for 95% of the clients.  Financial planners are pushed to sell products based in highest company return rather than what is appropriate for the client.
bad,This place was the most horrible place to work.   They work you like a dog and want you to do everything and get it done in a 40 hour work week -  IMPOSSIBLE!!    They would just keep adding to your workload but not give you any kind of extra pay.   Management was horrible and if you didn’t do what they wanted you to do they wouldn’t think twice about turning on you and firing you.   That place is a very petty place and it’s like you’re working with a bunch of five-year-olds who are tattle tails.   I would not recommend anybody to work for this company.   I quit working for this place because the work load life balance was so ridiculous and the stress of working for this company wasn’t worth the health issues.
bad,"The workplace culture is very negative.  They don't want you to succeed.  Hardworking and dedicated staff/advisors, but upper management lacks support."
bad,Partners control everything - say one thing do another. All talk no action. Was told they wanted me to service clients but they never turned over clients to me. It was a hodge podge of people running around without much organization.
bad,Awful job. Best sugar coaters in the industry. compensation is awful for the work you do. The most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out for the day.
bad,"The Ameriprise Adviser Center in Las Vegas, NV has changed from a place for young talent interested in the financial industry to gain experience, learn, and grow to a monotonous gear box designed to churn ""clients"" for their money."
bad,"The Job requires a lot of prospecting and managing your time, sadly this isn't the biggest challenge. Everyone saturates a market and the competition is great. If being pushy isn't your style, you should know that this company is not for you since there is very little service support to help promote your business. There are scripts that must be practiced weekly and you better not step outside of them. Talking points must be uniform. there is nothing sincere in the way the firm pursues clients. Your compensation is based only on what you produce and if you can't make their thresholds, you receive a draw-salary that is expected to be paid back."
bad,People are of no value to this company. It is more about how can they survive at the risk of stepping on others. Ameriprise Auto & Home in Phoenix and Green Bay in particular. The top leadership lack integrity and ethical boundaries wich is supported by HR leadership. And all of the other management drink the coolaid.
bad,Terrible company. Much worse for the clients than the employees. They care about nobody!
bad,Company culture is like Survivor Island. A person should not have high expectations working at Ameriprise Financial. Be careful of your co-workers because you could be knifed in the back when you least expect it. Good luck!
bad,"I can only speak for one franchise office.  It is a tough place to work if you are not familiar with the financial industry and all the compliance requirements."
bad,"It is my hope that other field offices provide more positive work environments. I cannot say that my negative experience would apply to Ameriprise as a whole, but at my location, management was incredibly unprofessional, unsupportive of staff, maintained double standards + unrealistic expectations, and created a completely insufferable work environment."
bad,"The owner of the franchise was terrifying to be around. Erratic mood swings, impossible and lofty goals, would often go through manic episodes where entire procedures would be expected to change in the course of the day. Insane meetings that could take half the day and everyone would leave more confused."
bad,"Office job that is mostly quiet.  Several advisers worked out of one office, so there was some communication between advisers and the staff for each one.  Clients didn't usually get upset, so the customer service aspect was okay."
bad,I worked there 15 years ago. It was unpleasant. They were involved in a lawsuit in how they treated women. It may have changed since then.
bad,Learning is there but work culture is not exceptionally great
bad,"I worked at Ameriprise for many years and had the opportunity to work in many roles. When I left AMP, I was a Manager with the firm and I have to say - I wouldn't go back. So many of the organizations have their priorities off. Instead of focusing on problems with process or procedures, they simply create new 'elite' teams to put band aids on a broken system."
bad,Sell the same products to every client.  Customers are sold on doing financial plans every year when it is unnecessary.  Financial advisers sell expensive annuities to make the biggest commission product.
bad,I would not recommend working at this business. The gentleman that took over my bosses accounts was not a kind person. People were overworked and not appreciated for that task.
bad,"I used financial software tools, client specific objectives and personal experience coupled with market knowledge to help people make their financial dreams come true."
bad,"Fortune 500 company?? You couldn't tell working with them. "
bad,Upper management makes changes without understanding impact to current environment. Middle management is a mess. The amount of IT work that is no longer done in the United States is scary. Lack of depth and skills to get projects done correctly and efficiently is not there. IT Teams don't work together and there is a lack of competence across the entire IT Organization.
bad,"It paid well, but there was no advancement and poor managers with central office in Minneapolis uncommunicative.  It was newly acquired Columbia Management by Ameriprise and it was too big for them to manage at first"
bad,"Very fasted paced business.  Great, accurate work produced by the team, providing a quality product to the client. Firm helps clients reach their goals and live the type of retirement they envisioned they would."
bad,"horrible culture, firing employees without cause on a whim of a complex director. complex directory in century city fired me on the spot with no consideration give. real horrible experience."
bad,"Stressful place and lack of career advancement opportunities. they would rather keep hiring new employees and pay for their training than advancing the employees who are already there. The other thing they have a ridiculous slow and outdated technology for their software that is very frustrating to use as it keeps crashing almost daily. If you enjoy micro management than this is the place for you. However, I would not recommend anyone looking for advancement or growth to work here."
bad,"Hated having to spend all day talking to angry Costco members who seemed to be 100% certain that they were going to pick up a super-cheap insurance policy, no matter what their claims history looked like."
bad,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc. was an interesting experience.  They make you take a lot of tests before you even have an interview.  They have tests that determine which area of Ameriprise you can work in."
bad,chrunning organuzation they tell you warm leads but you call people who mainly hate you
bad,"Ameriprise has you memorize a script and read it word for word to potential clients, really?!?! Yes, really, WORD FOR WORD. Bang out 100 calls a day or else. Also, new advisors mainly focus on giving presentations at free lunches to people who are only there for the free lunch and nothing more."
bad,We were just a number. Management had an extremely negative attitude. No consistency focused solely on negative aspects of any situation. No flexibility at all. Did not treat employees well.
bad,"i was hired as a financial advisor and had to go through a 10-week trial by fire training course with other new-hires. If we didn't each get 5 new clients (the new clients had to spend at least $500 on a financial plan) in the ten weeks then we were to be terminated even though we had spent about a thousand dollars on our training and licensing materials over a three month stress-filled, unpaid studying period."
bad,"I was in the AAC, which was great before 2013 with the best training in the business. The model was changed and the training department closed. The environment turned toxic."
bad,"Provided support to owner.  Job set up for restoration services.  Continued Education class registrations.  Perform daily clerical functions: phone, filing, mail, data management."
bad,They only time they cared is when you told them you were leaving.. Management bonuses were based on bodies and production.
bad,in the insurance department your are just a number easily replaced and they are blatant about their lack of concern for your advancement and overall well being.
bad,Very little support. Highly encouraged to use your personal contact to generate new business.  Wanted you to sell before actually understanding what you were doing.
bad,"Ameriprise is a big company located in downtown Minneapolis. Parking lots cost money, but great security service and fresh food."
bad,Getting close to clients best part. busy office and challenging position.
bad,No one is happy in the Las vegas office. They took away commission among other things. which mean I have to change my whole life I have to move into a smaller home refinance my car.
bad,"They are not using talent wisely and have the most inept and incompetent people assigned as ""leaders"".  This, in turn, works against them because the talented and dedicated people who work for them are more intelligent and their ideas for streamlining processes get shot down because the ""leader"" doesn't want to be upstaged."
bad,Ameriprise is a decent place to work but work load is too much.
bad,Worked in a small practice where everyone had their role but there wasn't much room to grow or do much else.  Boss unwilling to teach and did not care to try to develop me.
bad,Manager would not even let you have a sticky note or phone list left out on your desk. I took a paid day off and came back to having my desk rearranged when there was no one covering for me when I was gone. My supervisor was awesome but the guy above her was a micromanager.
bad,"Auto & Home Departments do not have the tools needed to succeed."
bad,"This was a fast paced environment to move clients to Ameriprise.  I had to fill out upload all ACATs to transfer clients from the former company.  Service clients during and after the transition.  I handled all of the paperwork for new clients.  Ensured the day to day rules & regs of the office, for the manager, were followed."
bad,"I enjoyed my job at Ameriprise but was not happy with my Supervisor. She had difficulty handling stress and had little self control. It made my stress free job, very stressful."
bad,"Not a nice place to work as it is expected to work at least 15 hours a day which will disturb your work life balance."
bad,"Working at Ameriprise Financial was not an enjoyable experience. It was a call center. Customers with accounts would call up and very rudely, and ignorantly speak to the customer service reps about their accounts. They were often upset about the progress of their accounts."
bad,"Company encourages nepotism and loves to micro-manage. Advisers are unethical, but as long as they are making money for the company they are allowed to keep practicing."
bad,"Working at a franchise office was much different then working for ameriprise corporate. We had about 20 staff members, all of which were paid the minimum."
bad,Great training for someone will little to no financial experience. There are often opportunities though where advisors make suggestions that are better for them financially than clients.
bad,"Ameriprise reels you in with promise of a high salary, but pays you about 1/3rd of what is promised. Expect 12 hour days of pounding phones and annoying customers with repeated phone calls. One of the worst jobs I've ever had."
bad,"As in many large companies, it all depends on who you work for. The ability to work remotely, promotions, opportunities for growth, salary, etc. are all dependent upon how great your leader is, and not necessarily because of what you offer the company."
bad,I like Ameriprise corporate but the franchise model that I worked in didn't allow for any growth potential.  All but one of the advisors I worked for were stingy - few increases in pay and the last one didn't come through on the bonuses or pay increases initially promised.   All in all stay away from franchise companies.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the day was greeting the clients. A lot is expected of the position. You must be efficient, productive, and have a great memory. You must be able to multitask and be able to be interrupted during those tasks and return to them efficiently. You must also be able to handle a lot of stress and pressure. The hardest part of the job was that for most of the years I worked there, I had very few benefits. No health, dental, eye, or retirement plans. The office was considered an independent contractor, so didn't have to supply these."
bad,"Over the past five years the numbers of licensed advisors has decreased from around 250 down to about 50. Over that same period of time the number of people with ""Sales Director"" in title has increased from 3 to 4, and the number of people with ""Vice President"" in title increased from 1 to 4. "
bad,"The pay is top notch for a call center customer service Representative position and the benefits are extraordinary too.  They do this for good reason....high turn over.  The work is grueling and your performance is judged daily. They have so called coaches and leaders who sit around and giggle all day or find or nitpicking, rather, your faults. Then your performance from the previous day gets displayed for all to see and even discussed every single morning.  They'll push you to quit or get fired. The ones who actually make it are robots who couldnt possibly embody a true, empathetic customer service representative. They do what they're told, despite right or wrong. Ameriprise wants to be the best of the best in terms of customer service, what happened to being the best of the best at wealth management? Some hire ups should really reevaluate the people they have underneath them, because there's a whole lot of perfume on a pig."
bad,"Completely based on the advisor who employed me, but this was my worst career experience ever, by far.  Put seniors at risk of losing savings with undue risks taken in investment vehicles, poor haphazard office with no consistency of personnel or process."
bad,"Negative, cut throat environment with little leadership direction nor advancement and training opportunities. Co workers talk behind one another's backs and use foul language."
bad,disappointing company.  working for an advisor in the field you can clearly see that the company takes a substantial amount of any commission he makes.
bad,Management is inexperienced and hostile to new ideas. The culture is unbelievably negative and I would advise extreme caution to anyone recruited by this company.
bad,"Las Vegas NV Call Center Former Employee: I needed to resign my customer service position in financial services so I gave 2-week notice to my team lead. She later told me that since I had given proper notice, Ameriprise was offering to release me from the 2 week fulfillment period. She said I could leave anytime and it would not affect my good standing. I accepted the offer to leave early, finished the week and left that Friday."
bad,"The company as a whole is decent, however the location I worked in and another one I was later going to accept a management position in, I can’t say the same. The compensation is ok, the benefits were very good. There is absolutely no room for advancement unless you want to become an advisor or move to their call center in Minneapolis. Management was inadequate at best - not one person holding a management position that I had to deal with was qualified to be in a management position. They do not recognize talent and hard work, however they will hold on to unqualified staff members. If you want to get ahead you have to know somebody within the company - favors are a massive part of their hierarchy - which is the reason unqualified people get hired. I was also exposed to sexism and other forms of mistreatment – management and HR did nothing to correct the issue."
bad,"Went to work for the Goshen, NY office approximately 5 years ago.  They hired me part time to train me.  After approximately 2 months I was told they wouldn't need me anymore.  No warning, nothing.  When I was hired I was led to believe the job would become permanent after the office manager returned from maternity leave.  She left to have the baby and I was left without a job."
bad,No much upward movement unless you willing to relocate to headquarter or even option to transfer to ameriprise financial since they are franchise. That is reason why I left.
bad,Your experience w/this company will depend completely on the branch you work for and the advisor you're under. They sometimes offer transition package
bad,I've worked here for a very long time and it's a very sink or swim environment. Management lacks ethics and misconduct does not get reported or handled properly. It's very hands off place to work in you receive little to no feedback unless if it's negative. Employee turnover is huge especially amongst the sales assistants.  Technology is not up to industry standard and lacks innovation.
bad,The advisors were graded more on how well they could read a script versus the financial marketplace. Funds were picked based on who was giving the best incentives.
bad,Worked in a small office with 2 advisors. the overall office was run pretty poorly. I'm sure that other Ameriprise offices have a better system for running there offices
bad,"If the senior manager didn't like you, you would not get properly recognized for your work, or get the raise you deserved. They have zero loyalty for their employees. Left and haven't been happier.  They claim they care about work/life balance, but they don't."
bad,"High demanding job, with low pay, and not many perks to working there. Worked long hours, the franchise CEOs were not great people to work for. long days."
bad,a company with constantly changing rules. overall poor morale. if the job is unable to be done in 40 hours look for a new job. no exceptions.  unreasonable expectations for job
bad,"Typical sales work, enjoyed client interaction. Typical day stated with training classes. Followed up by application paperwork, customer account maintenance."
bad,Very low pay and culture is very bad; the work is very copy and paste type so no learning takes place; the management encourages politics  in the work place.
bad,"The company's number one stated core value is integrity, however, the management above the supervisor position has rarely shown any. Anything promised or eluded to should be taken with a grain of salt."
bad,"pay sucks and bonus structure which u won't see anything at least 3 to 4 months due to training just in  auto alone and up to 6 months on the home side. is horrible,  40 % of the business you  write won't paid out for month or two months , the hours are swing 10 - 7  and till 5 on saturdays.  best advice i can give use them to pay for your property and casualty  license  and pass it  then bolt and give them the middle finger."
bad,"Correspondence, data processing, financial & stock reviews, client meetings, Series 7, marketing/website, work flow process"
bad,"As a front line customer service rep, I was the 1st person a customer would talk to after being in a accident or having a property damage issue. I documented the info and asked general questions to make sure we where on the same page. Could not actually tell customer anything other then their claim had been filed and to wait for a call. This was the most frustrating thing about the job. Customers would call in for information after calling in multiple times and waiting for days with no response. The management always said the same thing like a broken record."" Have them leave a voice mail with their claim rep. even if they have already left multiple messages""."
bad,"Where to start. During the interview process they stress customer service. Once you start training, that all goes out the window. Leaders couldnt care less about ther ""service"" aspect and only stress call reduction methods. You are in constant scrutiny on your phone stats and how long you may have been before you took the next call. If you are not in a ready state for more than 3 minutes they will hunt you down. No customer service focus as they stress. Shifts change every 6 months and are supposably tied to performance. (Yeah right) I am a top performer in my department in stats and somehow got the late shift when others who show up late every day and call in sick once a week somehow got the preferred shift. Oh and PTO, forget about that. They give you a ton but never approve your time. And you have to use you're own PTO for company holidays. What a crock. My advice, stay away from phone teams and service delivery as a whole. You're just another number, unless you're a brown noser. Good luck!"
bad,"I have never worked for a company that has little to no leadership. Employees are numbers not people. You say one wrong thing that someone takes wrong and you will be canned. My advice, keep looking for other opportunities or never stop looking for a better alternative. Most corporate companies appreciate you. This one will not."
bad,This job was not the right fit and I decided to move on for the sake of the business.
bad,I enjoyed talking with clients and learning more about the financial world. I would typically answer the phones and answer basic calls regarding customer accounts. Helped the financial advisors with customer accounts. The hardest part of the job was the lack of information given to me in order to provide the best client service possible.
bad,Through dealing with clients at times other departments did not work cohesively with others. Constant battle to complete claims with other departments because no one wanted to take initiative in helping one another. Management plays favoritism and if you were not apart of the clique you were a possible target.
bad,"Fundamentally a sales organization: perception trumps reality. The management works very hard to convince each other that they are engaged in strategic transformation while actively avoiding fundamental transformation, primarily by concocting (or copying) different names for what is already happening.  It is a good place to practice pretend analytics."
bad,"If you want to be a personal assistant to your boss this job is perfect for you. I was promised training, but the training was by a paraplanner who didn't want to be bothered. I had no prior experience in the field and wondered why they hired me. A complete waste of time."
bad,The job is stressful and fast paced. It is often frustrating due to extremely high demands with inadequate training to prepare you for the job. The best part of the job is that it is not mundane and you must continue to learn and adapt to be successful.
bad,Difficult to get days off. Supervisor does not support or back representatives. Heavy workloads that requires overtime to manage. No relief while out of office.
bad,its a revolving door of adjuster coming in and leaving. they operate on a claims system that goes seems to go back to pre historic ages. upper management is lacking competency and company is too top heavy.
bad,"I enjoy working here as an I.A.R. Many product lines to work with, and my clients are wonderful."
bad,"Meeting-centric culture that stifles leadership and innovation by measuring performance based on dashboards, deadlines and finances rather than quality and business suitability of solutions."
bad,"Task oriented management team."
bad,The company was great when I started but when they shifted how the employees should operate it negated everything promised from the interviews to obtain the job. I would not tell anyone to seek employment from this company who is a go getter and trend setter.
bad,"They talk about opportunities for advanced, don’t listen. The only jobs that open up are the ones that are trash and the ones that are any decent have about 1000 applicants."
bad,Depending on the leader you have you will either have a fantastic experience or one where you're constantly worried about being fired.................
bad,"Ameriprise is a strong, reliable company to work for. However, the franchised branch I work for was held back due to unwillingness to conform to common new practices."
bad,"Did not have adequate management and was unfairly let go due to personal relationship with an advisor.  The job itself can be gratifying, but management was clueless."
bad,"Several managers are recent graduates without any experience, children or understanding of how a corporate, professional environment works. The pay scale for similar positions varies significantly between people with similar background and education.  There are some uneducated peers getting paid  15%-18% more than an educated person - not right.  They love to tell you how you get more money when you leave and come back or they know they are the lowest paying but don't want to pay more..."
bad,Very decentralized management structure which prevented project teams form successfully working together. Folks were allowed to work  from home and many key players did not regularly participate in leadership meetings.
bad,Takes too long to accomplish a task. Technology is a bit below par. Limited experts in all departments. Most of the employees are legacy employees and don't realize the downfalls of the company.
bad,"Unreasonable expectations. Life work balance was good, but work expectations were higher than expected going into the position.  Nice office, but balancing working with advisors was unreasonable."
bad,I was a returning employee with a higher level of education than management.  Director was an insecure jerk who enjoyed nit picking everything I do and was very intimidated of me because I had pointed out to him that they need to provide customers cost basis for the accounts.
bad,Management support to programs/project are less than expected. Confusing and less than cooperative relationship between various teams involved in a project.
bad,"Worked there 14 years doing various jobs but was involved in a car accident that kept me out of work for a while. As soon as my short term disabilty ran out, my job was elminated. They encouraged me to apply for the new version of my job..but got the dear john letter.."
bad,"Ameriprise Financial I enjoyed worked for, however they were doing a lot of outsourcing to India and we were loosing portions of our job duties and not gaining anything in addition."
bad,"I also handled the reception desk for the office.  The daily work consisted of speaking with the clients and working with the Financial Advisors to service the clients and their accounts. I answered the phone and greeted the clients when they came in for their appointments.  I was responsible for processing all the paperwork associated with the client accounts and account transfers including paperwork for Annuity Contracts. I also processed money movements, stock transactions and overall account maintenance.  "
bad,"Salary is great for grad students with low cost of living. Great culture, and very friendly co-workers. Good practice for providing exceptional customer service. Everyday is very occupied in a good way."
bad,The company itself is great. What it stands for and all. It's just unfortunate that alot of the stuff they have in place to help manage the company's employees is awful. I was let go from there for being Ill and having proof of illness but because policy mandated it I was let go without a behavioral or last warning. There's no room to mess up especially with absences. There's really no way around it you have to manage your time well or it will bite you in the long run. I was a top performing agent with fantastic reviews and well here we are.
bad,Constant pressure meeting metrics.....call center setting so always busy...be prepared to take 50 calls a day unless your on mandatory overtime which is basically the entire summer....then expect more....hours are horrible...they change every 6 months and you could be working anywhere from 6 am until 12 am.....so if you have kids or a family...good luck planning around that....managment doesnt care about anything but themselves...they act like they care about you and your issue but at the end of the day your just a number and if your not producing then they will find someone else
bad,The owner of the firm  micro-managed and was worried about other advisers leaving with his clients. Clients were not happy with him at all. Assets under-management were slowly diminishing.
bad,"The management I had was very unprofessional and the communication was difficult among us. I didn't feel the pay was fair for the amount of hours you'd put into a day or questioned why you were working over time, so obviously she was not aware of the work load."
bad,"Good place to start but I don't know if I would recommend it for any senior members of the financial world, it was a good place as a young guy to start working and build my portfolio"
bad,"This review applies to field environment only - I do not work at corporate office so not very sure what it is like there."
bad,Everyone is a team player no one is left behind. We support one another and encourage one another. I loved interacting with all the customers and catering to their needs.
good,This was an internship for me. I did not have many responsibilities but management and culture are not on the top of the list for this individual practice.
good,Management was very difficult to work with. The company did not fully disclose all costs to clients. They had a pay to play arrangement and did not disclose.
good,this place is very boring although the area was great but the weather also was bad 7 month of the year it snowed so the atmosphere was a bit depressing.
good,"I was extremely professional and had great interaction with all my co-workers and clients.  I learned a lot about financial planning and complete management of the office.  That was definitely the highlight of my position.  However, the offices of Ameriprise Advisors are all franchises and the Manager/Owner of the financial firm I worked for was tyranical, abusive, made numerous jokes of a very unprofessional nature and finally I decided it was time to walk away and start my family."
good,Was engaged to serve as in house retirement specialist for practice of 30 FA's in multiple states. Plan revenue to be pooled and shared by 10 partners. Partners reluctant to refer into case and now have exceptions to the guidelines. Basic case of uncommunicated expectations and probable resentment for my arrangement.
good,Unsupportive managerial team who often cajoled less then successful employees. Quotes were also set to high to be actually obtainable. Needless to say I was proud to acquire my Series 7 & 63.
good,"if you've seen one callcenter, you've seen them all. it is not likely that the environment has changed. they need warm bodies in the chairs to answer phones."
good,"A typical day would be being a part of the meetings,reporting to the team lead and developing test cases and executing them."
good,This is a small town office and my co workers were very personal and  had no reserve for privacy.
good,Stress too much for anyone. My Management was not flexible with reasonable exceptions. Culture was great. Co workers always great.  Not a bad place. But not a good one.
good,"I was recruited based upon my financial experience and training and told there would be plenty of work made available to me.  Upon actually working with this company where I was hired as a financial advisor, quickly found that it was really a cold calling insurance sales position.  One benefit that I learned was a higher appreciation for the sales function and what it takes to successful at it."
good,Unfortunately there is not room for growth in the company unless you become an Ameriprise Financial Advisor. I was working for a senior advisor and unfortunately I could never get to his level of pay unless I become an advisor and start my own practice.
good,If you hate work life balance this is the place for you. Not a fan of the leadership and not a fan of how the company low key advocates work life balance but doesn't back it up.
good,"The company as awhole has great benefits and located on the ""out skirts"" of downtown. The department I was working in had us work almost 7 days a week for over a year. Work/Life balance was the main reason I gave them a bad rating. Also the HR department was not very engaging when reporting issued involving management and its employees"
good,"I was hired by a company that was acquired by Ameriprise. Unfortunately, it seems they are moving everything up to their headquarters in Minneapolis so I got the boot after conversion, along with most of the rest of the employees at the original company."
good,"Poor management and favoritism from supervisor. Hardest part of job was no communication and not good team players. Very fast paced which I didn't mind. I run a big machine which I don't enjoy, has a lot of problems constantly and I'm not very mechanically inclined. Would like to do be more in an office setting ,desk job. Benefits and vacation are fair. Would like more of a variety of tasks. I am always doing the same thing and would like to know i have the opportunity for advancement in company."
good,"Management wanted work done, no questions asked. There was not a lot of direction or instruction for how to get the job done or to what degree tasks should be completed, but if you couldn't figure out how to complete the tasks with the lack of instruction, you would be reprimanded."
good,"I worked part-time for 3 financial advisors. The work was typical admin chores - calling clients, scheduling appointments, processing paperwork through their database. I enjoyed speaking with their clients."
good,"I worked for Ameriprise Auto and Home Insurance for almost 10 years.  It went from a small customer based insurance company that cared about it's customers as individuals to a larger customer based insurance company that did not look at the customer as much as a person but as a number and it's employees much the same.  Growth changed the company and made it a hard place to work and feel valued, or feel like I was making a difference for my customers."
good,"•	Be first impression customers see and work with when entering office."
good,I would not recommend Ameriprise Financial to a financial advisor. There was no sense of culture at this firm. There is a cold corporate atmosphere.
good,It was a fun and great experience. The only problem was that there wasn't any opportunity to advance. Good environment and wonderful people.
good,Traded mutual funds and securities for several advisors in a small office. Talked to clients and completed applications and other forms for service requests.  Most enjoyable part of my job was being busy and enjoyed client interactions.
good,"Long hours, decent pay but not enough. Things are changing at a rapid pace. Can be an ok career for the right person."
good,"Leadership (management) is horrible. Not only are managers in positions they should never hold, but management changes over too often."
good,"I have been employed with this Company in PracticeSource Dept from last 2 and half year. A typical day at work for a fresher is fine and not hectic until an year. However, once you start getting more responsibilities it takes a toll on your Work Life balance as work wise it's not that difficult however the additional managerial work that one needs to do takes half of your day and then to complete your work you have to stay back. Work culture is fine however, too much of interference in your personal life. The most amazing part is that you get most of the US Fixed holidays and Indian holidays as well. So, in total 24 of paid leaves, 3 Optional leaves, 7 Sick Leaves and 12 Fixed leaves."
good,I choose not to provide this information as I feel it would be biased and is required for me to advance in my career. I welcome questions during an interview but not in an on line service.
good,"The company is not bad overall. I just couldn't work at a call center and I was misled to think otherwise. The trainers were great, thorough and made the boring topic of insurance fun."
good,"The business is growing but my position was dissolved."
good,"This company is your standard American Fortune 500 Company.  It's based out of MInneapolis, but the executive leadership works out of the New York offices."
good,Ameriprise is good place except few departments in which favoritism is there. Many leaders are very cooperative and working with them is pleasure. Salary structure need to improve.
good,"Love my co workers and the company, benefits are great to. But if your not a favorite you will not move up. I want to work where my experience is taken into consideration."
good,"It was good for an introduction to the financial services industry, but for some reason I found it impossible to advance within the ranks of the company.  Gives me a foul taste in my mouth to this day."
good,Overall I enjoyed my coworkers and interaction with clients.
good,"Granted, I worked for a Private Wealth Advisor, so they are all different.  Mediocre pay, poor communication from management, no benefits.  However, this is a fantastic learning opportunity for someone who is looking to be a financial advisor."
good,Franchise offices and each are run differently.   Some are great...mine is not.  No opportunity for advancement and job security has nothing to do with how well you do your job.
good,"I was happy but was not satisfied with the work. So, the reason was the profile or work which I was doing."
good,"This company truly is inclusive of all cultures, nationalities, how one identifies, they welcome and accept everyone. The benefits package is great however if you start on a phone queue the bay is minimal."
good,"Day-to-day tasks, worked under a team of financial advisors. small business, had to wear multiple hats to help the business move along. Best part of the job was the regional meetings and perks that the company offers."
good,"I worked in a call center for a very short period of time. I am therefore unable to provide a very clear picture of the overall work environment. I will say that all the leaders that I worked for were excellent,"
good,"Hired as contract to cover a medical leave with extensions, however supervisor chose not to provide in-depth training. At nine months, I should be able to perform more complex task and I'm board with just general duties and scanning. "
good,Extremely stressful environment. My leader had little experience with this level of employee and could not articulate positive or constructive feeback well.
good,I really was not all that impressed with their propriety products or the sales technique that pushed us to use. This was a sales position and only the people who were putting numbers on the board were getting significant mentoring.
good,Very stressful environment.  Making many cold calls. Leads were very poor and few. Typical financial entry level position where you will be spending more time in the office than being at home with family.
good,Very sedentary work place.  You get to talk to people all over the US.  Hours are pretty good.  They have 3 shifts available since they operate in most states in the US.
good,Management at the company is not very solid. There are a lot of people making decisions that don't have a perspective of the outside environment. Processes are lengthy and don't add value to the employee. It is a company that an experienced representative would not flourish.
good,"Leveraged this opportunity to learn a lot of things, but it's dominated by politics. Merit is hardly considered. There is little chance to advance unless you play political games."
good,I worked in the auto and home division. Most areas were fantastic; but other areas were ran very poorly with poor management. The work is not gratifying; and managers do not do a very good job in showing gratitude to employees. If you achieve certain levels; the questions then come out as to why you can't do more; versus congratulating you on what you achieved. Also a very HUGE culture of favoritism.
good,"I have worked at this company for over 10 years and have witnessed a significant lack of concern for employees. Emergency daycare - eliminated, Sick days per year reduced from 8 to 6 now at 4. Compensation - commensurate with the industry AKA average.  Military leave benefits - reduced. I have seen good employees get laid off so that they can send those positions off to India. Working for this company has even negatively impacted my credit."
good,"Open office, answer phones, schedule appointments, prep meetings for Advisor. Speak with clients often with financial concerns along with keep office running smooth. Handle all Executive Administrative duties. Close office."
good,The company is a good place to work. To many restrictions on personal days off. Scheduled breaks. I want to move to Oregon.
good,"Ameriprise is a big bureaucracy, and has all of the problems inherent in corporate America - too many layers of management, excessive corporate-speak, etc. The people themselves are generally great, though. The benefits, especially paid time off are good, and it's hard to really complain about a job that is secure, comfortable, and pays the bills. The place is cubicle-city, though, and the people who do well and advance are the ones who can drink the Kool-Aid, speak the corporate language, and play the game of pretending to care about things that don't actually matter much in the larger world."
good,"A typical day at work dealt with management of the Vice Presidents calendar, emails and travel details."
good,"•	Participated in client meetings and presentations initiating advising services"
good,"Short staffed, overworked and non-engaged employees. Little growth opportunities within the company."
good,"After that, everything became about money and the bottom line. They stopped caring about employees. It was easier for them to let an employee leave for better opportunity elsewhere than retain good employees and help them grow within the organization. "
good,A typical day at work involves executing sales and marketing programs over the phone and in person with clients.
good,There is a tremendous amount of change occurring in the IT space today. The direction is not clear and the messages from senior leadership are either contradictory or inconsistent.  There is an effort to downsize the IT organization so that the company can minimize expenses.  The effort seems short-sighted and unsustainable.
good,Allowed me to study for my series 7 license. We were able to study on our own. However we had weekly meetings that were not really focused in the training program. However once licenses were obtained the manager availability to assist in closing clients played a pivotal role in getting our practice started.
good,"This is my first insurance job. But many of my associates have been in the insurance industry for 15 plus years and they advised that this is not the norm in this field. The goals and expectations imposed on the claims staff is unobtainable. This is especially difficult with the lack of automation and antiquated systems and processes. The pay is fairly standard for this industry, however the insurance is pricey and is subpar. Making 20.00 per hour after getting the healthcare for my family I am bringing home less than 12.00 per hour."
good,"-demanding but challenging"
good,"The job was about 50 percent recruiting, 30 Administrative and 20 training and development. I learned their metrics, salesforce and compliance. The hardest part of the job was recruiting to a nonwirehouse platform. The most enjoyable part of the job was offering one of the most lucrative transition packages in the industry."
good,"I haven't worked there in over 15 years. I don't have any comments that would be useful to a current job seeker. I strongly believe in their focus on financial planning. If you are a financial planner, the company would be a good fit."
good,Worked at this company for over 1 year. The advisors are very professional and nice to work all advisor. I ever worked with truly cared about their clients portfolios. Unless you wanted to become a financial advisor there is absolutely no advancement.
good,"Temp position, I was only employed there for 6 weeks.  The managers, associates and staff were very easy to work with.  Everyone at Ameriprise Financial was overall  a very nice pleasant place of employment."
good,"Workplace culture is very diverse."
good,"Good Project Management Office Methodology, insufficient on-boarding process - was not given enough time to thoroughly understand the processes, procedures and culture."
good,If you can handle being the main point of contact for all Insurance based customers and knowing there will always be at least 30 other people ahead of you for promotion then you're golden.
good,Monthly goals were lofty and new employees were not afforded ample time to solicit business.  The office in Knoxville closed due to a lack of personnel retention.  The most difficult portion of this job was the clients that were solicited typically did not want to do business with very young brokers or advisers.  Younger advisors were not afforded the time to develop relationships before asking for business.
good,In my experience only those people would be interested to work here who do not have much to do with finance but feel good in working with an organization that is dealing with financial products. In a way you get a back office work for their Financial Advisors and Portfolio Managers. No matter what level you reach it always will be back office. But I guess not everyone wants the same thing.
good,It was difficult to advance in my department as there were no opportunities. The work place culture was not conducive for advancement. Very few opportunities.
good,"Not a bad place to work - decent PTO/sick time, can progress through the company with hardwood and good performance. But, the job seemed a lot better on paper than it really is. Have you use your PTO for national holidays, work/life balance is awful, extremely difficult to obtain days you actually want off work, work load is unapproachable, you will always work more than 8 hours a day, training is too classroom-oriented and not hands on enough."
good,The day is fast paced and there is a lot to learn about the business inside and outside of the company. Great place to start if you need to earn your licenses.
good,Not a good culture-too profit oriented and not people oriented.
good,I like most of my co-workers. But they do not encourage career development.
good,Office out of area and that made it hard to conduct business with my clients
good,Company has good culture/values/history. The benefit package choices are above average and the people were friendly for the most part.
good,Helped get foot in door into investment-securities industry
good,"While the company offers a lot of additional training, and career development. I've found it very frustrating to maintain a good work/life balance. This is what makes it frustrating to me"
good,"My eight year tenure at Ameriprise Financial was an enjoyable time from start to finish. In my current role, typical days were very high paced and interactive from various aspects of the business. I loved the idea of working with Ameriprise Financial's vast group of Experienced Advisor Recruits. It's always been a passion of mine to work directly with financial advisors in any capacity. I learned about types of loans, awards, and bonuses provided to respective advisors before joining Ameriprise."
good,"I worked in the back office at Ameriprise, and when I left, they were at a crisis point with many managers stepping out of leadership positions. Most teams were understaffed, benefits were good but pay was low, and upper management changed their ""flavor of the week"" absurdly often - Kaizen, then Six Sigma, the Lean, etc."
good,It's a good company but it pays very less if you are well qualified and if you are not ambitious and not from good college you can go there. It provides cab and food. The shift timings are mainly 2-10:30
good,"company does its best to compensate for horrible mistreatment from customers.  They never have your back ""customers are always right"", but they don't have a problem putting in the front line to explain their strict procedures to eliminate their unwanted customers."
good,Not flexible with work/life balance. The overall approach is very top down.  Senior leaders decide without input from boots on the ground employees.  Doesn't feel collaborative.
good,"I was promoted from Administrative Assistant to Client Service Coordinator within a 2 year time-frame. Typical day at work consisted of contacting clients regarding appointments, completion of forms, etc.; checking updates in the systems for FA's, providing weekly numbers for goals set week prior; event planning, code calling, following up on financial plans. Ameriprise was an excellent company to advance in your career."
good,Ameriprise is not a bad place to get your career started and begin to understand how the corporate lifestyle is.  The micro managing at foresters is hard to deal with but the colleagues are nice.  The benefits are decent and the fact that you get rolling over sick days as well is a bonus but ultimately the first 90 days you work there.  They really want you to put in an additional 30-40 hours a week to get licensed which if you are just starting your career and not sure that want to stay in the industry it can create a non existent work life balance
good,Company has a great culture philosophy but gets lost when management has their own culture. Unorganized with metrics and goals....sweep all negatives under the rug and ignore it until it becomes a problems. Very strict on attendance for agents. Otherwise company can be a good stepping stone for someone. There are different areas in the company that may be better than others.
good,Overall its a good place to work with too much work load and very less time for work life balance. Most of time weekends are also busy with very minimum/no appreciation from the management.
good,Worked with other financial advisors to gain insight on developing financial plans for clients. Sought advice from management occasionally to ensure proper delivery of financial plan.
good,They want you to lie to customers which causes extreme rates and did not want us advising how yo save them money. I will llml not go into more detail.
good,"Although the company is continuously working toward making changes to better the claims environment, some old standards have stalled the growth of the field organization."
good,"I worked for an independent agent so I was did not have access to corporate benefit offerings save fee waivers on my financial packages.  If I didn't work, I didn't get paid.  I was never offered paid holidays, vacations, or any pto."
good,"Once you complete your license exams, you are on your own to figure out how to get clients. There is training in phone calls and the products you will offer, but not much beyond that. New advisors were dropping every couple of months due to inability to hit benchmark requirements for attaining new clients.  If you are new to ""sales"" this is not the company for you. If you have sales experience and have been successful in the past, you might make the cut working here."
good,"Overall, I thought the Consulting/Contract was the description of the position. Enjoyed working with my Sr. Director. There were some challenges with one of the projects I worked on that was located outside on MN."
good,"You will be electronically monitored. From the time you punch in, punch out for lunch/ breaks. Phone will be monitored s well. If you do not have a college degree you will be overlooked for advancement."
good,"good company to work for, I was underpaid and overworked because of the old ways I chose to do things.  I would like the opportunity to work there again given the chance."
good,"The first two years were really good. Due to management changes the last two years were very tense and depressing for me. "
good,"I worked for an independent broker using the Ameriprise name.  Had pretty good work/life balance and office outings.  Pay was average but there were no benefits so everything was out of pocket for me (health, dental, etc).  Technology was good and easy to learn.  Every office is different as far as paperwork so it's not the same across Ameriprise.  Be cautious if applying for independent and get what you want in writing and keeps tabs on it."
good,Great managers located in the Chicago offices. Tough if not impossible numbers to reach. You will be asked to resign if your don't reach all of your numbers.
good,"Very busy office where you learn something new on a daily basis. Typical day included answering advisor questions about new policies, planning conferences, and completing paperwork for office inspections. The most enjoyable part was the freedom to work independently with little supervision, which allowed me to develop my skills in problem solving. There were a few offices located in different locations, so communicating with coworkers for questions had to be done via phone. The hardest part of the job was that the training was not always available, but again, it allowed me to become more self-reliant."
good,"A diversified workplace with many different areas to learn in the financial industry (brokerage, mutual funds, life insurance, annuities)."
good,"The company continues to send more and more of the home office jobs overseas, while cutting benefits and eliminating positions.  Every time the company cuts a benefit they state they want to be compatible with the industry but they insist on the best service from employees.  The environment in the office is you should be lucky to have a job and hope that your current one will not be next to go to India."
good,"This was a good job for a while, however, the possibility to grow any further was lacking.  It was a very quiet atmosphere on a daily basis.  I mastered my position in a short time and then found I was bored for a large majority of the time with no challenge.  The times I found most enjoyable were when I had a project to work on, or interacting with clients and wholesalers."
good,Ameriprise is unable to tap retain to talent. Environment is at best tense and not forward looking.
good,Very productive workplace. The possibilities of learning new things are endless.
good,Good atmosphere- Not a lot of vertical growth opportunity. Sub-par compensation
good,Administrative Assistant...handled confidential record keeping.
good,- Learned process of Financial Planning from start to finish with frequent interactions with clients
good,"Administrative management was not up to par. Was not trained on what we knew at all therefore hard to work with having no knowledge. Typical day was very busy and multi-tasking all day. Lots of client contact and sales force support. Admin. Management needed to obtain co-workers that were knowledgeable, not just a warm body and that was a major problem within Ameriprise."
good,"Work with experienced advisors that are transitioning to Ameriprise. It is a very stressful time in their lives due to uprooting their business and clients/accounts from one firm to a new firm. My job is to help make their transition easier by dealing with the client paperwork process. This entails establishing clients and accounts on the Ameriprise systems. This requires me to be up to date with FINRA (as well as Ameriprise's) rules, regulations, policies and procedures such as: Know Your Client (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Licensing, Client information requirements and Privacy, etc. Since Ameriprise is a large company, the workplace culture and management can be different based on what area you work in."
good,"The management is average, however the environment is 100% American which makes its a nice place to work in. There is no work life balance as the senior management keeps on increasing the pressure of work."
good,"Ameriprise is a good company to work for. They have the technology and support to assist you in your current role and opportunities to advance. If working on the franchise side, your experience is dependent on the attitude and culture the franchise owner creates."
good,I worked part time for a franchise owner. I did not receive Ameriprise Financial benefits so I can not comment on them. I did not really interact with the corporate office either.
good,"It was definitely a learning experience but we were expected to do a lot of tasks that had little meaning such as watering plants and running errands. It was a good work environment, just had hoped to learn more."
good,If you like office work this is the place for you. If having a fixed schedule and a strict daily schedule then I would definitley recommend. You definitley need patience and thick skin to work in a call center
good,"I went to work with confidence and clear mind because they were always able to finish their work before tomorrow comes. There was no stress whatsoever. I enjoyed every Friday because we got to wear fun clothes not too stood out, that's for sure. The hardest part was that I had to sit 9 to 5. I wish they could have some workout time twice in a day since it is important for our bodies."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and challenging and enjoyable."
good,"I was constantly bored, severely lacking work to be done. Was never given any new work or challenges. Co-workers were unprofessional and childish. Would not recommend."
good,"My direct manager was great, but the leader of our department and internal partners were very difficult to work with and made for a bad team environment and workplace culture."
good,Not much to say about this company.  I was bought out because of a complaint on my u5.  I didnt agree with this decision but I had no other choice.  I had to find a new career because of this.
good,"Work environment was good"
good,"great opportunity to become a financial advisor if that was the career route you wanted to take, the company involved you with strategic and sales goals"
good,"Quiet and relaxing workplace. A typical day at work would be filing paperwork and sorting data for customers. There was no hard part of the job, it was very easy."
good,Decent company to work for as long as all management are on one accord. Hopefully things has gotten better for the employees overall. Other than that its a good company.
good,"Company was a fair employer. However, the salary was significantly low and benefits were expensive. Spent most of the work day alone with minimal human contact."
good,I obtained all of my licenses while working for the company. I also learned a lot about financial planning and helping clients achieve their financial goals.
good,Very professional atmosphere in a very fast paces environment.  Pay was competitive and benefits were good.  Good opportunity to relocate with the company as there are Ameriprise offices all over the United States.
good,"Since I am no longer employed at this company, I do not feel that writing a review of its atmosphere and work practices is relevant to my current search for new employment."
good,"fun place to work - lots of free lunches, diversity and managment takes lots of continuting education. They don't hire a lot of non-advisory staff but location and people are great."
good,"Ameriprise Financial is a great place to begin a business carer, and get in on the ground floor. It has given me the opportunity to prepare for business and accounting coursework in college."
good,"I had a blast working here and learning things. The leanrlmg and growth I received from here was amazing!"
good,"Work life balance is out of whack lately. Leadership doesn't seem to care about the quality of employee's job satisfaction anymore."
good,I haven't worked for Ameriprise in almost 12 years.  I don't think my experience is relevant to a it's current day environment as things are always changing within companies.
good,Worked as a contractor and hence would not want to comment much.
good,Good job for someone in the financial industry.  I personally did not like that particular industry but for someone that wants to work in that field would be a great start.  Great pay and benefits.
good,"Some days are long, as the work is never urgent. Very low stress, but not much room for advancement if you are not a licensed team member. Overall a decent place to work."
good,"they are very professional "
good,The company was American Express Financial Advisors before the change to Ameriprise. The management changes during transition was disruptive and negated productivity.
good,"work Culture is good, teams are competitive and collaborative, understanding life-work balance is good, good managers and listeners, excellent customers and upstream resources"
good,"The company is great, but poor management of the account manager and frustrated by the partner client instead of dealing equal in the term of contract . No helping much the security officers to feel safe"
good,"Great company, Management is ok they have their favorites and they stick together. They do have good benefits and the people are generally positive in the company."
good,"I liked the firm and the people with whom I worked. It was a demanding job, but also very satisfying. As it turned out it wasn't exactly what I wanted to do."
good,"This wasn't the best place to work.  It was very cutthroat and competitive.  Not really my best working environment.  The managers were very helpful, but it is a financial job...you make the quota or you're out.  I made the quota but decided it was not the type of job I could see myself in for the next five to ten years."
good,"Overall a good company, individual coworkers were good people, very able, but internal communication was really poor, so transition into my job when I arrived did not go well, got started on the wrong foot, so to speak, and never really recovered."
good,Work/life balance was a challenge in middle management but that is present in this type of role with any company.  There are a lot of innovative thinkers in leadership.
good,Working for a small firm is much different than working Corporate where your role is assigned to you and you know the specific tasks or the kind of work you will be doing. Fortunately and Unfortunately at a smaller firm there is no defined role as you will pretty much be doing a little bit of everything. This could be great in that you can really find your niche of what you'd like to do. This is also bad in that you're not able to maximize on one thing you do really well unless if you have the appropriate foundation of staff that will enable you to double down on your strengths. This also comes down to the willingness of the manager / CEO / owner to want to get more staff to support the different functions of the business. You are in a great position if the manager is open to change and different ideas but if not then you may be out of luck and will be looking for a better opportunity sooner rather than later.
good,Full Participation in Town Hall meetings.  Multiple Face to Face with CEO.  Expectiations were clear and measurable which aligned with managers goals.
good,Nice company to work for.  Cares for employees and great culture at office.  Teamwork is wonderful and people work together to solve problems that meet the client's needs.
good,Overall experience was a good one. I worked with third party and offshore resources. My team was global so this gave a great experience for working with a diverse team.
good,Ameriprise was a nice place to work for. The starting pay was fair with room to move up. I didn't care for the culture all that much as it was a bit cut throat for sales.
good,Ameriprise's business model wasn't for me. I'm an analytical person and the business model is made for salespeople. Knowledge of finance is not a prerequisite.
good,management could use some work. needs some help with work life balance. your coworkers are great they create a great culture but management isn't easy to approach
good,"Relatively decent place to work but bad salary structure and too much of over time expected from employees."
good,"*More than $750 billion in assets under management and administration."
good,"Prepared financial transaction forms for meetings, checked forms after meetings for completeness, and followed up on transaction.  Scanned, copied and submitted forms."
good,Learned a great deal of information about the private wealth management industry. It was also interesting to learn about the day to day tasks of a financial advisor.
good,"I enjoyed my internship here, though due to the nature of it being an internship, I was only able to catch a glimpse of the inner workings."
good,"Great lunch breaks, entertainment options, good infrastructure and good work-life balance..overall excellent place to work"
good,"I enjoyed working for Ameriprise and wouldn't mind joining this company again in the near future. I developed not only within my career, but I developed as an individual as well."
good,I worked in the policy change department.  A typical day would consist of answering phone calls from brokers and clients in regards to their Life Insurance policy. I would calculated premiums based on changes they wanted to make. I was also responsible for inputting changes to Long Term Care policies based on a rate increase in each state.
good,"Days are busy with client service issues, financial plan writing and client meetings and follow up.  Company is great about providing up to date information on industry updates and issues."
good,"This company has been bought several times since I have left, and I do not think it is in existence any longer. At the time the company focused on duplication and simple edits for movie studios and advertising agencies."
good,"The more you work, the more money you make.  Management is helpful.  They paid for my series 7, 63 and insurance license.  Job security can be trouble if you cant make sales"
good,"Good work life balance"
good,"When I first started working at Rienas and Brown, I quickly found out how the company worked.With a staff of 7 people, 3 of which were advisor, you really had to be able to adapt to any type of project you were asked to do. If I had to describe the projects I worked on, I would say they all had to do with improving a certain way that they did things. Mainly with technology as opposed to doing things the long way."
good,"This organization is a diversified US financial services company. This company engages in business by its subsidiaries, financial planning, products and services including wealth management, asset management, insurance and estate planning. "
good,"Ameriprise Financial is one of the leading financial planning companies in America. If you are lucky enough to work for an advisor who actually cares, you may be trained and move up quickly. But because its a franchise, there is little oversight as far as staff goes so you could end up with a dud."
good,"I was an analyst and would look through through information given to us by the clients to put into a portfolio."
good,The company offers plenty of opportunities to build leadership skills. The company has a number of different social organizations that any employee can become a member of.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is client education.  It is fulfilling to know that the knowledge I pass on to clients help them immensely in how they manage their finances and how they arrive at critical decisions.
good,"provides customized financial plans, which include insurance, to clients"
good,Nice people and facilities. Half an hour lunch and 10 minute breaks.
good,"Rienas and Brown is a great company, with lovely staff, but there is no growth potential for a full time position."
good,I worked there 20 years ago.  I enjoyed career advancement and salary increases yearly.
good,Worked for multiple financial advisers in Iowa.  Wrote comprehensive financial plans and provided compliance and risk management services.
good,"On a typical day I answer phone calls from advisors that need assistant with either transferring an account to or from Ameriprise or they need asssistance with opening an new account. I learn new things everyday, there's never a dull moment. The hardest thing about my job is trying to decipher what the caller is asking."
good,"- Nice co-workers"
good,"Production, project oriented environment.  Management looks out for themselves, hard to move up."
good,Fast-paced work environment with high quality professionals. Very limited employee development and training.
good,"Answering inbound customer service calls is challenging as call center environments leave little room for autonomy and proactive thinking.  The constant constraints of optimizing call volume is not as fulfilling as providing clients with a sense of trust and security in a manner that caters to the client's personality.  It takes a unique personality to do this type of work for long periods of time.  Face to face interaction, projects that give opportunity to develop better administrative skills are more fitted to someone like me."
good,"Largely worked with clients. "
good,"Worked in the home office for 25+ years.  Encountered many changes, the worst of them being unsuitable mid- to upper- level management.  Witnessed a LOT of butt-kissing (esp females) of these folks.  Obvious that this management group didn't have their own merits to fall back on. "
good,Decent place to work that offers flexible work schedules.  Learn as you go type company.  I learned a lot about serious injuries and the litigation side of a claim.  Great co-workers who are always willing to assist.
good,"A lot of meetings. I learned that the company was inherited, therefore, the company struggles to become world class.( need self starters) Management tows the company line well. Team members are typical some are great some are not. Hardest part is realizing it is much too difficult to be able to help make a difference, you run into a lot of resistance from management. I did like the networking opportunities."
good,I worked as an advisor in the advisor center. It is not a bad place to start working as an advisor. Training is paid for and continued for the 14 months that I was there.
good,"Working in a small envrionment, 2-3 staff can be boring and difficult at times, so client interaction was always exciting. Lots of paperwork and attention to detail were necessary in establishing accounts and managing portfolios."
good,Focused on documentation of form changes and developing database to track amendment mailing responses. There are many product events and system enhancements implemented throughout the year.
good,"Heavy phone work, trading on a phone Que, good training program, Management was not experienced, co-workers were very helpful and friendly. Tied to a strict schedule."
good,I'm not interested in the stock market. This job was not interesting for me. It was basically just an office job.
good,This work experience was good. I really learned a lot from the training program that I have been able to apply to my sales career.
good,Working as a financial advisor is like starting your own business. In order to be successful you must acquire as many clients as possible in a relatively quick time period.
good,"office manager , greeting customers, tons of paperwork and answering phones."
good,"The environment at Ameriprise is happy and hectic!  I enh"
good,No longer hiring for this position...department closed.They only hire for financial advisors.Ameriprise  Auto and home insurance  is now American Family Insurance.
good,"Ameriprise is an amazing company to work for if you're looking to advance your skills and learn corporate culture. You must be open to constant criticism, be willing to endure discomfort to improve your time management skills and you must take it upon yourself to learn more about your benefits and such, as management is incredibly busy with other tasks and may not be able to help much but it's worth the frustration if you're an independent self-starter! Lots of opportunities to grow if you can adjust."
good,"There were always new challenges to conquer. However, sometimes the political landscape got in the way of accomplishing tasks. I would return if the had more remote opportunities. They are not high on remote work."
good,"I enjoyed learning, getting to know and work with a diverse group of people in different areas of the company.  The benefits were also good.  The hardest part is trying to advance within the company."
good,Simple changes that would make work far more efficient were very difficult and lengthy to get implemented. Business partners commonly resistant to change for the betterment of the company as a whole.
good,"Despite the work being quite easy to learn, the manager was in constant micromanagement mode. It was quite a relaxed work environment and a small office so not much interaction with more than 2 other employees. My favorite part of the job was being able to research issues and get them resolved. The most difficult part of the job was not the job itself, but rather, the manager's condescending tone as well as inappropriate comments made while pregnant."
good,"Working in the franchise channel there is a good mount of autonomy, however due to the level of industry fee compression, if you are not associated with a standout team growth will be very difficult."
good,"Like many things, it is what you make of it.  There have been great bosses, there have been less great bosses.  There have been great projects, there have been less great projects.  Some decisions makes sense and some seem very confounding.  It's a difficult company to review in some regards as I've been here for a long time and worked a few different jobs and even the jobs have been different over time."
good,Most contained above. I am retired and miss working. I always enjoyed people contact and the satisfaction of earning a good living. I also miss receiving a weekly or monthly check for a job well done.
good,"It was alright. A little too much micromanaging. Cared too much about the bottom line at times as opposed to what might be best for employees or the customers. It didn't seem to be a sustainable business model, focusing on milking current clients for all they can instead of prospecting new ones. Slow to adapt technology to stay competitive, and the technology they do adapt is woefully inadequate compared to what else is out there.  Management constantly would make changes to everything, from small to large processes, compensation and team structures. They would take input from employees but never seemed to use any of it. Out of touch with where the financial services industry is headed, and out of touch with their employees to a degree. Beyond that, everyone is nice enough and you're able to get along with them."
good,"The managers split the hours between the assistants and the office managers, which is not an ideal situation. The benefits are not the greatest. Positive, career advancement, sponsorship (licenses and certifications)."
good,"I started at Ameriprise Financial in 2009. It has a wonderful staff of people and I enjoy working with each and every one of them.  I have learned a lot about financial preparation, the stock market, investment options."
good,"Layoffs were the norm.  It seemed every year there were staff cuts that were not necessary.  Mgmt did not think through their decisions, but rather reacted to a thought or whim."
good,"It is a very fast paced environment. People are good, culture is good. Advancement is good. Work/Life balance needs work. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with the work."
good,"- Temporary employee/independent contractor"
good,"I have learned to work under stress and deliver my best out of it."
good,"- High Work pressure"
good,"If you get in good with an advisor or two, you're usually fine. Most advisors however are the most needy, demanding, unappreciative individuals who won't hesitate to work you like a dog. The ""voluntary cut-in program"" allows advisors to bonus you, however it's just a way to take the responsibility of paying or bonusing staff off the company itself, as the cut-in comes from advisors paychecks if they even elect to cut you in. You can make a decent bonus though and not feel like an endentured servant trying to learn the industry, if you're lucky enough to work with a good advisor. However, that's up to management who only looks at the production levels of the advisor to determine how many you'll support. Since that's NO indication of how busy you'll be, you can get overwhelmed and for no bonuses."
good,"Overall this is a great place to work for with great benefits, however, I am not an office person so the hardest part of this job was being in a cubicle. Most enjoyable is the location of downtown Minneapolis, the co-workers and the perks."
good,"I took an unpaid internship with Ameriprise Financial during my last semester in college. Of course, no one informed me that my internship should correlate with my majors."
good,I spent most of my time time during a typical day prospecint for new business opportunites. The most challengin part of the job is pursuading a financial advisor to move all of ther business from their existing broker-dealer.
good,"For my technology work pressure is not that much so there is balance in work and personal life . But as its a financial company , there is quite a pressure in Finance deptt."
good,A leadership role supporting advisors to grow their business.  Involved presenting corporate initiatives and helping advisors craft plans to implement these strategies.
good,"Ameriprise has quality leadership and once at Ameriprise there is a lot of opportunity to move up in the company but, at Ameriprise, when you move up you are often giving up more of your time than what the pay increase is worth.  My department that I work for is very transparent in the value I add to the company but I don't see enough of that value return in what I am getting paid.  This is more obvious as I am networking with individuals inside and outside of the organization.  The benefits are getting better every year in terms of Fringe benefits and the health plan is ""ok"".  I know that there are other competing firms that do offer more than the 5% match Ameriprise does for the 401(k) however 5% is still very good.  This company has almost always rewarded hard work and networking in terms of promotions."
good,"You get paid less than market value for your position but they offer benefits both traditionally with PO, Sick time, 401K, and Nontraditional such as different companies that offer discounts to Ameriprise employees. Fast pace is an understatement. If you are blitzing though your day from clock in to clock out and perfectly on schedule for breaks, lunch, ect. If you end up stuck on a call during a break it hurts your metrics and docks against your overall performance. Its full throttle, excessively precise."
good,Managers are well certified and know the industry. Flexible hours. Allow you to work your way up and are willing to train you along the way. Pay needs to be better for Planning Assistants. They do a great share of the work and make much less than the paraplanners.
good,"The lack of consistency coming down the chain, for best practices in certain situations, was unbelievably frustrating. Lack of huddle meetings to guage where employees were at. The manager asked for our issues, and would work on some, but others would be brushed off."
good,Tough job mentally and emotionally. Expected to answer the phone continuously with limited time devoted to off the phone work. High burnout and turnover.
good,"This job varies dramatically depending on the advisor(s) you work with. It can pay very well or very poor and it can be extremely stressful or very low-key."
good,"A typical work day will include arriving to work early to catch-up on industry and firm-related news proceeded by a full day's schedule of holding one-hour appointments with existing clients.  There are various meetings with wholesalers, department leaders, and team members that are scheduled throughout the weeks.  In addition to that, you will enjoy the many non-work related events in which teammates get a chance to participate such as the annual bbq lunch and Christmas holiday dinner.  Ameriprise provides ample volunteer opportunities and is a proud employer of our military veterans."
good,My manager at the time is what ruined the experience for me. Other than that I feel it is a great company with many great people. I learned a lot and had fun.
good,"Corporate workplace culture is very supportive and a pleasant place to work.  Immediate supervisors and colleagues enjoyable to work with.  Everything above the immediate group was quite political.  "
good,I wish I started in this industry at a different time I was just getting my feet wet when the market crashed in 2008. This negatively affected my boss who was paying me as a consultant.
good,The advancement opportunities are lacking but the environment was nice. There was quite a bit of micromanagement but they didn't really bother you if you perform well.
good,"Attend meetings, set-up new accounts on various systems.  Interact with team on problem resolution.  Answer phone calls and review daily email communications."
good,"Good culture, not much room for growth opportunities. Work on the franchise advisor side of the business. Not sure how it differs from the corporate side. Overall a good experience."
good,"Easy going place, Compensation on lower side and no benefits at all. There is job security for sure. No interaction with Mgmt. JOb culture is easy going."
good,Helping out an Financial Advisor is a solid resume building experience for anyone in their first couple years of school. Experience depends mostly on the Advisor. Intern responsibilities were mostly administrative. Good way to see if you have an interest in becoming a financial advisor.
good,"I am a processor with the managed accounts team. Our product is one of the fastest growing investment products in the country right now. I am consistently among the top performers among my peers. During a typical work week I am entering trades, speaking with advisors, estabalishing new accounts, and am the liasion to our offshore team in India. I enjoying the endless amounts of new information that I encounter on a daily basis. The most difficult part of my job is that I am processing too much work. I have set the bar very high and it has allowed other co-workers who are compensated more to do less work."
good,"I was a sales agent for the De Pere, WI Auto & Home Insurance call center for about 6 months. I knocked their quota's out of the park the few moths I was there, but quickly became bored and out of my mind nuts with the repetition of the same call after call after call."
good,Ameriprise is a very accommodating place to work if you are in need of time off etc.. I found it slow and cumbersome due to SEC regulations. This made it hard to get approval for software and technology that was needed. It also made internal review processes slow.
good,I held 4 positions at Ameriprise but there was no more advancing after that. The highest management had no idea what they were doing. Company gave me the chance to get my series 7 and 66 licenses needed to place trades. Lots of networks and groups available to employees.
good,Overall this is a good company but my particular position was very stressful. Pay and benefits were outstanding. Employees were micro managed each and every day.
good,"good place to work "
good,"At the face, this is just like any other large employer, however, while there I knew many people that literally started at the bottom and worked their way up to senior leadership roles.  That is not something that can be said about many other employers."
good,"Very productive throughout the day, greeting clients before their meeting with Advisors. Collect and gather paperwork from clients and input sensitive information into the system."
good,"I had alot of fun working with Ameriprise, although, there is alot of downfalls to this job."
good,Day start with any Company Updates or policy updates. As my goal for this year is finding out new opportunities and over all development in my current process.
good,I enjoy working here but the job is redundant. Very little room for advancement.  After about 1 year of experience you can work from home which saves on transportation costs
good,"-Work life balance"
good,"My boss was great to work with, but there were no benefits.Also, the pay was too low. I learned how to service clients better thru my boss. The workplace culture was good."
good,If you are working toward owning your own book of business this is a great company to help persue your goal. Commission based with high overhead and complaince standards.
good,Extremely fast pace environment and never a shortage things to do in any giving day. I have a great experience while working for this company but would like to see a more competitive pay in term of responsibility level.
good,"A typical day would include:"
good,"I enjoyed this job a lot. However, their communication skills were awful. At my 6 month review and my 1 year I was told I was doing great and doing everything that was expected of me. And at my 1 1/2 year mark they laid me off and said they were expanding my position and I didn't have the skills necessary. They went through (4) receptionists in a 3 year span. I often asked my bosses if there was anything I needed to work on and I was always told everything was great. Clearly that wasn't the case. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the people, and the benefits. But management needs to learn how to communicate better."
good,Very good pay potential. Great people to work with and work for. Everyone there is very motivated. The leaders are all willing to help coach and help you grow professionally.
good,They are modifying everything and they should! Good training though.
good,Ameriprise was a financial planning driven company that allowed there advisers walk over everyone. The management was not good and they did not protect nor valued their employees.
good,A typical day is very stressful. You get pressured into studying outside of work which you are not compensated for. But you are expected to still do it. I would not suggest working here within this role.
good,This is a great place if you like a fast pace that's highly competitive.  It was good for me while advancing my career and I learned to manage a lot while taking care of the people reporting to me.
good,"Ameriprise's cost basis team was a very fast-paced and busy team, learning about all types of securities and account types, very team-based and team-oriented."
good,Good company/good benefits. I've been here for 5 years. One of the best health insurances you can get. My leader is always available for me when I need him.
good,"Under the franchise side, contracts are useless as they may be cancelled or changed at any time.  Benefits are virtually non-existent."
good,"I worked as a personal financial planner for approximately 3 years coming out of law school. It was one of the most challenging experiences of my life. "
good,"At Ameriprise Financial you are an independent Franchise Owner. No base salary, no benefits, no healthcare, no retirement program. With Franchise Ownership you can be as successful as you want to be."
good,This is a strong company with great leadership. Ethical. Strong leadership. Does what it says. Puts the client first. The pay oils be much much better.  However if you want to work as a financial advisor the importance of a strong brand with a great reputation is paramount and Ameriprise has that. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a financial sales position.
good,"It is a professional office and my boss and coworkers are great to work with. I divide my time between scheduling, client correspondence and various administrative tasks in relation to client portfolios. "
good,"Interesting work, but there was a hidden agenda to eliminate a middleware group that caused numerous issues and problems.   This could have been avoided with better management."
good,It was a fun place to work but the management very rarely listened to the financial advisors before implementing changes that were vital to the financial planner role in the AAC.
good,Ameriprise is a great company to start.  The pay does not reflect the additional skills and experience you gain thru your career.  The people are great.  I loved the environment and will miss my co-workers.
good,"The company as a whole is a great company. The Ameriprsie Advisor Center has a lot of opportunity for young advisors to get their feet wet in the industry. The management staff is very closed minded and unable to get in touch with their advisors. They are a new department and are going through a lot of changes, but do not seem to be making progress."
good,"Started with H&R Block Financial Advisors as Branch Manager. Promoted to Regional Sales Supervisor, covering all aspects of sales supervision over multiple regions for the firm. When HRBFA was acquired by Ameriprise Financial, was retained for a corporate compliance supervision post specializing in suitability review of annuity sales also covering multiple regions for the firm."
good,The company is a great place to work under the right management. I have worked there for 16 years and have been promoted from dept to dept and have experienced poor management 95% of the time.
good,The company is a great place to work under the right management. I have worked there for 16 years and have been promoted from dept to dept and have experienced poor management a majority of the time.
good,"Reviewing e-mails,utilizing Microsoft programs such as Word, Excel, Powerpoint. Review and update clients' account profiles,contact clients and follow-up on transactions and pending information,"
good,Company could have been more progressive. Branch office was stuck in the 90's version of giving advice. Subsequently the revenues generated were not sufficient.
good,Job was satisfactory and management was good. All staff was helpful. A great experience got there. I want to get job again there but salary was not satisfied there.
good,If you are fresher its a great company to start with. They really help you grow and modify yourself into a corporate culture. Also employee engagement activities are fun.
good,Ameriprise is a well established financial planning firm with may opportunities to learn about the industry. It's a good place for getting licensed and learning the basics of the job but the job growth is very limited within franchise practices.
good,"Everyday I had to take incoming calls to sell home, auto, and umbrella insurance. My days were long and stressful.  The pay and the benefits were great. I enjoyed most of the people that I worked with."
good,"Great place to work and the people there are fun to work with. Hated the financial sector of the company. The pay is low and in order to move up, you have to pass the financial licencing test."
good,Ameriprise is a very progressive company with a great CEO.  However the local office that I worked in was ran by someone who was very calculating and who played on my emotions to get me to leave so he could replace me with a family member.  I will never forget what he did to me.
good,"This company has been a unit for many years and letting newcomers in is not easy for them.  I really tried my hardest to dive in and be a dependable part of the team, but it seems as if we were looking for difference things out of my employment.  My favorite part of this job was working with the clients.  They are wonderful.  I learned a lot that I will take with me wherever I go.  I loved the actual job, which was maintaining clients' accounts and doing transactions for them as needed.  Documenting everything very well was of the utmost importance, so that if someone else came in behind us, they could see what we had done for the customer previously."
good,"The job started early and lasted late but it was hourly so I didn't mind. I learn to improve Microsoft Office, Excel, Outlook, copying, scanning, faxing and mailing overnight packages. The job was detail oriented which I loved."
good,"I very much enjoyed client interaction in person and by phone.  I did learn that I was not interested in getting licensed and offer advice on investing.  I did like the paperwork and solving client issues.  This was a 4 person franchise and all the other co-workers were licensed.  The hardest part of the job was keeping calendars for 4 people.  "
good,"Nationally respected brand and a pioneer in offering financial planning. I was associated with AMPF as a franchised Advisor. Great home office support, solid technology platform. "
good,The culture does not foster teamwork. Nobody ever really talks or even says hello. The culture is very rigid and not a fun place to work. Not the worst place I ever worked.
good,"Requirement Gathering"
good,"If you love sales and helping people at the same time, this is a great place to work."
good,Its always an opportunity to learn something new.
good,"As an advisor, coming in every morning to a team meeting that rarely changes structure. Constant recaps and kool aid rallies."
good,Good Starting Point for a career. Enjoyed working in a needs based sales environment. Hardest part was being mirco-managed by sales managers who have no idea how to sell.
good,It was a long drive. I never say my kids except for on the weekends.
good,There is a fantastic support systems that allows you to continue your education and still make an impact and succeed in the company. Could not ask for a more caring workplace.
good,"Productive and fun workplace"
good,Good place to work but no opportunity for advancement in this small office.  You receive the training required so previous experience is not necessary.
good,Work culture is great. GREAT COMPANY. I only left because of relocation and the people that work there are great and the work life balance is evened out.
good,"The company is great, but individual teams can be very different in how they do business and treat their employees. The AFA role can be drastically different from practice to practice. Make sure you have a senior advisor who wants to be a mentor."
good,Lots of phone calls supporting internal customers.  Good place to work good internal customers.  Workplace is all good.Minneapolis is a great place to work.
good,"Enjoyed my job "
good,Good people to work with. Clients are easy going. Very laid back place to work. Everyone is provided with their own private office. Learned quite a bit out the financial industry.
good,"Good company.  I was a franchise owner, so I ran my own practice.  All aspects of personal financial planning.  Maintaining client relationships and matching investment ideas with risk tolerance and goals."
good,Company was a franchise I fell like personalities clashed and it was a hostile environment to work in no room for advancement and there was no tuition reimbursement or compensation i
good,"Great company to work with, I would recommend college graduates to start their career in Ameriprise and get the solid grounding needed to be successful in the marketplace"

good,"Ameriprise has decent support programs to facilitate P2 field advisors, however, their home office support is not in line with industry standards.  As an employee of a P2 Ameriprise advisor, the work environment and job duties were much at the discretion of the advisor I supported, rather than Ameriprise's corporate culture.   "

good,"A typical day at work includes working effectively and efficiently to get everything done, Ameriprise has a lot going on and high goals to reach. Management pushes you really hard and most of the time ensures you are rewarded for that. Many of my co-workers are my friends outside of work."
good,"This company is a good company to work for if you are a Finanical Advisor. They are client and money focused, not a bad thing but if you work in a support role they tend to be less interested in your goals and although they do give you recognition for your Advisor's accomplishments, if they are doing well, they don't recognize the efforts you personally make or issues you face if the Advisor is not doing well. In my specific role in Operations, recognition for hard work is rarely noticed. My co-workers were the reason I enjoyed going to work everyday, there is a strong bond with the support staff."

good,Very hard working. Lot of great people. Work life balance is determined up to you. Feel at times you have to over work for your pay. But that can contribute to trying to build your own practice.
good,Ameriprise was a good company to work for. The training thru Home Office was available. Coworkers helped with any needed info or understanding of what the client needed if it wasn't clear.
good,"Although I feel Ameriprise is a decent company to work for, the Franchise I worked for was run by a poor manager  which created an environment that was full of favoritism."

good,Training was paramount with this company and everyone embraced the mission. The talent was groomed and well respected as they were trusted to deal confidentially with clients.

good,"Ameriprise is one of the best company to work for at the early stage of a financial planning career. On the other hand, because of compliance and fee compressions, I believe that RIAs may offer the best environment for the later stage of a career."

good,"Amazing Place to work at, High-level management is supportive, competitive, working conditions are amazing and management is flexible and supportive. But located in Gurgaon and Noida so traveling time is troublesome."
good,"While very conservative and heavily corporate, the environment truly depends on your leader. I've had horrid and I've had great. Overall, benefits are good, not great. (Health club reimbursement, better health assessment benefits, 3 year 401K match as examples.)"
good,"A typical day at work consists of me preparing for the various licenses I have to obtain to be able to become an advisor along with helping with writing financial plans for clients and constructing financial profiles. Furthermore, I worked in Morningstar and NaviPlan daily to prep for client meetings and would sit in on meetings with clients. I learned how to build relationships with clients the proper way and how to best serve them to keep them satisfied during tough financial times. I learned the companies proprietary software on financial planning and daily business operations. My co-workers are great and very supportive and have great attitudes. The hardest part of the job is calming nerves of clients during stressful financial times when they want to move their money and we have to assure them that where we have them is what is best suitable for them. Another difficult aspect of the job is that there is no true training program; it is a lot of self-teaching and figuring things out as you go and is hard to find guidance because the senior advisor is very busy constantly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interactions with clients and building relationships and helping them achieving their financial dreams."
good,Great culture with an emphasis on Lean management.  Currently in a challenging environment however the company has enough capital to look to grow in the near future.
good,Ameriprise is what you make it. If you can manage your time and work properly you can achieve a great work/life balance. Good benefits and people stay at the company.
good,There are many opportunities to educate yourself and others. You are able to help clients feel comfortable with retirement.
good,"My negative review of this company's Advancement and Management was due not so much to the corporation, but due to the great recession which took place after I was employed and we all lost our jobs."
good,"Financial Services is a stressful and demanding industry. At Ameriprise if you accomplish your goals, you are well rewarded. The downside is that it breeds a culture of ""under promise to over deliver"" in chasing down larger chucks of annual bonuses."
good,"I was an assistant to Octavia Serpa. She was a financial advisor for Ameriprise Financial. I would prepare paperwork and documents for Octavia so she can meet with clients. Typical day was:"
good,I would recommend people to be a part of the Ameriprise Family.  They get many options to learn on daily basis.
good,Sales oriented culture with minumum work life balance. I did like that the company taught be a lot about finance and has an EXCELLENT training program. I wouldve stayed with this company if they had a better set schedule. This will be a great starter job for someone out of college but will have to be ver assertive with sales goals.
good,Good Life Work balance and competitive salary. Negatives: Micromanagement
good,Ameriprise Financial a good company to work with.It places 248 among the Fortune 500.The job security is very much there with this company.
good,It was my long term goal to own my won franchise. A chance to grow my business and add associates. unfortunately I obtained my franchise just after my wife's death and prior to the 2008 recession.
good,"The people at Ameriprise are great and fun to work with. The culture, at least in my last position, allowed for the submission of ideas and the opportunity to make your everyday work better through process improvements."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my previous position was having the freedom to work on process improvement ideas I had in addition to my everyday tasks. My leader encouraged me to identify opportunities for process improvements, as well as to document any changes made to our policies and procedures."
good,Day is full with work priorities and a person must learn to multi task quickly. Culture supports a team environment and hardest part of the job is the mutiple level of approvals needed for decisions to be made. Most enjoyable part of the job is being challenged to learn new things.
good,Really laid back atmosphere with small enjoyable field office.
good,"I have been with Ameriprise for about a year now and learn at the very least, 3 different things per day. It has been such an amazing learning experience for me and helpful, too, as I can utilize the information I receive here in my everyday life as well as benefit my friends and familes lives as well."
good,Good place to get your feet wet within Financial Services. Learned at a high level everything to do with personal financial advising.
good,"Loved working there. Nice, diverse working environment"
good,"Building  business and infrastructure with strong controls in a methodical manner is key; large company highly regulated industry so good risk management, compliance and governance is critical"
good,"if you work in the franchise end of the company, it is very location specific.  some locations pay excellent, support employees, etc., others not so much."
good,I spent 7 years with ameriprise growing and learning the insurance industry. I am grateful for the experience I gained. I earned a spot as a top ten customer service Representative. Ranking #7 out of over 200 Representatives. I was listed in their library of excellent calls on multiple occasions. I took escalated calls for over a year while working our resource line for new and tenured representatives
good,"The coworkers are the best part! They make the work feel less stressful, almost like a built in friend. The supervisors are great as long as you're doing your job."
good,"Ameriprise Financial Services did not have many of the perks you listed above, although I did learn alot from them and am grateful. I learned a great deal from the people I worked with."
good,"Solid home office team in Minneapolis. Each individual office around the states is either corporate or franchise so experiences will vary from really good to really bad, or in between. The home offices encourages holistic financial planning."
good,The company is a good company to work for. The people are easy to work with and the pay and benefits are good. It is a challenge to find parking and it is expensive.
good,"Good place to work, but no advancement possibilities.  No increase in hours available.  Six years of employment and experience.  Needed to move forward."
good,Great place to build your career and specially for financial planning focused individuals. Opportunity to advance in supervision and other home office roles if you are willing to travel or relocate to Minneapolis Minnesota
good,"Working at AMPF has taught me how to do to many things. Not many firms like mine have the sheer amount of work flowing in and out of the office like we do, therefore time management is a must in order to do well in this field. Management (at least for my firm) is the only negative thing about my office. My associates are more than willing to help each other when needed, and the people of the office are what make it whole. Due to the size of my firm the only hard part about it is having too much work and not enough people to help meet the demand."
good,"I learned a lot from working at this company, how to be an integral part of a team environment as well as being a successful individual contributor. I feel the most enjoyable portion of my job was interacting with other department members to solve problems and being of service to outside clients."
good,"Project Management standards are well designed and followed, but "
good,"If you like different things everyday, this job is great. I take calls, trades, work on financial planning for over 300 clients. I learned an awful lot about the financial markets and how bonds and equities and mutual funds are all different."
good,"Not enough pto, low salaries and high employee turn overs"
good,"Develop your business with great assistance from company"
good,Typical day of work is meeting with your clients to help them protect themselves and reach their financial goals. Can be very long hours and takes time to build up your account base.
good,"Nice place to work , lots of engagement activities, good growth and scope in future , nice crowd, helping colleagues, but lots of overtime and Saturday working and night shift sucks."
good,Great opportunity to start career when young.  Long hours and lots of prospecting/networking to bring in new clients. Home office provides great support.
good,"The hardest part of the day is fighting with the technology of the systems that are required to work for us to do our day to day duties, which is answering phone calls, and assisting those calls.  Everyday we struggle with the systems being down or slow, or just not working properly. "
good,"When I worked there as an employee I really liked it.  Contracting not so much,  They would hire for 12 months and really only needed you for 3.  Very unstable."
good,"At Ameriprise, you start your day off early so you can be available when the market opens. It is an honest company, and changing everyday to become more efficient and grow. They are a diverse company where every race and religion is welcome. the Hardest part of my day is my managers at my location, because they are not professional. Ameriprise as a whole is very professional. I have learned a wide variety of products and financial planning."
good,very challenging everytime and I have learned a lot and management is also friendly and its enjoyable.All our team memners and including team lead are very friendly.
good,"ameriprise provide a lot of education and training solutions, good benefits and very helpful on trying to create growth. only down side is a lot of high fees clients have to pay"
good,"Ameriprise is a great place to work. The work life balance is remarkable. While there are typical challenges associated with working for a large corporation, all-in-all, I would recommend this as a good place to work."
good,"A good company for freshers to start their career."
good,I work for one of the outside group offices which means I'm paid by the group and not Ameriprise. The Advisors I work for are in my opinion A+ awesome people. Great work environment for me.
good,"Ameriprise has a nice benefit compensation package. They give you a nice cubical, updated software, computers, training, etc. Politics is apart of the atmosphere, so you do need to know how to 'play the game'. Rules and policies are always in flux so you need to 'stay on your toes' plus be able to accommodate to any change. I learned to modify to their change in direction to make shareholders happy and management."
good,"Ameriprise financial was my first experience with sales and specifically financial sales.  It was extremely competitive and after i gained my Series 7, 66 and Life Accident and Health Insurance licenses I successfully completed the training program that over 75% of new hires could not.  I built a book of close to 30 individual clients and managed all aspects of their financial lives."
good,"Ameriprise provides decent benefits and extras for employees to utilize like onsite Health Clinic, Cafeteria, and workout facilities. The work culture really depends on the area within the company. Some areas are a lot more positive than others."
good,"Nice company to work with, nice learning of technologies, attitude of all the people working here is very good.food & cab facility is also being provided"
good,Great company but the work load that they put on their employees is the reason they have 20+% turn over in their claims rolls.
good,"Good work-life balance / integration"
good,"Review calendars and emails of senior leaders that I support, assist with any schedule changes, etc.  Prepare documents, equipment, etc. as necessary for meetings.  Schedule travel when necessary.  Submit expense reports and / or invoices for payment.  The hardest part of the job would be juggling 5 leaders within 3 different departments.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the leaders that I support, assisting them within their respective departments, and getting to work with the amazing people on their teams."
good,"Typical finance company where a financial advisor can learn the craft, but training program is constantly in flux.  Senior advisors are always willing to help with case work, as well as meetings with clients and prospects."
good,Decisions are tough to come by.  Everything is by committee.  The company does provide a good work life balance.  Benefits and time off are great.  It can be hard to get promoted as positions are limited.
good,I worked at Ameriprise as an intern. I'd rate the overall experience as just okay. My bosses weren't there a lot of the time so that was a big con. It was an okay experience overall but wish I learned more.
good,excellent company.  strong financials.  great people to work for.  not a lot of advancement within department.  average salary.
good,"A typical day includes looking at the advisor's calendar to have him ready for meetings. Prepare advisor for meetings including maintaining client accounts. When the mail arrives, any client mail must be scanned, logged on an excel sheet, and then sent to the home office. Analyze market trends and market strategies to ensure that the client can meet their financial needs. Any varied project the advisor has for me is given and must be done on a deadline. Sustain the cleanliness of the office before and after client meetings."
good,"I oversee 5 offices across the Atlantic Region in New Jersey, Pennsylavnia and Delaware. I manage 20 sales assistants and help to develop their training and continued development. I oversee the P&L and help make budget decisions to increase profits. I oversee all operations and compliance in the office to ensure the offices are running smoothly."
good,"I started my career not long out of college with American Express Financial advisors (now Ameriprise). It's been a good 9+ years but with so much change in management structure, it is hard to move up and advance which is what I want. Time for me to take a look elsewhere."
good,"The hardest part of the job is being on a break and lunch schedule, which does not allow you time to participate in company events during the day and network with other groups."
good,"- Daily team meeting, develop financial plans for new clients in morning"
good,"Great Training environment, High Turnover, Long Hours, Learned Alot."
good,"The work well with your schedule (kids, sick, late, Etc).  They do a good job of providing help when needed."
good,"They are great people who are very understanding and flexible. There isn’t any where for growth unless you wish to be a financial advisor . Hours are the same as the stock market, after a year paid holidays but other then that no paid time off."
good,its a good learning experience. first hand look at the industry through the lens of a broker dealer. upward mobility is slim in such a closely owned franchise.
good,Ameriprise was a competitive firm to work for that had a lot of growth opportunity. The culture was strong and cohesive with a strong goals and growth.
good,Productive and very busy with meetings taking about 60% of the day. On the whole it s a great company to work for. The work gets done and everyone is accountable for what they are expected to do.
good,"Ameriprise provided the resources for learning the financial advisory business, a good platform of products and services and an excellent compliance department and training."
good,"This job is OK if you like working a desk job with no real challenges.  The job was not bad, but I could not stand the drudgery.  Management is OK and the people are nice."
good,"-They pay for all your licenses"
good,this was a day to day environment that was fast paced and knowledgeable for me. I love to learn and exceed in my profession and career.  No 2 days are alike.
good,"Manager retaliated upon me filing a formal complaint against him through Human Resources.  He was very verbally aggressive and abusive towards me which caused me great anxiety and stress.  He was unapproachable and horrible to work for and with.  He managed by fear and intimidation.  And, his staff was fearful of him."
good,Stressful days. I have learned how to manage my desk and phone. My leader is the best one I have ever had.The hardest part of the job is the dealing with the stress. You cannot have a great work life balance. I do not feel like we are paid enough for the work and stress we have to deal with.
good,Seriously good pay and benefits. Had difficulty myself sitting at a desk all day with such limited ability to move around. Calls could be stressful and long sometimes but you work with some really great people and there's a lot of opportunity to move around in the company.
good,"Ameriprise Financial is a solid company and corporate citizen. Employees can expect to be treated with respect and dignity and advance their careers if they are motivated to create and manage their individual development plan. "
good,"Typical internship, the pay was low but so were the responsibilities. My manager was very friendly and treated me fairly. There was enough work to stay busy, but not so much that I ever felt overwhelmed."
good,Ameriprise Financial is a professional organization and works within the FINRA Rules. Employees must be aware of their actions and interactions with clients to remain with in FINR guidelines.
good,Was a great place to work with the culture and people around you.My position got very strenuous during tax season and work life balance was an issue. Pay could have been better as well.
good,The environment was not bad. There is a lot of teamwork and collaboration with the offshore team. We a had a fast pace environment but was not stressful.
good,Typical day mostly performed administrative duties. Enjoyed the client base. Boss was very understanding of unexpected family issues that arose. Learned a lot in my time there.
good,If you like a fast pace environment this is the place for you. Ameriprise is always moving and changing and the majority of the time for the better. Most of the managers are fantastic and the company is great if you want to learn more and move up. I'm not so sure the compensation was always fair. I believe as a woman I was paid less than fellow men and I believe I was underpaid for the work that I did. The reason I was there was because of the wonderful people I worked with and the reason I left was the compensation.
good,"I spent the typical day by responding to client requests,  working with advisors on various fiduciary duties, and completing routine file maintenance."
good,"*Very small office environment"
good,The Case Load Is A Little Heavy at Times. I Would Say That Management Doesn't Listen To Their People. They Treat Them As Though They Are Disposable. The Employees Seem Reserved And Not Warm At All And Information Is Sparingly Given Out. I Would Say Their Tech Is Advanced And Really Good Stuff But Their Management Team Is Absent.
good,"Good place to work. Very good people and culture. Lots of opportunities for advancement. However, some of the managers are poor. Main problem is lack of loyalty."
good,"Ameriprise is a great place to work.  They offer many different employee programs and networks, benefits, and a great culture.  I even recommended and have now my father working at Ameriprise"
good,"On the day to day I took between 30-50 inbound calls for internal callers. My boss was not very effective at assisting with issues on the daily grind, but the job was overall not bad. It is a very welcoming place and everyone on the floor wants to support you and your career and willing to answer questions."
good,Ameriprise is a good company to work and grow with good environment. Depending on your direct leaders you career growth may vary. They will provide perks like subsidized food and cab facility.
good,"Its a good company to work with, the work culture is good but the biggest drawback is there is no work life balance and long work hours. If you do not have a problem with this then its a great company to work with."
good,No COLD calls!!! The hours are not very family friendly especially in the beginning. There is a scheduling selection 4x a year based on Sales/Compliance/Quality. Benefits are top notch! Company in general is a solid company.
good,"Great Management, just not in a position to make decisions between FA's and staff. Cared about staff and was always willing to listen and appreciated them."
good,"a typical day at work will require us to schedule appointments with clients to discuss money management options into a 401k, mutual funds account, or stock options. I learned how to teach myself and others to manage money. Management was decent as so was workplace. hardest part is receiving referrals. most enjoyable was making money"
good,Ameriprise Financials is a good upcoming organization where you can start your career.  there is a lot of work which is good for growth and knowledge.
good,"Fast paced demanding job. Client service phone calls and continuous amounts of paperwork for the advisors practice."
good,Great place to work. Great salary/bonus structure. Trouble with advancement though. Would recommend to others. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"1.Communicating with clients was very enjoyable"

good,I worked for them for over 35 years and it was great.
good,Overall Ameriprise is a great company to work for. Everyone is very friendly and I have a great team to work with. The most enjoyable part about working at Ameriprise is my job and co-workers.

good,Had good share of my experience at AMPF. Good place to start your career or to climb the lader. Less stress and leaders are actually leaders except one. Rest you will learn great things at work there.
good,Typical office environment.  Senior Advisors have individual offices.   Junior advisors and support staff have the standard cubicle setup.  The office environment went from quiet to loud depending on how advisors were in the office each day.
good,Nice place to work. Work life balance is maintained. Job security is also there. I worked there for 3 years and 8 months. Senior management is also good.
good,Good company to work for especially if you are young eager and willing to work hard. You will be sucessful and really enjoy the people. Lots of ways to recognize and be recognized. Very kind with buying food for occasions.

good,typical day involved answering phone calls. I learned about stocks. Management was great.  Workplace was relaxed.  the hardest part was understanding the market.  The easiest part was scanning documents.
good,"I loved working here. It was a fantastic work environment with great coworkers and great bosses. However, there was no real path for advancement within the company. That is the main reason for my departure."
good,"I could honestly say I loved my job. Had a great work ""family."" Great benefits. Former leader was the best! Enjoyed being a SME for many things. Great downtown location."
good,This company is a great place to start out on a path for financial advising and financial planning. Its a long road to start making a good income to support ones finances.

good,The only reason I left was to pursue a career that Ameriprise was not currently hiring for.  I enjoyed working there very much and learned a lot.  I would recommend it.
good,"I enjoyed being around my coworkers at Ameriprise, and saw meaning in my work. I worked mostly at the front desk, where I answered phone calls and organized data in Excel. I also organized files. All of this was beneficial to the financial advisors I worked with."
good,"AMPF provides a good work/life balance; easy to leave your work at work. Compensation can be lacking, though; they tend to hire from within, so many people have started from the phone queues, but that helps them keep salaries lower than most like."
good,There is so much to learn at Ameriprise and I can't say there is really a typical day.  There are some great opportunities if you are up for the challenge.
good,Ameriprise is an interesting place to work.  The work is challenging and ever changing.  No two days are alike as clients all have different and varying needs of service.

good,"Ameriprise has many employees willing to teach those that wish to learn, provides a quality benefits package, and is clear about its brand, values, and mission.  People who work at ameriprise tend to stay there, so those of us that wish to advance do not always have the option."
good,I was with the company for near 17 years and I like it.  They had a great balance of work and family and they really invested in their employees.  They had great advancement at the company.

good,Being a contractor is difficult at Ameriprise. I think the permanent employees love it here - contracting is different. At least on the team on I on. I would probably take a permanent position here if it were on a different team/project.

good,Balanced work life home schedule in most areas.  overall good place to work.  Salary is average and benefits above average. Flexible work schedule.  Financially stable company with long term strategy in place.
good,"There were high expectations for the  Admin Assistant to the Field Franchise VP.  Very fast paced environment, once behind it was difficult to ""catch up"" because deadlines were quick and new assignments were always coming.  If your are extremely organized you will do well.  If you get distracted easily or try to go ""above and beyond"" you'll fall behind in your duties because most days there isn't time for that.  Don't overstep your boundaries....  do your job and provide the info requested.  Some creativity permitted in creating the monthly and weekly newsletters."

I typically spent the day studying for the required licensing exams in order to start as a Financial Advisor in the industry. I would also, sit in on client meetings, taking notes, help with client paperwork and appointment scheduling. I had no other co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the solitary environment.The enjoyable aspect was that the job offered a ton of potential for upward movement and pay increase, for someone who had the ability to be comfortable in that work environment."
good,Requires a professional demeanor. Multi-tasking is a must with the ability to remember large quantities of information. Income is varied depending on your own performance.
good,"The nice thing about Ameriprise is that you can tell that leadership really wants to take care of employees.  There are good benefits, great PTO, and they really push for leaders to take care of their people (the ""terrible boss"" that you hear others talk about is rare).  That being said it's a very conservative culture (similar to many highly regulated firms) which can feel stuffy at times."
good,"The people are awesome to work with.  Management works hard and yet finds time to help you with your development.  A typical day at work is seeing how much you can get done in a day.   Keeping up with the pace. "

My work day consisted of managing my client base through: client appointments, processing business with the assistance of staff, handling home office issues via telephone and staff, answering client issues via phone, continuing education classes, meeting with staff and business partner to plan.

The job itself can be stressful and upper management definitely has high expectations on where things are improving and looking to create a Lean environment as much as possible.
good,"They have great development opportunities in place such as online courses, job shadowing, mentoring opportunities, etc. I'd say that development is definitely encouraged here. Benefits like health, & vacation are ok compared to what I had elsewhere but sufficient."

good,"Working for the company has taught me a lot about personal financing, time-management and enjoying my job! At times it was stressful...it's finance, what do you expect. The company has a development plan that can pull you in so many directions depending on what your career goal is.

good,I loved the opportunity there. It was very competitive and well suited for the 'go getter' type. It involved the ability to remember alot of different policies and regulations which was more difficult for me. There was a lot of micromanagement and no real structure to the hierarchy.

With several deadlines (market open and close), urgent client requests, day-to-day administrative tasks, compliance requirements, etc... my day can go in several different directions in a matter of five minutes.  It is important that client emails are responded two within 10-20 minutes, the phones are answered in two rings, and clients are greeted in person with a smile.  Our team is small and in close communication, we each have our established roles and have daily team meetings to fill one another in on what is going on in our world each day. The hardest part of the job is coming to terms with the fact that you are not going to be able to complete your task list each and every day and that the work will be there in the morning.  The most enjoyable part of this position is the constant learning, challenges, and management.  I love figuring out complex issues, new learning opportunities, and thoroughly enjoy working for my boss and working with my officemate."

good,"Trading, Operations, distributions, new accounts, service of accounts, client sales"
good,Working at Ameriprise was a very rewarding job. I loved being able to help clients with there auto and home insurance when they had questions or changes that needed to be made. The call volume when I was employed was higher than normal so after ending one call another one would immediately come in. Because of the high call volume I worked a large amount of overtime to help the company. My co-workers were very fun and friendly. If I every needed assistance or had a question they were always there to help. The hardest part about this job was working with such high call volume and having to tell clients information they didn't want to hear. Being patience and staying calm is very important. The best part about this job was being able to help customers with any questions or issues they had and making them happy. Knowing that I was able to effectively assist them at the end of each call.

It was a very busy environment and senior management didn't seem to care much about the hours worked, but they also reward you  very well if you work hard and add value to projects/goals.  There is definitely a connection between your performance and your compensation.  "
good,Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance values its employees and shows this by the employee appreciation events and the benefits & compensation awarded to the employees.

good,"Served as an intern for the summer. Great place to work and good management. Received plenty of one on one time with upper management and spoke with executive members within the company. Overall, enjoyed my time at the company and would recommend it to a friend."

good,worked multiple positions in in my 23 years.  I would love to explaine through the details of may many positions throughout the 23 years at IDS/American Express/Ameriprise Financial.
good,"Ameriprise is a great place to work,so long as you keep your stats up to par. It's a call center so expect to take call after call - this isnt for everyone."
good,Working within a franchise practice of Independent Financial Advisors and clients helping service and meet their financial needs.  I complete any and all activities that do not require licensing along with trade activities under the direction of the financial advisors.
good,Ameriprise goes the extra mile to train their employees and make sure they have the resources available to make the best suggestions to our clients for their financial well being.
good,"I worked at corporate headquarters and for a franchise advisor and my experience was different for both."
good,Management is very helpful.  They treat people very friendly. All the employees from top to bottom have same respect amongst them. They have defined goals and objectives clearly.
good,There is a lot of room to move up within this company. The compensation was great and the only reason I am leaving is because I am relocating to be closer with family.
good,"Ameriprise Financial has been a great place to work, the staff is professional, kind and always ready to lend a helping hand, sharing information, and care about their clients!"
good,"Hired to be a financial advisor, but then Ameriprise switched to a team based approach instead of having individual advisors build their own books of business in the AAC.  Effectively this dumped the new hires into the lowest position on the team which is expected, but when you are hired to do something else and then are told that is not what you  will be doing a week after starting to work their it is not a fair thing for an employer to do, especially when taking a huge pay cut.  Welcome to corporate America I guess.  The opportunity for advancement is definitely present but few will stick around to be telemarketers for a year making 200 dials a day calling people that don't want to be called before being promoted to an actual appointed advisor role."
good,"Ameriprise Financial is one of the leading diversified financial services companies in the U.S. Ameriprise Financial provides a wide range of financial planning, products and services designed to be utilized as solutions for its clients’ cash and liquidity, asset accumulation, income, protection, and estate and wealth transfer needs, including wealth management, asset management, insurance, annuities and estate planning."

good,"I loved my time at Ameriprise because you are able to set your own pace, and the company has tons of benefits. The advisors go on big company trips that are performance based, so it is very motivating."
good,"Everyday is fun to be in the business of serving clients. However, I wish the compensation structure was better for new advisor's entering the business. and what about being an RIA partner?"
good,"I learned a lot about finical analysis. There is a good work culture at Ameriprise. As an intern, they exposed me to project work and presentations to a large group."

good,"The only hardest part of the job i night shift."
good,"As a regional case manager, I provided thorough case assessments and follow up to ensure regional advisers and their clients are well informed on the proprietary products as well as the process to procure them.  Consistency and the utilization of best practices highly contributed to my success within this career.

I partnered closely with neighboring region associates and the underwriting team in order to streamline the procurement process and elevate productivity.  "
good,"At Ameriprise Financial, I truly felt a part of the team.

good,"They stressed training, and made sure everyone had all the training necessary to succeed.  We would bounce ideas off of each other trying to figure out how to best help our clients.  The hardest part was remembering all the laws and regulations as you wanted to make sure you did your due diligence for legal reasons and the best interest of the client.  The best part of the job was working downtown, and with all of the amazing colleagues."
good,"The Agents are all very nice people. This job is for a person who can lead and take control of the office. They must be self motivated and work independently. At time you are alone and bored in the office. No traffic at all, so you see no one but the agents."
good,"This is a great company to work for. The work environment is healthy & supportive. The benefits they offer are one in a million. "

good,Lots of strong personalities to deal with some of the individuals tough to deal with little guidance until after the fact.
good,"The organization is phenominal, and executive leadership has the right strategy in place, doing things the right way.  However, regional leadership is unqualified for their role and struggles to understand how to lead other leaders.  Micro-management and control are at the core of the issues."
good,"Poor management and training. Different deal for each employee so as long as you are receiving all the perks, is a great job but a few sharks at the top that will kick you down with pleasure. Be careful swimming these waters."
good,"A typical day at work would involve answering phones, servicing customer with their statements/accounts, money movement, using document developer to update SPS accounts, typing letters or correspondence.

good,I was a franchisee sold practice best training in the industry I'm completely angry at indeed to require me to write a book on a company I worked with ten years ago REALLY
good,Good internship. I was only there for a month. I worked with marketing director and front desk receptionist. Nothing bad to say about the office environment or company.
good,"Very very micro managed. Treats like a kindergartner! Always looking over your shoulder and have to speak their language. "
good,"People were nice. Had access to a computer and handled all appointments for financial adviser, files, and much more. I worked two days for financial advisor.

good,Very insightful. Learned a lot about the day to day operations and really dove deep into the basics of financial planning.  I loved the flexibility of the job.
good,It was a good job to have at the time.  Working closely to an advisor gave me a good skillset to continue with.  I learned about how to effectively deal with people.
good,Really good team and over all management. A good company to start your career and get chance to  learn lots of things. Lots of opportunities are given to grow oneself.
good,"You are stuck in the same position until you leave. Pay is good, no benefits and low pay raises. If you like spending most of your time doing nothing this would be the job for you."
good,"the opportunity at this employment was very good"
good,"Slow paced"
good,"A typical day was seeing what was on the agenda for that day. I learned how to manage my time and make sure that my work corresponded well with others, management was nice and easy to get along with. The culture was relaxed but knew to be serious at times."
good,"It's hard to write a negative review when I worked for an independent firm and they don't necessarily represent Ameriprise as a whole.  I felt there was no upward advancement, but that was only at my current location and it might be a totally different experience at another firm."
good,typical day at work was preparing for client meetings and having the client meetings then correctly documenting the meeting with a follow up email to the client.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my various roles at Ameriprise was my ability to learn about the various aspects of technology. Overall, Ameriprise provided me the foundation to elevate my career to where it is today."
good,"It has been a “GREAT “opportunity. I equate it with trying out for the New England Patriots. They are the best team in the NFL and to just have the opportunity to try out is a great reward.  I found out somethings about myself that will only make me better and I realized somethings about me, that made me proud. “ …………But people will never forget how you made them feel”.  Thank you."
good,Low stress; challenging place to work. Culture varies across offices. Management is generally competent. The pay varies widely across job function but tends to be below-average.
good,I cannot provide a full review for this company. I was an Intern and did not get to experience the full effect of what it is like to work there full time.
good,"Ameriprise Financial Planners often have highly professional and attractive environments.  Their training to give ethical and high quality service in the best interest of their clients, creates a friendly, balanced atmosphere despite the fluctuation of stock markets and their clients' personalities."
good,"Dedicated to committed work and enthusiastic to learn new technologies and methods. "
good,I do not recommend working here. their is no trust among staff. and their is a horrible lack of community. The partners are to money focused. and that is the culture of the business.
good,"I worked at Ameriprise as an intern for 2 months. I greatly enjoyed my experience and took a lot of value from it. My boss was a wealth of knowledge, and we would talk every time I went in. She would fill me in on the business and how things were going, problems she was having as well as things that were going well for her. My job was to manage her social media accounts, through a program called GoSocial. This was a learning experience, as you could see how posts grew her followers and the type of engagement you get from those posts. That was the hardest part of the job yet at the same time was the most enjoyable, because managing social media is not as easy as it seems, but with the right angle it can be a lot of fun."
good,"Performed IMAC procedures for new employees and upgrading current workers.  Used Service Now Job Ticketing to track work assignments.  Used ServiceNow SCCM and Active Directory system to configure the systems.  Configured and placed the new employee systems at their locations before their starting date. For current workers, configured their new computer, migrated data from existing computer to the new system, and with appointment, exchanged computers to deliver their new computer. Installed RAM into systems; added software to existing systems via network “Push” procedure."
good,My favorite thing about Ameriprise Financial is that they have the most CFP holders of any financial planning firm in the USA. This illustrates their moral and legal obligation to put the client first at all times.

good,"Nice company to work for. Good people and a very understanding management. Great colleagues. Ready to help. Overall, a great company"
good,A large company with many possibilities to advance your career. A national company with opportunities to relocate throughout the country.
good,I worked in a small office of Ameriprise with 2-3 other people so most days were very quiet. Everyone was respectful but many days could be very slow and seem to drag on.
good,"I have been with Ameriprise Financial for 2+ years now and have experienced many benefits of working for a large, well-known, and respected financial company in a tough industry. I started as a Customer Contact Professional assisting advisors, advisor's staff, and clients with Ameriprise processes for changing ownership on accounts, adding/updating beneficiaries, managing through a divorce, and estate settlements. I had to be knowledgable on all Ameriprise Products and several different processes. I am currently working as an HR representative which is allowing me to experience a different aspect of the company. I currently assist advisors, advisor's staff, and employees with any questions they have regarding company benefits and payroll. I have been more than pleased with my co-workers and leaders. I feel Ameriprise Financial has a strong moral stance in the financial industry and we are a respected company which means a lot to me. I am always proud to say I work for Ameriprise Financial."
good,Good place to learn the financial planning business.  Working for an independent advisor does not provide great benefits though.

good,A five star place to work! Great people to work with.  Ability to create a schedule that works for you.  It's a large company so you learn quite a bit about how to create an ongoing structure and product that goes beyond you.
good,"Working at Ameriprise was an awesome experience.  The financial advisers were extremely helpful.  I sat in on conference calls, webinars, and seminars on a weekly basis.  I learned about bond yields, riskier markets, IRA's, and much more.  I also had some time with BlackRock's Social Security Calculator and analyzed various financial plans."

good,Great work environment if you are into learning about the industry. I received no benefits but it was my first of out of college so I guess it's understandable.
good,"It was a great company to work for. Compensation and benefits for my positions were decent. They really pay more based on education above experience externally. I was with the company for 3 years and the culture was a very corporate environment. A climb the latter, brown nose, and rub elbows with style of business."
good,This job can be very fast paced but once you get the hang of it the time flies.  You can learn something new everyday and they encourage you to continue learning the business.
good,"Client Service, applications, database, many different computer programs always changing, detailed work - requires a good memory and understanding of financial compliance issues."
good,"I think that Ameriprise Financial is a great place to work. I spent nearly 15 years there, and if there had not been a differing of opinions on something I would still be there until the day I retired! The CEO of the company is a great person and an example that all leaders there should endeavor to emulate. He is honest, fair, consistent and genuine."

good,Worked for a franchise advisor who did not offer benefits. Job allowed for flexibility for illnesses and childcare. Enjoyed the position and the ability to learn new job functions and new software.
good,Ameriprise Financial is a great place to work with tons of opportunities and giving to charity. They have a lot of fun events to keep their workers engaged. The department that I was in just had poor management and the customers calling in were sometimes rude. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers with a non-supportive team.
good,"I enjoyed very much working there until about 2 years ago ,when advisor Constantly was changing ways and started to make it miserable to go to work never new what was happening and left in dark in which never was before. Always new what was going on and what you were to expect."
good,"As a financial advisor, you are working 7 days a week.  I did very well and I thank this company for providing me with the tools I needed to be successful individually and as a team.  While the staff and tools provided are tremendous, it requires very self-motivated individuals to be successful."

good,It's a great place to learn and get industry knowledge. Management does a great job of leaving you to your work (as long as your getting the job done).
good,Nice place to work. I essentially did the same work that an advisor does. Most enjoyable part of the job would be to sit in client meetings. The hardest part of the job was creating compliance letters
good,Retail financial sales can be very rewarding but also very demanding. American Express FInacial Planner/Ameriprise Advisors was a great learning platform with a great leadership/management model.
good,"Progressive Company, always updating their website and passing innovations onto advisors and staff. Each Ameriprise office is individually owned (franchise). Business applications are turned in and company sends paycheck to advisors every two weeks. If you are clerical and want to become a selling advisor, the company will train you."
good,The company offers good salary package and benefits. Job stability could be one however its everywhere so we have work to make ourselves involved and be with the business.
good,"Working at Ameriprise Financial as a Financial Advisor is not your typical 9am to 5pm. My direct management is my two business partners and most of the learning is done on the job as you meet with and prospect for clients. The majority of your time is spent creating customized wealth management and risk mitigation strategies while providing ongoing client service. The hardest part of the job is prospecting and marketing for new clients in order to build a client base and recurring income. The most enjoyable parts are the incredible flexibility, the ability to make a very high income, and the overall satisfaction of taking care of a clients needs."
good,Training was great. Team was great. Supervisors need to be trained in the field they are trying to manage. You cannot have a client service supervisor oversee Sales when they have no experience.
good,"My one advisor was awesome.  However, the second advisor was very stressful to work for.  I will miss working here.  The coworkers of the other advisors in the office are a great group."
good,"I am very grateful for my job and the company as a whole is great, I am looking for more growth and learning opportunities outside of the financial corporate industry. It is repetitive and not very challenging, over time the complaceny can get to you as opportunities for advancement are not readily available."
good,"Loved my time at Ameriprise. Great solid company. You really do learn a lot of skills that make you very marketable. You are expected to perform at your highest level, which is not bad. Economy does effect the job security."
good,A typical day at work began with assisting current clients with establishing various accounts to plan education or retirement costs. This tied in to creating financial plans for customers
good,"I work for a franchise of Ameriprise Financial. I am not paid well, but no one is in the financial planning field. (Ironic, I know) My boss is great, but it is just him and me in the office. Other franchises are run differently and you will want to ask about how the franchise runs compared to other franchises."
good,"Great pay and wonderful benefits! The people are awesome and very helpful. They really focus on the right things here that drive the bottom line, which also can be a buzz kill as it does not incentivize creativity."
good,Great group of talented and dedicated co-workers whose primary focus is providing the best possible ongoing client experience.  Advisor is very good at what she does.
good,"I can only speak regarding the individual franchisee I worked for, as I was a part of a branch office, but I adored the time I spent here. My boss was very accommodating to my schedule regarding my son, very patient, and made me feel like family. I hated having to leave, but I moved to a different area and needed a shorter commute."
good,Company is currently looking to ship more jobs to India and I want to ensure I am not caught off guard so I am looking for another position elsewhere.
good,Good place to work. No benefits though. Hours were great. Great boss. Great people in building. Quiet setting. Close to home.

good,"Typical days start from 10-6, depending on the advisor you work for.  "
good,"It's an extremely nice place to work at.I have no problem at all, in working there."
good,"I learned so much about the financial world working for this employer. I worked under one of the brightest financial advisors who taught me about the stock market, insurance, and retirement/financial planning. As his administrative assistant I kept his schedule in order, his paperwork organized, his calls and messages organized, and ensured a pleasant client experience. After a few months I became his marketing coordinator and was responsible for organizing client events, seminars, and editing/delivering media used for advertising."
good,Didn't work here for long but the time there I was able to grasp a lot of good things about the working field and get a feel for the accounting field.
good,I love this company. Great benefits and work life balance. Ameriprise pays well and provides lots of potential growth.
good,"Its a nice experience with Ameriprise. I worked on 3 different projects in 6 months. Challenging but interesting ones. Mobile App is new to me. So its a new experience for me. I never been into this area earlier, i heard a lot cold and challenging climate. Now i am done with Ameriprise and started searching new exciting opportunity."
good,"Was a culture of excellence and active learning, where you were held responsible in your actions. The organization worked as a team and communicated ideas off on another to make the best decision."
good,"Standard office environment and culture. Each branch is its own beast and so general reviews probably aren't that helpful unless one is applying for work in the home office. That said, the level of disclosure and communication from home office is excellent, as is the availability and access to resources for market and product education."
good,"Ameriprise communicated well with several different departments and it was a collaborative company."
good,"Company promotes a good work like balance and offers great benefits.  If you show up on time, pay attention and be focused it is a great place to work."

good,"Training lacked structure. However, the office had a family feel. Enjoyed working with my co-workers. Fund selection was not always in the best interest of the clients."
good,"The work journey here is tremendous, work culture is magnificent. Support from seniors and the company itself makes you feel really good."
good,"good culture and advancement in benefits and very good work culture and growth and full support.  Happy working at this company , learnt a lot career wise."
good,Learn a lot handling the technical part of the job and also in building and maintaining the relationship between the local office and corporate.
good,"Learn, learn and learn more. I love the fact that working here taught me time managment skills. Because the work was so tough it forced me to believe in myself a lot more"

good,The company has added top tier technology to leap-frog other financial firms that provide targeted investment advice to its clients. Investment research is deeply insightful and first rate. Company strives for 100 percent risk compliance and integrity of all operations.
good,I currently work at Ameriprise through Insight Global.  It is a fast-paced organization that expects its' employees to know their occupation well.  It is not a place to learn your skillset but moreover to know it well and apply it.  I found the management to be very accommodating and helpful.  Communication was excellent and there was very little Siloing.
good,Loved my time here although it only last two weeks. (Temp job) I was an assistant that worked mainly on file maintenance and organization. Loved the staff.
good,The environment was amazing. Everyone was supportive and helpful. I was only an intern but I learned a lot and found it fun and guiding for my future.
good,Advancement opportunities only exist nationwide thus career advancement in Charleston is nonexistent.  Overall culture is progressive and employee focused.  Training and education is top tier.   Flexible with schedule.   Great benefits.
good,"I was lucky to have a good boss for the short time I was there. Wish I was there longer. "
good,My schedule was a very relaxed easy 9-2 schedule. I had a nice office right on the water. I was able to make my coffee and then check emails and set up appointments for clients. All the clients that would come in were very friendly and they all had stories to share. A very enjoyable work day.

My main priority everyday is client confidentiality and monitoring compliance with every task I complete.  I spend talking with clients and working with the financial advisor I work with.
