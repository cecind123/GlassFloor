bad,"nustar linden management is unreliable, uneducated, harassing, bullying, career ruining, egotistical. management has threatened employees. discipline runs rampant for no reason. managers have given bad recommendations for former employees to potential new employers to keep them unemployed. management lies thru their teeth. plant manager accepts graft (paid for trips, dinners, ""white envelopes"") from contractors to guarantee they get the proposed jobs. nustar hr has been told numerous times of the situation and does nothing to fix the problem. you are forced to donate minimum 1% of your pay and only are a good employee if you donate 3%. hours are long. requested time off is rejected. forced to work anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks consecutive. supervisors are chastised by plant manager if they dont crack the whip on operators. worst place to work for. how they ever snowjobbed fortune magazine is beyond me. employees give good reviews to avoid management and corporate harassment."
bad,"I found the position to be a good opportunity, however a little too good to be true. The lack of professionalism and black leadership experience for those in charge clearly made for a sink or swim environment."
bad,"This is the most unorganized, ridiculous place to work. It's a joke. PPE has to be begged for. The lead operator is petty and condescending. Everything is ""tomorrow"" or ""soon"". When you can understand his broken English. Training department is laughable. Extreme favoritism towards contractors (which happen to be lead operators family) NO chance of advancing at this plant. Incidents go unreported. Strict dress code, tattoo policy. Management also strongly suggest you donate money to non profits even though you're working poor. And the volunteer hours are mandatory.. Contradicts itself, I know."
bad,"Worked at NuStar Energy full-time for more than 8 years"
bad,The benefits were great but at the end of the day I was not impressed with the lack of communication and leadership displayed by the Directors and VP's.

Hard times tend to define a companyâ€™s true culture and during these times, the field locations maintain the strong culture."
good,One of the best companies to work for they take very good care of their employees. I wish that they still owned the refinery. I hated to see them sell it.

good,"I get to work between 7:50 and 8:00 ,I go to my desk and check my notes that I left from yesterday .I get lunch at 11:30 to 12:30 with my co-worker. Lots of times I check my project with my manager during 1:00 to 2:00 . I get home between 5:00 and 6:00."
good,Company runs a very lean staff.  Too much oversight for work that needs accomplished.  Great company to work for with a great vision just understaffed.
good,A great company to work for with amazing people and atmosphere. There's no place like it in the city. They don't hire on full time very often so that might be the only negative.
good,"Manage and coordinate shift activities with supervisor."
good,I would absolutely recommend NuStar to friends and others looking for employment.  The atmosphere is nearly stress free and the people here make it fun to work here. There is for advancement and training is always available. The NuStar culture is my first corporate experience in many years and I was not sure how i was going to adjust coming from Seagate and LSI. But the people here made the transition easy and fun.
good,"Nustar is great if you are an actual employee but I was only on contract. The benefits seem amazing and the people here are great. They treat contractors like part of the family but when the work runs out, they will quickly let you go."
good,NuStar is a great company with great benefits from the bonuses to the free lunches and everyone works as a team from the lowest man on the totem pole to upper management!!
good,"I perform a variety of tasks during a typical day to inlude imaging computers, monitoring network systems, installing printers, resetting user passwords, etc..."

good,"24/7 bulk storage terminal operation with operations, personnel, EHS, and customer service responsibilities. Learned budget process and forcasting of maintenance/capital projects."
good,Really enjoyed my job!!  Executive management to involved in day to day operations not allowing middle management do their jobs.  Highly encouraged to participate in outside programs and donations.  Confidential does not mean confidential.  Favoritism was over the top.

good,I absolutely loved working at NuStar Energy. I was so sad to leave my team when it was time for me to re-locate to another city. Everyone is very nice and there are many onsite perks.
good,"I loved my time here.  They are very family oriented.  Everyone works together to get the job done.  Nobody every says, ""That's not my job!"".  I love that. I wished the contract could have been extended.  If you can get your foot-in-the-door, take it.  The benefits are great for full-time employees."
good,Did an internship here and really enjoyed the work culture!
good,"Nustar cares for their employees and their employees families! They encourage volunteering, A one team one goal atmosphere!! Everyone is important no matter your role. Management cares about you not just  Lower management, From CEO down everyone is approachable and caring."

The management were excellent, I learned a lot about oil and the holding facilities. my coworkers were great and very helpful. the hardest part of the job was the long hours but the most enjoyable part was the wages and schedule"
good,Work from 8am-5pm with a 1 hour lunch break give or take depending on the reason. Daily activities included working on my regulatory based projects and helping my boss revise emergency plans for facilities. Everyone was very accommodating and supportive.
