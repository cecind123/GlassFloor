bad,"They say they’ll train you and that you’re always free to ask questions, but that could not be further from the truth. Management is nothing but terrible here. The work is monotonous, with far below average industry pay. Multiple insurance lines have been operating at an annual multi-million dollar loss for several years, and management pushes/blames that on its employees. The main system used in processing is literally decades old. It is extremely antiquated, finicky and will crash unpredictably. The company as a whole has been struggling to bring itself into the 21st century and that in part plays to the money being lost every day. Overall, my coworkers are enjoyable to be around, but management is insufferable. Would not recommend working her unless it is a last option."
bad,Poor management. Poor leadership.  No one cares about the employee or the customer.  Very sad. There really isn't anything else to say. Talk to the customer.
bad,Management is terrible. Too many people that want to be the boss. Everyone acts like they are better than the next. Would not recommend working here at here at all. Training is not properly given to support your job. Upper management bad mouth other employees. Just a really bad environment to work in.
bad,"The company is for the employees, which is good and bad. Its good to the employees meaning, it allows the same destructive behaviors to continue however allowing chance after chance to make correction with there being no recourse. Its bad because it pushed good quality employees out the door. Management is for themselves, and asking the ""WHY"" questions, you immediately have a target put on your back. The stress of the unknown takes a toll on your overall health. If you are an employee who cares, this is not the place to work at. If you are an employee who wants a check, get away with doing just enough work and have no ambition to move up or grow, this is the perfect place for you, and you can join the 3,000 plus employees who are currently content right where they are."
bad,You expect your managers to have constructive criticism.  The person I had to deal with was more a bully than anything else.  I loved my job and I still love working with insurance but not with this company.
bad,"No good Management, had little to no training when I got promoted to sales manager. District Manager did not give any information about the contract when promotion was given."
bad,"Much the same how American National Insurance Company got their start in bed with the mob, is the gangster sales mentality ingrained in its corporate culture today. Definitely a company that stays true to its legacy."
bad,"Management is unethical.  If you disagree with the lack of ethics, management makes the working environment difficult for you until you leave or are fired for insubordination.  Human Resources does not seem to care about the lack of ethics or the employees that are subjected to it. The company preaches ""Do What is Right"" however, when ethical issues are brought to the company's attention, the managers somehow always find out who made the report and what was actually said.  Benefits are available, but the health insurance is almost unattainable.  Good ole boy network, its not what you know, its who you know."
bad,"Stay away from this company unless you like working for a company that treats people unfairly, Discriminates against employees with disabilities. Management is poor at best and most new hires do not stay more then six months. CTS is the worst, again stay away if you are looking for a nice flexible job in IT. They expect you to work after hours and provide no comp time to make up for your hard work."
bad,"They said that the CEO was making all of these positive changes due to poor feedback from an employee survey in 2014. Its now 2018 and they are telling us that we need to come up with the solutions to the problems. Not a lot had changed in the culture. They promise promotions, raises, bonuses, etc. Never follow through. Even years later, ""oh we never said that we would do those things"".  High stress and high turn over. HR is not on the same page as the rest of the company either."
bad,"Too many things to say about upper management did and knew going wrong but seem to blind when the big trips wrte going on.  Upper management realize agents were failing and they didn’t take action to help, until agent was already dead"
bad,"Turn back and RUN. This place is falling apart and quickly. There’s resentment between the Springfield and League City offices and the training is a joke. No one is trained the same so everyone is doing the work incorrectly. They replaced a great manager with an inadequate “supervisor” who is just a court jester for the management in Springfield to order around. There is zero accountability. If one manager from a completely different department doesn’t like you, they make a point to make your job more difficult. You can be doing an amazing job but if one person in management doesn’t like you, you will not succeed there. As it happens, there is rarely room for success or opportunities to move up in your career. They do not respect you as a human being. Do yourself a favor and find a job elsewhere. They are NOT worth it."
bad,Upper management cares more about the employees in TX than anything. Springfield home office is just an after thought and it is apparent. Middle management states we cannot hire more employees while other departments are hiring like crazy. Underwriting is overwhelmed and overworked. The agents are allowed to speak to you like you are actual garbage but you are not allowed to defend yourself because their reviews determine your raise. Poor communication from managers to employees resulting in many mistakes and unnecessary stress. Cry at least once a week at my desk. Turn over is extremely high in underwriting because few people are able to manage the immense stress.
bad,"Company permits unethical treatment by management to team members, resulting in hostile work environment."
bad,The manager was not helpful in helping you learn the products. He was more interested in letting us know how much he knows and how successful he was selling insurance.
bad,"Terrible Management. Lower level management is under immense pressure and take that pressure out on their staff. Also, the lower level manager have little to no experience under the new operating systems and often struggle to understand the complications of newer systems. This is blanket statement and isn't true for all the managers, but as a general rule, it was more common than not. On the claims floor turn over was incredibly high due to under staffing and high demands combined with lower than average pay for the industry."
bad,"First and foremost, ANPAC does not pay fair market rates.  You can, however, get in the door there and get good experience to take with you somewhere else.  I held several positions during my time there and each one was underpaid for the level of work that was expected.   "
bad,"If you're not 'liked' by mgmt - you're out of luck.  Doesn't matter if you're more than qualified or not.  You'll see people come and go like a revolving door - no joke.  Awful, just absolutely ridiculous place to work."
bad,The company had a great atmosphere but having the agents as solely commission based did not fit for me very well so I did not enjoy my time with the company.
bad,"This company is still in the 90s for their business equipment.  I have never worked such an old system.  They do not provide an atmosphere that makes you feel comfortable in having questions.  They make fun of their clients and their questions, so it makes you feel as if they think your stupid if you ask a question.  The training program is so scattered and yet they have high expectations of errors, yet no one knows what their doing because they change things everyday.  So stressful, makes you want to go insane."
bad,"I love the work I do, but management is horrible. Some of the people are nice and have made great friendships, but others are not."
bad,This was a call center job. If you messed up it can be fixed but you will NEVER hear the end of it. Customers called often to cancel because they have some of the highest rates in the nation.
bad,"Very Stressful. Must work hard everyday.  Must work hard everyday. long long hours long long hours,very weak support. everyone for themselves. Management support is a joke"
bad,"American National Insurance Company is a company where nepotism is alive and well. Many of the managers are friends or related, and management typically promotes within, from other management related positions. The benefits are terrible and very costly for hourly employees while upper management receives free benefits for their entire family. The pay is not competitive either with raises usually consisting of .20 to .30 cents."
bad,This organization would have been much better to work for if the management and agent were more committed.
bad,Management does not know what goes on half the time. Company is far behind other company's when it comes to technology. Management tells you what to do and they don't want to hear your suggestions. Benefits are not that good and insurance is expensive. Company has been losing business over the years as well.
bad,"American National Insurance is not one of the most advanced companies in the industry. If you’re coming from larger corporations be prepared to feel set back with processes and systems that are outdated. Favoritism outweighs everything concerning promotions and advancement. Several managers feel entitled to be involved in your personal life and if you choose not to share they take it personal and make work life harder on you. They give the perception they care about you as a whole but it’s really a tactic to gather personal information to use against you. I’ve never worked somewhere and seen so many people cry at their desks on a daily basis, not because of the work but because of managements bullying and the constant need to micromanage every detail of your work existence. The only positive I took away from this job was enjoying my coworkers. I will say some departments are much better than others. Would steer away from the call center!!"
bad,"The company is a small company that has it's own insurance products that includes health and life. The only problem is the health plans are very outdated, and management is a small community that tends to have a high micro-management operation. It can be difficult to communicate to the some of these officials and certain things have to be done the way they are use to. Things could have changed since I've worked there, but others say the conditions have just became much more unbearable."
bad,"This is an old company ran by old people. They are tough to nudge into new SAFER directions. Just expect to be behind in standards. The common phrase is ""we always done it this way"". People who come here typically love the security which is awesome. Everyone here worked here for over 20 years. This company loves to keep their employees."
bad,Morning meetings and exams. Turned in paperwork and money and created a route for the day. drove to each client on the route to get their debit and tried to sell policies.
bad,This position requires a lot of patience and flexibility with a flexible personal lifestyle. you must be willing to work extra hours during the week and weekends. Also must be okay with commission based pay.
bad,"Poor management!"
bad,"This company requires you to dig up your own leads with -0- marketing help save for brochures.  Better to go with well known companies if you are new to the business like Farmers, Allstate, State Farm or Farm Bureau.  While some agents have done well with Anpac, it is an uphill battle and grind. They don't provide advertising or brand name recognition, you have ONE company to rate and compete for the customers business, they have no paid health insurance, -0- retirement benefits, commissions are average to below average and when you leave they own the customers and you get NOTHING for your blood sweat and tears other than a 2 year Non-compete clause.  I don't regret being an agent with them, only so long before I left them.  When your rates go up and they will, you have no place to rewrite your client- Result - many will leave you --"
bad,"Be prepared to take on additional responsibilities without recognition or pay.  You are not compensated for what you know or the work you complete once hired. The company gives horrible annual raises that do not take cost of living into account and benefits aren't great.  Company no longer offers a pension and recently reduced 401k contributions.  Employees are not valued as senior management thrives on profits.  If you're looking for incentives such as bonus, then you will be disappointed. New employees make significantly more than long term employees and do not have the skills to perform their job functions.  In some instances, new employees lack the desire to learn. Tenured employees are forced to supervise new employees that are hired for a lesser role, yet the new employees make more than the supervisor in many instances. Most employees are looking for a paycheck and put minimal effort in as they are simply there to get a paycheck.  Many department heads do whatever they please with no regard to ethical standards that the company promotes. The company covers up ethical claims when reported as well.  Some managers micromanage employees and punish those who have legitimate illnesses and use PTO days, while others call in sick a couple of times per week due to hangover or lack of desire to surround themselves with negative culture. Be prepared for high school drama and gossip within your department as every department has this issue.  When management gets bored, often times they target innocent employees to entertain themselves.  Complete abuse of power is found throughout"
bad,"Definitely not the kind of place that promotes based on performance.  If you've been there long enough and kissed the right butt, you will promote just fine.  If you work hard and go beyond expectations but do not suck up to the right people, you will be stuck.  The company management lacks integrity and purposely misleads employees regarding its financial status to pressure employees into working harder for longer periods of time to avoid properly staffing the claims department.  Pay & benefits are on the bottom end of the curve competition curve."
bad,American National was a very challenging place to work. It is a closely held family business. The work from day to day was very interesting.  Management is changing the culture to become more collaborative instead of being told this is the way it has always been done. The 401K match has been discontinued which has caused unhappiness amongst the employees.  
bad,"District manager got promoted and office manager became district manager. District manager did not want to promote this man."
bad,"Treats all their employees like slaves. They do not care if you quit, because they know someone will take your job. They have constant turnover because of their pay structure and moral."
bad,Support from the Ivory Tower in Texas is selective. Tough to work without necessary quality staff and under the increasing pressure to do much more with much less.
bad,I absolutely loved the work that I did at American National Insurance Company. I learned a lot while working there and was able to use some of that knowledge at other jobs thereafter. The department I worked in was very competitive and production driven. The methods that were used to drive production were destructive to coworker harmony.
bad,"Pre-made clients to do collections on everyday .Easy to find leads through referrals and word on mouth from existing clients. "
bad,"37.5 hour weeks were nice, but IT was cut twice so I left before the third chop."
bad,"it's high stress due to co workers."
bad,"I loved what I did, but the Greed of the Moody's cutting commissions in half if you did not have tri-line business in the home was the straw that broke the camels back with myself and most of the other agents in the Amarillo area. Most of us left at that point. We gave them everything we had and all they did was TAKE!"
bad,The company is heavily influenced by the Galveston home office. This is to the point of stifling ideas at other locations. There is a strong sense of favoritism in upper management.
bad,"The job is great through training, and your first while out on the floor. Not very much PTO offered compared to similar  companies, tons of micro-management. Low level management is decent at best, and I’m surprised that upper management hasn’t destroyed the company from the inside out."
bad,"great employees, original head supervisor was awesome and then management changed and the new head supervisor watched numbers too much, supervisor in the office was great, training wasn't consistent at all, lack of communication was outrageous."
bad,"a slow paced old school insurance company.  Not much room for career growth/ advancement in the office administration department. Good job for college student or someone wanting to get into the life insurance business. Management is the good ole boy attitude.  The manager's idea of buying employee lunch was Little Caesar's pizza (yuck).  Tried to get office admin to do the sales peoples jobs for no compensation other than what they paid per hour.  Constantly having to correct the sales peoples work so that insurance policies would be written.  The office admin manager was great, other than that not a promising place to work."
bad,"Company not into investing in their sales teams.  Too interested in dangling carrots over heads in an effort to over work sales staff to produce.  Too much corporate funds wasted on frivolous company trips, and not invested into marketing supplies for sales teams or increase of employee benefits.  Inflating product premiums, with annual decrease of sales commission percentages.  Decrease of employee benefits with significant increases in employee premiums.  Liquidation of employee retirement fund."
bad,"Worked in a small office in League City, TX.  Main office was in Springfield, MO.  Main office seemed to do a lot of different activities for their employees.  The small office I was in tried to a few things now and again, but it did not have the same feel as the main HQ.  The main office would get jealous if our small office did something they did not get to do and then we would hear about it and it would be taken away from us while most of the things they did at the home office, we could not participate in at all.  Very unfair.  Pay was horrible for the area, benefits were almost non-existent.  No 401k match, health insurance was very expensive which required me to buy my own outside of the company.  Left after several years with no 401k to take to my next job.  Work was stressful and never ending, could never catch up."
bad,"In general, ANICO is a decent workplace.  However, pay and career paths have been a stumbling block for me.  If I didn't care about pay I'd be more inclined to stay."
bad,Pays Well. Good set schedule working normal business hours. Only real complaint is lack of support from management. Never were there to answer questions.
bad,"Extremely secure employment environment. Most of the staff have been there for decades. This however creates an imbalance in both employee outlook and non-pay benefits. There's a caste system between long-term and short term employees."
bad,"The atmosphere overall is fair. I have a cubicle that I can decorate and I happen to be lucky with a window by my cubicle with a nice view. I struggle with pay options here, because the pay in my department is very low and there is almost no room for advancement. Growth is very difficult. We are not allowed more than 37.5 hours per week and we are still needed to get in more than 40 hours worth of work. I wish they allowed more overtime. We also struggle to get raises and they just cut the amount their were going to contribute to our 401(k)'s. We also have no sick days."
bad,"Being one of the oldest and conservative industries, the company is extremely slow and resistant to change.  When I left, the company was having an identity crisis and trying to push the same old, tired, internal PR initiatives to try and convince everyone that we were all one company when there was clearly animosity between the Texas and Springfield primary offices.  The transitions taking place could have been handled significantly better than they were."
bad,"American National can be a great place to work, but there is little room for advancement and the pay scale is low."
bad,"It is not a company you would want to sacrifice your"
bad,"Laid back atmosphere. Not enough challenges present personally for myself, but others may find the company culture to their liking."
bad,The employees at American National are friendly and helpful. Probably a good place to learn the ropes of the administration side of the insurance industry.
bad,"Employers treat employees poorly."
bad,Selling life insurance door to door was not the easiest thing to do. It worked in the time frame that I had to deal with at that time in life.
bad,Lively place to work. Management can be very helpful and The hardest part of the job is cold calling
good,"Easy daily duties, not stressful.  First week of the month is when we are the busiest.  Can be boring at times. Inner office is usually on our own daily.  The Agents only come in to turn in their collections twice a week."
good,Management needs empathy training. Team building is needed to bring  cohesive team environment back to the company. Cross training employees should be revisited to make a better workplace for all employees.
good,freedom to sale as many policies as you can and earn as much money as you are able to.you got to interact with different  people .but the hardest part of the job is the leads they provide are not good quality leads and you can hardly sale any body on the  list of leads they provide . I had to leave because  i lost my older brother .overall i enjoyed working with the manager who  was a very helpful  person.the only problem is there is no benefits offered to the employees.
good,I review life insurance policies for accuracy. I handle phone calls and emails from the agents.  This requires immediate response.  I also confirm new policies and existing policies have the correct plans and requirements needed to place the policy in force.  I also monitor the draft dates and ensure all banking information is correct prior to issue.
good,"Lacking promotion, the management only hire family members and put them into positions they are not qualified for.  Employee who have been with the company for over 10 years does not get the respect they deserve from those in authority."
good,"the management seleccoon as the sales managers"
good,The company does not have any consideration for their employees.  You are expected to work ten hours and more a day just to barely keep up.  It isn't appreciated either.  If you work remotely you will not be considered for any other job as they only go to those that work in the corporate office.
good,"To take in money from agents and enter all information into the computer. process beneficary changes, ownership changes, death claims. file. Purge files on a montly basis."
good,Flexible work hours company doesn’t really care for employees or clients  the office personnel aren’t friendly towards other employees higher up managers are happy as long as employees make sales numbers
good,I worked remotely from home. The underwriting department was short on life underwriting consultants to meet work demands so most days were very long and exhausting at times.
good,"Employees need training on work ethic.  "
good,"The workload in my department was very mismanaged. I feel due to the ratio of supervisors to employees. While I did work on a lot of different tasks at once, it did help me gain a lot of knowledge in the insurance world."
good,"Writing insurance policies, collecting premiums and selling insurance products"
good,I think the company is a great company but management needs ALLOT of work. Coming from a structured environment like the Atlantis I didn't feel as if management did an very good job at operations or management for that matter
good,"Working here is fun, the staff is amazing.  There is so much competition between all of the insurance companies, that it can be very stressful.  Rate hikes and back office problems do nor make it any easier."
good,Everything is great as far as working with clients. The drive to sulphur springs and commerce makes for a tiresome day. Altogether If you could work in your home town it would be better.
good,"American National definitely has potential but they have been around for over 100 years and nothing seems to be getting any better. The upper management doesn't connect with lower management enough to know what is really going on. The employees mostly dislike the company but stay there for job security and convenience. There is a big time ""good ole boy"" network that promotes friends and relatives over hard workers without relations there. The benefits are very nice which almost make up for the generally low salaries. There is a unanimous feeling of ""afraid of change"" which results in very inefficient systems and poor customer service. Disorganized is the best way to describe everything."
good,American National Insurance offers many great products for citizens of all ages.  The company also partners with progressive to ensure anyone looking for insurance will be covered.
good,"A typical day at work is good because of the people that you work with. I learned lots in regards to life insurance. You will have to learn all by yourself. Management really doesn't know the products that we sell or the actual systems that we use. Management lacks in this company. The co-workers are great. You have your lazy ones and you have the ones that work hard. Just like in any other job. The hardest part of the job is when the company puts out new life insurance products and they do not make you aware of them. All of a sudden you get an application for the new product and you don't know what to do. This is why management lacks. In regards to advancement you will have to be a managers pet or be related to someone that has some sort of pull in the company. There are so many employees that are related it's crazy. The people that you work with is the best part of the job. If you like to be confined in a cubicle and have managers that don't really know the business, and only get .10 cent raises every year, this is the place for you. Oh, and for it to be an insurance company the health insurance for their employees in expensive and doesn't cover much."
good,"Review of various personal and commercial automobile claims.  Settling of both property damage and bodily injury claims."
good,The company doesn’t have enough time to train a new employee like they should because there is a very high turnover rate. The company doesn’t include or rather let the new hires know exactly how they are going to get paid once training is over.
good,"Training started with a very bitter trainer that was actively looking for work elsewhere. Out of training there were lots of high-school like drama events."
good,"I went into this job without a lick of knowledge of how health insurance truly worked. All I knew was I needed it in order to be seen by a doctor and everything was covered because I have health insurance...so I thought. After 8 weeks of training and much knowledge shoved into my brain I wondered what the heck I got myself into. Well I stuck with and now I love it! Not only do I help customers understand their insurance coverage and how it works but I also have the privilege of helping my family with their insurance needs. With my knowledge I have been able to save people hundreds and thousands of dollars by not making overpayments to providers and waiting on refunds that can sometimes take over 2 years to get back. So if you're looking for a job in the health insurance industry American National is a great place to start and expand your knowledge. American National also offers a wide variety of insurance besides health; they offer life, auto, home, classical vehicles, and so much more."
good,"The first six months were great, I learned a lot and i always give them credit for that but they have some of the lowest commission rates in the industry."
good,Report in every Tuesday and Friday to turn in.  Responsible for calling clients and making appointments to meet with them.  You should be a very self driven person because the work you get paid for is the work that you produce.  If you do not sell life insurance you will not make money!
good,"The company is ok to work for, no medical benefits. The best part of the job is working with clients one on one and helping them understand why doing business with me is such a value to them."
good,"I Love my coworkers, my supervisors are so sweet.. above them their management not so great. Really wish we could be offered more pto. One day off every week would’ve been nice too."
good,They need better training for agents and make them have the license before making sales. Make sure to have a reliable car and willing to work long hours in order to collect premium from clients.
good,This was always a great place to work until new management came along. They really need to be more upfront when certain decisions affect a persons job
good,Disrupting colleagues who were allowed to complain all day so management was weak and showed lack of leadership.  Human resources did not respond to complaints of disruptive employees.  Managers of other departments were deliberately oblivious of bad behaviour.
good,"Handled clients life insurance, accident and health insurance. Scheduled appointments to meet with clients and prospect clients. Home service clients to collect insurance premium payments. Created proposals for prospect clients. Composed and mailed out collection letters to delinquent accounts. Submitted completed applications to underwriters."
good,This job is all about networking and selling a product that most everyone already has. The market saturation and the low level name brand means sales are relationship based or emotional in terms of life insurance.
good,American National is a good company when it comes to getting the basic skills and knowledge of the insurance industry. Most days are spent at the computer. The downside is it's not easy to learn new skills unless you move to a different department.
good,"Driving door to door,time consuminng and stressful. How to stay movited and determined.Management was not supportive and unaviability.The hardest part is the turn dow by the customer you approated."
good,"If you like to sale then this is a great job for you! Very competitive position. Sale Manager is a very good mentor. I like the hours, mostly bed working in the afternoon until dark."
good,"Productive while you are there. Not a lot of people enjoyed it but i did."
good,I was an independent contractor with no benefits. Commission changed month to month. Constantly worried about money and taxes. Unstable income and worries about money and taxes.
good,"My job would consist of not only selling life insurance but actually going to their home to collect the premium. "
good,"For me entering a company not knowing anything about insurance sales, I really learned a lot and had a great experiences with clients, team members, administration."
good,"I really enjoyed my position and my relationship with my manager. However, there were many aspects of the company that made me wonder about their overall direction."
good,typical day is driving to clients houses and picking up premiums. 2 days out he week you are expected to report to the office and turn in your cash collection for the week.
good,I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked at American National but I believe I have plateaued in this company and am ready to move on to bigger and better things. The job culture is a little old school and there is not a whole lot of room for advancement. Health insurance wasn't the best either. Overall otherwise it is an okay company to work for.
good,"Provide administrative support with a high level of customer service and a supportive management team.  Challenged to find out answers to an abundant amount of questions from employees. "
good,I have learned to help customer as much as possible. To be able to have a first call resolution and to make sure the customers are happy when they hang up the phone.
good,"The best part of this job was meeting with my clients and with new clients, The hardest part was collections especially when the client didn't have the funds and they were struggling to make their payments. The worst part of this job was having to ride with a manager in your car on a weekly basis that not only curses at you but also slams your doors and throws things around in your car, including empty food bags after she ate!"
good,"This company is very good about giving employees a good place to start, and gain experience in their field. Once trained a lot is expected of the employees as far a workload goes."
good,"Out in the field daily. Good people in the office. Have to be patient and willing to work in the field to be a collector. Sales are not hard to find, but time in the field is heavy."
good,"Management is disconnected from field sales associates"
good,Adequate opportunity to make good income. Tough to compete with other carriers.
good,"My days were very productive working on the field, I learned to manage my time and stay productive."
good,A good company to work for management was understanding and worked with employees on personal circumstances. A typical day at work was when the claims checks were not printed on a timely manner but management jumped in and helped when needed. A small department of 6 people so for the most part everybody got along and the best part of the job I got to interact with other departments.
good,"Provided Home Services, Collected Cash Premiums, Submitted and Received Transfers, Received and Posted Mail Payments, Deposited Daily Collections, Recorded Client Premium Book, Updated Client Records, Delivered Insurance Policies"
good,•Worked as an insurance agent assisting customers with the insurance policies.
good,"ANICO is a very stable insurance company.  For most positions, there is a good work/life balance.  The medical benefits are below industry standard and 401k match is 4%."
good,It was an decent place to work but American National had many rate increases that made it difficult to find and keep clients. There were some positives to the business. Their cashback program and life insurance policies are hard to beat.
good,The work place was a good environment to work in we received  great training on our product we were selling week to week. Each quarter if we met our quota we had different game we played to win bonus prizes.
good,"Great Flexibility, they pay you a set amount the 1st 3 months and based on your sales you can make more. If you don't sell you pay will reduce. Great job to have if you have a second income."
good,"I have to agree with another post on here;"
good,"Staff has the ability to be great with the right motivation, unfortunately reviews vary little for those that do the minimum to those that work hard. Management, starting with upper management, needs to be work on their communication with staff. ANICO has a lot of senior management that has been around for years so very little changes. Sales goals are not communicated to the staff so that we can push to achieve them."
good,"This job allows for some flexibility of the working schedule.  Some days are busier than others because best to collect monthly premiums on pay days.  Employee must use own vehicle for door to door collections of premiums and sales in an allotted area.  Due to cost of gas and car maintenance, it may or may not be profitable."
good,"This is a great job if you are ready to ride out till retirement. You won't be working on the latest and greatest. You won't be making a lot of money. It is a steady job with steady reliable requirements, deadlines, and some small challenges."
good,managaement in lower positions has been there for years and years. Hard to move up in any position unless you are adjuster. It is only a 37/5 hour week
good,Great work/home balance.  Work week is 37.5 hours with full benefits.  They have a wide range of jobs and I worked in software development.  They didn't have much of a training program and little organized documentation to help a new hire understand their systems and processes.  The environment was pleasant and facilities nice including great break rooms and even a deli on-site.
good,A typical day can vary depending on the position you hold.  The IT jobs are pretty typical except they don't document the locally developed products very well if at all.
good,"I have filled many roles in one position from Refund Clerk to Business Process Analyst. "
good,not a lot of help from upper management all they care is for themselves so you better sell while they seat at the office all day and go eat while you drive about 200 to 300 miles daily to pick up payments
good,As an insurance agent with American national insurance company I was able through management and supervision to learn on a daily basis the business of insurance. Obtain the ability to assess and assist individuals and companies and provide necessary assistance for their needs.
good,I worked with my family helping out when my dad had a stroke. I could work my own hours.
good,They have a great manager team and the district manager is also great. They will pay you while you take a 2 week class to get your L&H license. Theres alot of running around so be prepared to use a lot of gas. And i wish they would do more ride outs with people who need it instead of the top producers. I didnt feel like i got much training on the selling aspect.
good,Cool place to work at if you don't mind using your own vehicle. The compensation is great and you can make a lot of money if you are willing to work hard. l
good,American National allowed one to learn the business of life and health insurance sales and service. The management worked with you daily to hone your skills and perspective that lead to success as a professional agent.
good,I enjoyed and loved the people I worked with. I came into this business with very little experience. I wish I had been given more training on the specifics of this business rather than merely thrown out into the field.
good,productive and need to make daily insurance sales. it's alot of driving from difference cities.  Meet different walks of people in the insurance industry.  The more in sales can win trips to different places
good,"The worst mistake I ever made. I was brought in as a Senior Programmer Analyst and was given a good salary and 3 weeks vacation to start. Then I found out why. They do not want someone who has ideas or opinions to help improve anything. Just shut up, keep your head down and code. They have five test environments and you need to provide a seperate proc for each test environment. Symbolics??? ""NO, that's just the way we do things here"" was the standard answer to any suggestions you will provide. After two months it made me physically ill to have to get up and go to work. The hurricane turned out to be a blessing for me and allowed me a way out."
good,Great company from an insurance standpoint but terrible company from an employee perspective. Constant changes in compensation payouts and then completely going away with certain products that made up of in some instances 40-50% of that agents annual income.
good,There is eagerness to climb to the top and climb fast.  Not a lot of compassion and personable report between upper management and employees.  Lots of politics and old school corporate politics.  Not a fan of the upper management.
good,"You have a very set schedule with good pay. Only open five hours a week during standard business hours. My only  complaint would be lack of any formal training, and  very little support."
good,"A typical work day includes checking the computer to find out which information is missing and who I need to follow-up with.  Contacting clients for forms or missing information.  Contacting potential clients, prospecting and marketing.  Meet at clients or prospects home in the evening to gather information or present insurance proposal.  I learned a lot about finding clients problems or needs and figuring out a way to resolve problems or fill the need.  I really enjoy working with the management,  They are always so eager to help me and to do joint appointments.  I hired several secretaries and enjoyed working with them.  I also associate with a lot of good agents within the company on a regular basis.  I have become acquainted with a lot of good agents who work for American National throughout the U.S.  The hardest parts of the job are;maintaining all client information, keeping up on all property and casualty documentation etc., time management, and underwriters.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting with prospects and clients.  I enjoy walking away from a home knowing that a client is satisfied with their home, auto, or life insurance policy.  I find a lot of satisfaction knowing that a client has coverage or feels a sense of security in a life insurance policy.  I really enjoy meeting new people, spending time with other agents, and helping clients."
good,When I worked at ANPAC it was an enjoyable place to work. Many changes have occured so i do not know what it is like now. Many training courses are available and encouraged.
good,"Enjoyed working here, cultivates a family atmosphere and not unusual for people to spend their entire careers there. The biggest downside is advancement opportunities."
good,"Really a great place to work overall; very established company, healthy PTO and it has all the requirements of a standard job w/ 401k and such.  This being said, the company is very big and therefore pretty competitive when it comes to promotions and advancement.  A lot of people there have been there for 20+ years and will not be leaving their jobs anytime soon.  This being said, when a position does open up, there are 25 internal applicants and it is difficult to advance."
good,"Selling insurance was a daily task. You learn to identify the needs of others. Management was ok. The hardest part was production. The workplace culture was team spirited. The most enjoyable part was working outside,"
good,"It wasn't a good fit for me, however it worked out great for some of my fellow agents.  We are in a start-up area for American National so that was challenging, and my manager lived 4 1/2 hours away, so that what challenging too.  For the right person, however, this can be a great opportuinty."
good,This is a great job for someone who can sell.This is a commission based job with set sells to be met.
good,Very good place to work for. I love the enviorment. Working as a secretary is so fun.
good,"This was my first job in a call center environment and in Life Insurance where as I was only knowledgeable in Annuities.  I increased my understanding and knowledge in customer service and enjoyed learning more aspects of insurance.  I enjoyed helping the customers with their questions and concerns on their life insurance policies.  The management was attentive as once I was comfortable I immediately asked how I could move up in the company.  I was awarded Customer Service Representative before my year review and positioned as Team Coach.  I loved my job in assisting other co workers in understanding our products and clients questions.  "
good,Received my certification for life insurance. Worked 40 plus hours a week. Left the company due to my assigned route and the location was in a hard part of town.
good,Constantly seeing clients collecting monies and making changes to policies. Everyday having contact with clients and getting new leads from clients or potential clients.
good,"With 17 years of work experience in the Individual Health Claims Division at American National, I would have to say that it was one of the greatest experiences in my life. I learned so much about how to run on office, how to effectively communicate with people, both verbally and in writing."
good,"A typical day at work begins with checking voicemail and emails. From there you simply step into the Claims Adjuster role. 85-90% of the day is spent on the phone. I was blessed to be placed under an outstanding manager, in a great unit. I can't say that every other adjuster is as lucky as I have been. The most difficult part of the job is realizing that not everyone understands insurance, it's a language that is often blurry, even to seasoned professionals. As a guy who prefers face-to-face interaction and the feeling of a job well done, this role presents its share of difficulties. As a whole, this is a company with many different departments to try your hand at. As a recent college graduate, ANPAC has been great to me. As a young professional, ANPAC has provided me with knowledge of what I excel in, where I need to be in my career, and experience to move into a position more tailored for my needs."
good,"American National was a great place to have freedom to work independently. However, it was stressful to meet sales goals and collection goals. When goal were met compensation was great."
good,"agents might have and easier time validating and staying solvent if leadership was more aware of specific winning lead generation/prospecting methods in their given regions, and it would also help if they stayed on board."
good,"It was a fun place to work, the people are great and work interesting but the management is terrible. Communication is non-existent. The work is very innovative and leading edge, the management is stuck in the 70's"
good,"A typical day at work entails me out prospecting for several hours, customer service work, and new client meetings. The hardest part of my job is not having control of rates, etc. The easiest part of my day is meeting new people."
good,Good pay and benefits but no opportunity for advancement unless you were one of the clique. Conservative politics in a largely white office. Great work/life balance.
good,"I worked in the customer service department of the home office in Springfield, MO. I loved working there. Management was always trying to improve upon various things to make our job easier or a little less stressful."
good,"Just like any other large Company their is ups and downs. work atmosphere is good, and company is family friendly to a employees needs. They are a bit behind in the times when it comes to technology, and processing if insurance claims but are on their way to moving forward with the industry. Great work hours. Management on the Claims floor needs an overhaul or retraining as the current employees seem to be more advanced or knowledgeable than the old school Management team that continues to hold back progress. the pay is low compared to the rest of industry, but comparable to the large scale business in the area. good opportunity for someone wanting to learn the Insurance in & outs to move on in the future to a larger based Insurance company for more money."
good,"Overall, American National is a decent place to work. 15 days of PTO is offered once hired (5 of which you can roll over to following PTO calendar year). Another benefit to American National is there are multiple departments. When you get burnt out on one job, you can apply for another department without having to change employers entirely. One major flaw to American National: they're VERY top heavy. There are 4 VP's for the Actuarial department alone. The biggest downfall to the company is the compensation. Since there isn't another major insurance headquarter company in Springfield, they've been able to pay their employees on average $10k less than the same jobs in a larger city."
good,"A great company with immense financial security. The daily function begins with preparation of the number of clients to assigned on your log sheet that either are in arrears of monthly insurance premium and need to be contacted to avoid a late payment; lapse and cancellation of insurance. Reminder phone calls, lapse letters and going in person to determine if there are any problems facing the client to determine a number of options available to the agent. Payment arrangements can be made; premium loans and be negotiated and alternative dates can be set-up to assist client in meeting their premiums payment to avoid a cancellation of their insurance policy. Meetings are usually a part of the daily operations."
good,"Typical day at work as a console operator is watch all the monitoring system to see failures. I have had a lot of OJT for mainframe, as400, production control."
good,The managers are always willing to help and offer advice. Every person is friendly. The hardest part is working and studying for the certification exam that every agent needs to sale life insurance.
good,"I would come in and start the coffee, arrange the dishes and was what haven't been done. I would log into my computer and update what needed to be updated. The phones wouldn't ring a lot but we had to make a lot of calls. We wrote a lot of emails. Sometimes we couldn't get in contact with our clients so we would try to get to them through our work messenger or work text."
good,"I am responsible for ensuring that policies are issued as quickly as possible, print out and/or respond to all emails for the district office, supervise on staff, interact with agents as necessary, make copies, create forms, retention for audits, pass audits, create new reports, creating a system by which the office can function efficiently, maintain/order supplies, provide customer service to policyholders, take premium payments from policyholders, etc.."
good,"Because I was self employed every day is filled with prospecting clients, presenting to clients, writing business, servicing client accounts. That kept me busy because I can't yet afford to hire staff members to assist me."
good,"I enjoy working and talking with people, which made my job enjoyable. I will continue to work in insurance to give people a chance to better their life in the future."
good,"The use of an employee's vehicle without compensation is a con."
good,Manage accounts and customers.  A lot of driving and long hours required. There are a lot of ups and downs. Seasons and holidays weigh heavily on your success.  The pay is not consistent as it is based on several variables.  Not a good source of income for the head of household.  Perfect for a second income.
good,I would deal with the daily trading for outside 401(k) plans. I learned a lot about pension plans and the laws that affect them. I had some good coworkers who I still stay in touch with. I really liked the work. The biggest challenge was the deadline for trades. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to see what you accomplished when you were finished.
good,"Great Place to work. if you are an agent, and enjoy sitting behind a desk its the place for you"
good,"American National is a great company to work for, good products to sell clients."
good,I worked there as a auto claims adjuster and Bodily injury adjuster. It was a good place to work but is a large cube farm. Compared to other companies you are not paid as well.
good,I coded 100 applications or more per day. Very stressful. Breaks were limited. Your eyes needed a break from the computer. Hands cramping throughout the day. Relate to co workers on various work papers.
good,it is a career company.  Upper management seems nice. Middle management is as usual. If there was some kind of leads provided  this would really be a great company.  But it is still a very good company to work for. You will never miss a pay check
good,"Underwriting duties and customer service duties. Vacation time and benefits were good. The occasional manager would be disgruntled. Overall this was a great place to work, I was paid well, trained well, and the coworkers were like family."
good,"Benefits were not the best. A lot of nights & week-ends. Busiest on week-ends and Holidays. Being open on Sundays, have to work Family days."
good,ANPAC provides everything that an employee needs in order to be trained for a position as well as numerous opportunities for betterment as well as advancement.  The management truly cares about employees and it is evident in their behaviors and mannerisms daily.
good,"Recruit, Train and Supervise Sales and Service Force of 6 agents both in the office and in the field Highly Competitive atmosphere"
good,American National is a good insurance company.  There are unlimited opportunities for success.  The product was good.
good,Very nice staff! Receptionist is nice and helpful! Office management is very nice and sweet. Everything is organized and amazing. Small office but full of joy!
good,"Good company to work for, great people there, really stepping up their game on technology and keeping up with other companies. Things don't move to fast there , which is good."
good,"Location has a lot to do with everything. I work in the Springfield Office, and the so called ""Life of the Party"" probably needs to be on life support. It is almost non-existent. I am sure the home office is wonderful. If you were to make friends here I am sure it would make things a lot better, but honestly, it's pretty clique-ish."
good,"As an agent, I enjoyed working in my own sales territory.  I learned to be productive, patient ,and engaging to meet new prospects. Management meets with me once a week out in the field to help closed sales appointments."
good,"working in IT at ANICO can be rewarding if you work hard and maintain a friendly and outgoing attitude. Management tries its best to implement current best practice standards."
good,Service & selling Insurance account manager collect premium from customer homes & business  sales meeting very good company lot of good products to sell
good,"Coming in and training with the department I was intimidated about my knowledge coming in, but the people were so nice and helpful and really made me feel comfortable to ask questions and help myself learn and grow into an independent entity within the team."
good,"Great place to work! Managers are properly trained and are very organized. As an agent you will have a flexible schedule and weekends off. Also, unlimited earning potential."
good,"This was an awesome place to work, my colleagues were amazing, the customers were amazing. The training was adequate. The benefit package was great. The downside was the lay off."
good,American National was a great company to work for the tools they provide to get you started was healthful the management was instrumental to the success in the field
good,I worked as an independent insurance agent so I planned my own work schedule and workflow.  I enjoyed networking with a variety of other professionals.
good,"Answer phones help clients with there accounts other clerical duties "
good,"Every Friday everyone would show up at the office and turn in their money and give their report on how much insurance they sold. Meeting will last most of the morning with management. Every Friday was payday. Monday thru Thursday we will all be out in the fields to sale insurance or to pickup customer insurance money. My biggest area to cover was Bay City, Texas. I had a spot in Bay City where I will set for a few hours before I start my day to sale insurance or to pickup money. I had made a lot of calls and a calendar was my friend. The hardest part of the job was to past the test needed to continue to sell insurance. It was a fun job and I love to met be around people. Management was a great support system. My manager would take time out to support me if I was struggling."
good,Manage and running all day to operations from policy and client management to marketing for new business. Licensed in Ohio and Georgia.
good,"I was not there very long and I never got out of training before I decided to be a stay-at-home mom; but I enjoyed my time there.  The training was extensive but productive.  I learned quite a bit.  It is a huge company, so promotions or moving to another department are possible.  I remember the breakfast cart that came around; it was always the highlight of my day (probably because I was stuck in a training room all day and I was pregnant).  I would work for this company again."
good,"It was a nice place to work i  did the filing and answered phones. sometime i ran errands, nice hours.I Loved the 9 to 5 hours and one hour for lunch."
good,"The sales, service and collection process was a challenging set of diverse circumstances.  Never dull or the same from day to day. The  most challenging part of being in the insurance business is making quotas and collecting payments door to door.  I learned to never take diversity as a defeat but rather a challenge. Diversity is a way of problem solving and making things better.  Working independently allows for time management to be a way of life.  I was fortunate in that I worked toward and won a trip to Hawaii which gave me much confidence in my work ethic and performance."
good,"great job. really flex. fun people "
good,"typical day"
good,"American National Insurance Company was a fun place to work/ A typical day at work was meeting the faces of a diverse culture in all walks of life. There was so much to learn Attend meetings, seminars and programs to learn about new products and services, learn new skills, in  receiving technical assistance in developing new accounts. Co-workers were team orientated and very instrumental in making a days work worthwhile, The hardest part of sales in insurance was not making a sale for that day or not meeting expectation for the day. The most enjoyable part of my job was on Fridays turning in your debit and the great incentives corporate would have waiting, that was very exciting!"
good,Loved selling and helping people find insurance that they need.
good,Anico is a great company to work for. They offer a great training program that assist you with the knowledge of your job. 
good,I enjoyed my job here; I liked working with a diverse group of people; Learned a lot on this job in various areas of Life and Health Insurance. Great experience.
good,"I got to learn all about life insurance because of the great training, managers and supervisors were so helpful when needed, co-workers were a great team, dress code was proffessional, holidays and weekends off, i enjoyed my customers, and making them happy. Explaining their options."
good,"I feel that what is needed, is to revisit the customer's policies at least once a year and explain to them their coverage and how it works. Most people don't understand their policies or they think they have coverages that they don't"
good,"I worked on a team of professionals that was rewarding, progressive, and went above and beyond for our clients. I learned a lot during my time there and would work for them again in a heartbeat. The only reason why I resigned was because they were not open to remote work for my position. I loved my manager, but sometimes felt that the hierarchy of leadership was not always communicating effectively with each other. However, when faced with this difficulty, I was encouraged to voice my concerns and give feedback openly. I loved making new connections with business leaders and effecting change within the organization."
good,"Working at American National is like working with family, if you have any questions or concerns you can ask anyone around you and everyone is willing to help."
good,"American National Insurance is a nice place to work. Most customers are very friendly. Sales are sometimes hard to get, but if you are good at it, then it will work for you."
good,"Great flexible hours (you choose how much and when to work)"
good,"ANICO was a easy going work place with very experienced managers who actually knew what they were doing. Any question could be answered by them and they both knew the system and the product they were selling. One could learn a lot from that kind of leadership. The hardest part of the job was the upset customers, but it is the same in an customer service job."
good,"Theres one district manager($90k salary), Sales managers are paid $52k salary plus commissions and bonuses with full benefits, and agents with $700 a week for first 6 months and agents always have a paycheck every Friday whether you sold or not. Great job stability and place to learn the industry. You will always have a paycheck and a job here. If you don’t mind collecting monthly premiums then you will love this career."
good,"Good company. GREAT office. My direct supervisor and District Manager are top notch stand up guys. Really teach you how to do the job."
good,"Working for an independent insurance office was not a dependable job. I was let go when they couldn't afford to pay me any longer. The hours were few, under 20 per week."
good,"Good job. Very nice group of people. Family friendly, strong team driven office. Always ready to offer support for co-worker. Plenty of food days and office celebrations."
good,American national is a great place to work. They operate on a 37.5hr. work week which truly helps if you have family obligations. They do promote from within and have excellent training.
good,The job I held was only temporary work when I was younger and just getting started in the work environment. I filed documents into an organized fashion. Overall good work experience.
good,"I became an agency owner with American National this year (2016). After owning my own agency with a competitor years ago, I was somewhat skeptical. It is truly Day and Night. My business is thriving and the support I have received from the District office, Regional Office, and Home Office has been superior. They have one of the best contracts in the Multi-Line industry. Program is designed for you to make a lot of Money in the early years to get your business thriving. Mine is doing just that. I left the security of a nice salaried position. I am making double!! If you can sell, you will do great here. Great products and I love the culture!!"
good,"I enjoyed working there, the management was great they were very considerate of they're employees.  I worked there for 5 years until they closed their doors and relocated."
good,"Would complete leadsheets and tax returns depending on which department I was in. "
good,"Besides the old technology and gloomy looking walls and cubicles, I thought the company was great. I learned how to act in a professional manner. It is an older building/company, but with that comes a great history of success. Overall I would say its a good company to work for."
good,"a typical day was selling insurance and picking up payments from clients , data entry. The hardest part was trying to get ahold of some clients. I learned to deal with a variety of tasks all in one day. My coworkers were helpful and respectful."
good,"Helping people protect what they value most; Life, Home, Auto, Retirement plans/strategies."
good,Enjoyed owning my business. just a lot of headache keeping up with taxes and employees
good,"Insurable on time"
good,"Starting the day is nice, everyone says Good Morning, 2 days out of the week we can buy breakfast on sight. Great people to work with. "
good,"Employees are very helpful, learn a lot about the company, they give you tasks that will help you in the future, the internship program is developing great."
good,Great job to have. Needs to be more of team environment. Management needs to not be high minded. Hardest part of job is to not  do things that are not necessary.
good,"In the morning I go into my Boss/Agents office we sit and talk about clients and what needs to be done for the day. Each day is different due to some hours are spent on Marketing ideas and putting them together, as well as phone calls being made out to clients or underwriters. Also have files that need quoted for home and auto as well as life which I have not got into just yet. I learn something new every day and it is just adding on to my experience and knowledge of the business. I have learned the different language that comes from dealing with insurance company's and also having my bosses back when it comes to making sure to get things done and on time. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a file is fully done and others have been reviewed. That's enjoyable to me because that means more business to move onto. The hardest part of the job is not being able to make every client happy."
good,"Good company to work for. No car reimbursements. Agents are to drive alot of miles to do the job on a daily basis. With the new tax changes,  you can no longer write off mileage and car maintenance."
good,If you are into sells then this is a great job with great benefits. The hours are pretty flexible as long as you are producing the numbers needed and meeting the goals each week.
good,A typical day was working on the call center providing verification of benefits and claims processing. I learned how to quote benefits and tell whether a claim was processed correctly. If not I submitted it to be reprocessed with the explanation of what needed to be done to the claim. It was a fast paced and close working environment there were no cubicles. The hardest part of the job was being available for all the phones calls that came through on a daily basis. It was enjoyable to help others.
good,"With this job, I learned how to effectively communicate with customer's on a personal needs basis. Oppose to my previous customer service experience, this was definitely beneficial for me in life as well as a career."
good,"A typical day at American National was comprised of taking a high number of inbound calls on a wide range of life insurance products. These ranged from Universal to Whole Life policies where I fielded requests to change policy information and advise insured's about the amendment process. "
good,"A typical day with ANICO would include review Annuity Contracts for beneficiary information or contract discrepancies, created verification and rejections letters for policy change requests, and reviewing portfolios as a whole for each client."
good,"Loved this place, loved the job, learned a lot, enjoyed the home base sales agents- they will collect the premiums going from home to home and would turn in the money every Tuesday and Friday along with any sales applications to be turned in to underwriting- but before the applications were turned in, I had to make sure all the questions were answered, that the oral swabs, APS were ordered/attached if needed."
good,"In charge of the office. Bookkeeping all payroll reports. Sales,  I taught a class on selling. Started with 400 units, built to 3400.  I Loved my job."

good,This company cares about you as an individual. They allow you to be versatile and to grow as an individual.  The company respects you as an individual.
good,"Learned how to create tax forms through SuperForms and learned how to ship checks. Co-workers are very friendly and motivate me to work harder. Hardest part of the job was to use many excel files to work on the Illinois tax return. Best part of the job is the atmosphere, which is crucial. It has helped me deal with pressure moments."
good,"Great place to work, I have left and come back because I enjoyed it so much. It is a family environment with good benefits and pay. Worth working here."
good,"We do a lot of work here, but the environment of this job is very relaxed and enjoyable. The people here make you feel like family and are very helpful and kind."
good,"Great place!! I've learned a lot at American National Insurance Company, they teach you the basics and really build you up on it. Real Life Experience -- Good Old Fashion Sales!!"
good,I would not like to write a review. The job I have had a lot of challenges when I first started.  We have been thru several supervisors and the first 3 were excellent supervisors and you had a potential to improve and excel.  With the last supervisor you do not have that capability.
good,"American National is a good place to work, but like any captive insurance company the pay is based on performance. Cash flow is low at the beginning, and it can take a long time to accumulate sufficient renewal income to live comfortably."
good,"Energetic and exciting office, lots of communication and learning happens immediately after joining the team. Competitive wages and a inviting work environment make this a great place to work,"
good,Good company to work for. Work and personal life balances well. Team members are always helpful to new agents. I learned a lot from my MLGA. He was always there to help me when I needed it and when I had problems he always tried to help.

good,I learned great time management.  I was able to interact with several different people on a daily basis.  No two days were ever the same. Very flexible schedule.
good,Answer incoming calls help recruit new agents to work with american national.Assist with anything needed. Advertise for our company. Review files and make sure all information is in place.
good,American National is a great company to work for.  Combined Insurance requires to much road time to too little benefits.  Supplemental market in WV is tough due to low income and high unemployment.  Supplemental is first thing to get dropped when money is tight.
good,"Insurance Services with 16 Years Experence"
good,I enjoyed working at American National. Most of the people are friendly and the HR staff are exceptional. The only reason I am leaving after 13 years is because I am moving to a different state.
good,"This is a great place to work. Very friendly people, like a family. The atmosphere was great and I loved my job as well as my coworkers. I would recommend American National to anyone seeking employment."
good,"Wonderful work culture, almost monthly company lunches, easy access to upper management. Given the size of the company, things move slowly and cautiously, so patience is key."
good,"As a agent a typical day was to collect premiums form existing clents and make new applications for life insurance. We were self managed, reported to office twice a week with our collection of premiums  and sales for the week. Decipline the main thing that you learn. It was very important to your pay since it was commission only"
good,Great company to work for.  Good business ethics and regular opportunities for advancement.  Their HR department is excellent.
good,"Good company to work for, training is great, help you in any way they can, great support, great on the job training. "
good,"For what it's worth, I was just 1 of thousands of employees so tihs is obviously based on my experience in my department. I was fortunate enough to work for a wonderful Exec VP, as well as directly under another great VP. Compensation was fair with raises based on annual reviews. Co-workers were kind and easy to work with! Advancement opportunities are prevelant with the amount of positions available. All in all, a great place to work!"
