rating,review
bad,"Corporate and plant management can not get on the same page.  You have no life working for this company, and your just another number.  And you can not trust the management team."
bad,contract recruiter for the construction product division
bad,"Buddies get the farthest, but don’t get too close, and don’t give your opinion.  You never know which co-worker will cut you to get ahead, or how long you’ll dangle on the string of sadism that management uses to torture people just trying to support their families.  Oh, get ready to work any shift, and more overtime than you care to work because you’ll have little choice about your schedule."
bad,I  learned a lot while employed at HB Fuller. The company that I worked for was bought out  by Fuller. Many of my new  co-workers were intimidating/aggressive/harsh and this behavior was unchecked/ignored by management. This was the worst culture I have ever worked in. My direct supervisor was poorly qualified for her position.
bad,Left on your own to work untrained and then get warnings when you mess up.....managers are bullies and are intimidating and swear at you infront of other staff.......no help when you need it
bad,Always short staffed. Extremely hot  . No sense of teamwork. Holidays are not  guaranteed.  12 shifts. Point system. Fast paced. Physical. No respect.
bad,"Terrible management, terrible human resources department, terrible building,  no structure,  full of favoritism,  no accountability, this is by far the worst shop I have ever worked."
bad,Good work/life balance.  But few people are doing everyone's job.  The work culture had turned for the worst.  I don't see the company as a future innovator.
bad,Management is a joke. Supervisor likes to micromanage. very dirty environment. Company is very unorganized. I used to dred going to work everyday. Only thing good was available overtime.
bad,Middle and upper management really don't care about their supposed sales pro's. Fellow salespeople are the real fabric and deserve better.
bad,"Hostile work environment, horrible management (the third shift supervisors are good but the rest of the supervisors and managers are worthless). You make a suggestion to improve quality of parts and work environment and they couldn't care less about them, then they wonder why they can't keep good workers."
bad,"Look to work somewhere else."
bad,The amount of problems here are unbelievable for a billion dollar company. Horrible management none  existent training programs. Pay roll constantly doesn’t put your proper amount of hours or the proper pay scale. They allow supervisors to use racial discrimination and other forms of harassment in every day situations.
bad,productive hard work good supervisor's with bad plant manger ; good pay and benefits ;
bad,"No one wanted to work and when someone tried to make a difference they still complained.  Gossiping all the time, cutting corners, cussing on the floor and finger pointing.  When people are unhappy what can you expect.  Management is the main problem.  They volunteered to tell you everyones personal business.  High turnover rate because the decision makers are the problem.  If you want a check, or you are a robot, then no problem.  If you take pride in your company, responisbilties and have values then keep it moving.  Some of the people who were very talented developed this smile and nod personality.  Its sad."
bad,Workplace is dependent on relationship to get things done in the organization.  Very competitive industry.  Hard to differentiate the products from the competition.
bad,"This is a terrible job for a lot of reasons. The biggest reason of all is it is a waste of time. You will be worked hard, and constantly blamed. They have had 4 plant managers in the last 3 years so that there tells you something. It has been a roller coaster, and almost no one stays longer than a year. The only reason you would want to stay is if you are friends with management, then you are set for a while. HR protects bad management, and management keeps getting recycled every couple years. This place is toxic, and does not appreciate good employees. There has been a problem retaining good talent, because the motivation is just not there. Why would you stay somewhere that treats their employees like dirt? If you work production, you will constantly be treated like you're experience and knowledge don't matter. This job is perfect for someone that wants to constantly let down, dreams shattered, promotions denied for any reason that management can think of."
bad,"Very unsafe work environment  and management concerns. Dealt with all for far too long. Favoritism within shifts, disrespectful management. Company made so many promises and only some were kept. Elgin facility has very old equipment and they expect you to produce at a high rate. The company is great, just that management within the specific plant i worked at had very questionable and unsatisfactory decisions being made and unrealistic high expectations with the equipment given to us"
bad,"One of the worst companies I have worked for.  HQ piled more work onto their plants.  People were starting to crack with all the demands from HQ.  No work/life balance at the plants.  Then the staff were expected to participate in company community activities while trying to keep up on workload.  "
bad,"I wouldn't waste your time coming to work for this company. They are great about talking the talk but they don't walk the walk. If the can get away with something by hiding or denying it well this is the place for you."
bad,"The best thing are the benefits. That is the only positive to this employer.  "
bad,"Management 'fast tracks' their chosen ones.  You can watch them rise up the ladder based on failed projects.  Just before the project is killed (justified), management promotes their chosen out of harms way, then eliminates the remaining employees.  This cycle repeats.  HB Fuller employees hope for a long career is to avoid being added to one of the chosen's projects"
bad,"This is probably the worst company I have ever worked for. They play favorites and don't care anything about the employee. When you read the jib posting it will say that you will maintain desired run rates but what they don't tell you is that each of the mixers in the facility run at different rates. So no big deal right? Wrong mixer 3 runs at 3 the speed of the other mixers. So while u are barely trying to keep up Bc your mixer is running 60 lbs per hour and a typical batch weighs 8000lbs, the lazy people around you will either be sleeping or watching you bust your butt and not even get to take breaks. And to top it all off it takes 2 hours to make a batch so you will run out of glue before you can actually complete another one. There is is no overlap at all which means no time to take a break and the team leaders don't care if you don't get a break because all they care about is there lbs packaged at the end of each shift."
bad,"New employees were often hired on and given very minimal training which almost always led to significant issues.  There frequently wasn't enough product to fill orders on time, and no good process in place to work around it."
bad,The shipping manager could care less about his employees. There is no room for advancement. The pay is terrible for all the work they want you to do and the turn over rate is high because if this.
bad,Customers were 2nd - behind profits . Decisions were made without any input from the foot soldiers on the street. This company did not see any successful competitors as a way to learn.   Issues throughout the supply chain made a long-term effect on customers and loyalty got shattered. They will never be on top or the best in the construction products division due to this .
bad,"The talent level has decreased significantly in the levels of upper management, what was once a support system for us in the warehouse has flipped, and in fact we were training the new management until we were no longer needed."
bad,conduite de chariot caces5 plus chargement et dechargement de camion et preparateur de commande
bad,Micromanaged terribly which makes for a stressful and aggravating work environment. No climate control so it is either very hot or very cold. The culture is not family friendly because you are always short-handed and work long hours.
bad,"Coordinated all shipping and receiving. "
bad,"De mon avis l'environnement était assez dangereux pour travailler mais j'était sécurisé, les horaires était assez souples et l'ambiances assez coules entre collègues. Le travailles a continuités est assez stressant."
bad,No one knew what was going on day to day. It had to managers with conflicting ideas on how to run the plant. I would put in 12+ hour days with no result.
bad,"it was under staffed for 3rd shift and pressured to do lots of work with few people. I would come into work not knowing what I was to do that day. I would either pick, load, unload, wrap pallets, stage pallets, replenish locations or even audit pallets. also receive in pallets too. management would stand over u while u worked and would stop you in the middles of your work to do other random work leaving to pick up ur work when ever u get a chance. they would not even listen to you when u have an issue. co-workers were ok friendly."
bad,"HB Fuller is an established, stable Minnesota company. Until recently there was little turnover with employees, as the working conditions and benefits were mostly desirable. Employees were treated with respect, and were allowed to perform their duties without being micro-managed."
good,"Typical day at Work : Every day work is hectic and disorganised "
good,"Extremely stressful organization, Hindered professional growth, No life/ work balance, suspended benefit, too many middle management layers, Weakness in project leadership"
good,"The warehouse was to busy over night. Had many orders to pick. I wanted to learn the drecso machine, but due to understaffing I had no trainer. Theres wasn't very good communication with the overnight line leader, but i continued to work where I have been."
good,que des personne morose je suis autonome mise an stoïque décharge et charge les camion approvisionner la production
good,"H.B. Fuller provides a unique opportunity to work in the manufacturing world. It is a great place to get your feet wet and get some experience under your belt. However, for how many hours that you work, the pay does not suffice the time put in, at least for salaried employees. There are plenty of overtime opportunities for hourly employees. Weekends during the busy season (February-August) are virtually non existent because you will be working, minus Sunday's (on most occasions). "
good,It is good for starting out your career or for top management
good,Put a lot of pressure on you. Unsafe practice on the from lead. Alot to do in an 8 hour shift. Always gives bad news that brings down the morale of the group.
good,On a typical workday the orders for the customers would vary so it was very anonomious. I learned something new and interesting everyday from saftey down to the compounds used. Management will beat you around the bush every day all day so you never have no idea who to believe. The hardest part of the job was the hummity and long sleeves and pants. The hardest part of the job is when you overheat. Overall the best part of the job was learning a new thing every day.
good,Managers mess up a good company. Coworkers will stab you in the back to protect themselves. Bad decisions cost people their jobs. Need to start over for better.
good,"Good company with good benefits but management wants you to believe they care about you becoming successful at the company but then they ridicule you and the next thing you know, you’re out the door without warning. They don’t tell you why they just let you go. "
good,"H B Fuller window business is a very profitable division of a multi billion dollar business. Unfortunately, no monies are reinvested in improving manufacturing equipment or building space. Quality has diminished lately, and constant turnover in management has resulted in many more customer complaints."
good,going in to work at 10 at night getting off a 6 in the morning. I learned a lot about mixing raw materials together to produce different types of adhesives. The work place was always clean. The incentive program
good,"I enjoyed the work I did, but disliked the culture I was in. Did not appreciate the bickering, gossiping and finger pointing. Felt I was always on the fence and had to prove myself most times. If you weren't part of the clique...you weren't getting anywhere."
good,"flexible on clocking in, good on pto and some time off. However, working in maintenance, time away from work and family time is second tier. Expected to work over and on weekends with barely any appreciation."
good,Poor management styles.  Inadequate skill in recognizing talents.  Little work-life balance.  Not a fun place to work.  The hardest part of the job is that there is always lack of resources and your hands are always tided.  Some of the managers do not appreciate your smart and hard work and will not let you spread your wings.
good,"A good company overall but locally mis-managed. Most positions are semi skilled. Lack of advancment possabilities. Good benefits, poor working conditions requiring heavy labor."
good,"I have learned that the workplace culture that a company creates has a definite effect on jobwork/life balance. I feel this could improve."
good,"did not care about their employees concerns, would refuse to work more than 2 people overnight and very high expectations."
good,"H.B Fuller was a very great place to work. It was a a very hot place to work but, they made sure you stayed cool. Production is high paced so you have to be fast and  efficient and get things done in an orderly and fashionable way."
good,"Current focus is on establishing standard procedures while implementing a new ERP system globally and integrating acquisitions. This is very difficult work. In general, a cross-functional team approach is leveraged to find solutions to these new situations. Working in this way can be very rewarding."
good,"It is a good job to get started with in the industry, but  do not expect to move up quickly.  Friendly staff, a little disconnection from production and production management."
good,"A typical day can result in a very steady work environment or it can be prolonged given missing product for specific orders. The hardest part of the job is doing double work because someone did not properly do their own part, while the easiest is completing the orders in a timely fashion. Learned how to work an RF scanner along with computer assignments such as printing labels for orders. All in all was a decent place to work and gain experience in the Warehouse industry."
good,"Il lavoro mi mette a contatto con molte realtà interne ed esterne."
good,Days are long but worth it in the end. I feel like I accomplish a lot when the day is over. I am always busy with work to keep me on my toes. I have learned a lot about the glue industry since I have been working with them. The people I work for are really good and care for everyone. I would say the hardest part of the job would be nothing I really love all of the jobs where I work! Its very calm and understanding.
good,"currently bought out by H. B. Fuller. it was formally Forbo Adhesives and plant shut down has required everyone to start looking for a job. not very flexible with your life balanced since so much overtime has come about due to employees leaving the job for other jobs in which they got hired for. nothing really hard about the job itself, fairly easy."
good,"Bom lugar para se trabalha, como toda empresa tem seus problemas e dificuldades, mas os profissionais envolvidos na empresa estão em busca de melhorias."
good,"There was little to no opportunities in the Costing group, or into another department. The work to life balance was absolutely ridiculous. There was no work to life balance."
good,There are a lot of good chemists and people that work here.  Many of them are hard working and do the best they can to make sure the company meets their stated goals.  Sometimes the life work balance is not the best.
good,"Temp position. Had some training. Very industrial environment. Would have liked more training. This company is sink or swim, you have to pick up the routine quick."
good,Was a good place to work for the past two years but unfortunately work became hectic and too stressful. Many things have been brought to management andbnothing had been done about the work environment.
good,"Overall, gain valuable experience and knowledge. "
good,Work day entails operating and maintaining three chemical reactors.
good,Enjoyed development of new products;
good,"Not a good culture, they do not valu some depts. Transferred collections to another country. SAP was a joke then they gave people a tiny bonus after getting millions back from SAP"
good,Highly collaborative environment / highly matrixed which slows decision making.  Co-workers best part of job.  Beautiful headquarters.
good,"A minha avaliação é média. Tendo em conta que se trata de uma multinacional americana, sou da opinião que as condições poderiam ser melhores."
good,Enjoyed my job.. Company was bought out and office closed.
good,"Definitley a balanced working envoirment, worklaod depends on the business but usually steady every now and then a bit heavy. The benefits as an emplyee are great but not so much for a temp on the hourly base pay."
good,Not a very appreciative place for efforts with no growth curve to carrer. The hardest part was communicating with my manager and being acknowledged.
good,This was a long commute for me the pay was worth it. The job was real easy as long as you was good in math and science. The equipment they use is new and up to date
good,"HBFuller, Covington facility is operated by people who don't try to understand the employees perspective. there is no real chance for advancement. The employee that deserves promotions, don't get them. It's more about favortism, and who the supervisor is friends with."
good,learn great warehouse skills. with nice people and nice hours off on weekends.
good,Innovative global adhesives company with great work life balance.  Challenging and culturally diverse.  In process of worldwide implementation of SAP.
good,"A lot of times, is a good working place, they focus on safety more,and also production, be careful as a worker, get along with coworkers, listen a go for meetings all they times, safe meeting"
good,"Normal work days are 10 hour days, 4-5 days a week possibly more. Management can be highly stressful, very much a micro management facility but very efficient. Work can be physical but easy employees are pleasant to work with yet drama is big with this company. Pay is well; lots of vacation to start off with and great insurance. Hardest part is dealing with the amount of bull. Otherwise pretty good job."
good,Very fast paced company. Management and co-workers very supportive.
good,"Some of the floor leadership especially 2nd shift Extruding supervisor is fair minded and treats employees well and holds the bad ones accountable, something this company has never seen in the past. Other supervisors are push overs and does not understand the process and procedures. 3rd shift employees are hostile and supervisor allows it to happen."
good,If a employee comes across something out of place or not working properly some won’t even let maintenance know and some ignore the problem completely.
good,"This employer had a decent working environment and offered good benefits.  The pay, vacation and holidays were good.  The facility operated 24 hours and offered three work shifts."
good,My manager definitely encouraged continuing education and got me introduced into NACM. That turned out to be a very good experience for me and gave a great opportunity for networking.
good,"Work with customers to provide solutions to questions they have regarding their adhesive needs. Looking for areas of growth opportunities with clients and providing the good service in responding to their request. I work closely with Customer Service, technical service, sales, labs and plant locations to communicate results or processing of orders. The best part of the job is getting the customer the product they are looking for when they have had issues getting answers before. Difficult days in when I do not get the responses needed in a timely manner which sometimes can take days or weeks."
good,"Had a hard time working here,because costing was the major part of my job.I had given an opportunity to prove to the management to work on costing.And finally i did it."
good,"Management took a turn when they were bought out in 2002, and it chased a lot of the engineering department away, which must have been what they wanted to do!"
good,Overall good place to work but work hours are conflicting.No set schedules.good place to work if your looking for stability.
good,"Every day is something different and rewarding helping customers achieve their goals and objectives.  Being a Strategic Account Manager has brought me a wealth of knowledge on how to build and expand relationships, develop strategic and business plans and help customers reach a new level in production, waste management, meeting monthly or yearly budgets.  "

good,Great place to work.  I enjoyed the people.  Great environment.  Family atmosphere.  Oppurtunity  for advancement.  Enjoy working at this location.
good,HB fuller is a fast pace company that will always keep you on your toes. Teaches you how to a independent machine operator.
good,"This was by far one of most favorite jobs ever! We formulated raw material from start to finish for powder coating applications. I would run the extruder, grind the chips, sift and spray the test hits given to me from the lab chemist and from these hits they could make adjustments and modify the next run for color adjustments or adding more metal flake. Testing hits included oven cures, impact, scratch, adhesion, coating thickness and environmental salt testing."

good,"If you can be a team player, stick to your job, and not make a bunch of mistakes, you can make a decent living at this company.  They are global and have room for advancement if you are willing to work through the difficult times.  Immediate managers respect you if you can handle the job."

good,"Fuller is a low key - easy place to work that makes work-life balance easier.  But I don't see a lot of people development going on here, and opportunities for advancement are limited.   Often sr roles are fill externally."
good,"Na H.B. Fuller tive os primeiros aprendizados da área industrial, aprendi muito sobre planejamento de produção, abastecimento de estoque e logística. Além de aprender que trabalhar com procedimentos facilita e proporciona melhores resultados."
good,"If you get in at HB Fuller, you have done a very good thing for yourself. The only reason I don't work there anymore is because I moved out of state. The people there (I worked in the customer service department) know what they are doing. The managers know what they are doing. At least, this was the case when I worked there years ago. I enjoyed myself there. I had quit once to move out of state, and then I moved back. My former supervisor called me out of the blue one day asking me to come back. I was permanently employed elsewhere at the time, but I jumped at the chance and went back. I was happy there. It was good work, and I always had a full day. It's not the kind of job (at least for my personality and for the role that I had) that you take home with you. Ever. Once you clock out, it's done. I was on very friendly terms with my supervisor and my former supervisors because I was able to be. There was never a time when I felt I was under some kind of scrutinization or was afraid for my job. I got really good raises and sometimes additional raises. There was opportunity to help in other capacities. I learned a lot about customer service to my fellow employees and about really knowing a job inside and out. The benefits were great."
good,H.B.Fuller was a wondeful place for me to grow as a young adult looking for new opportunities. My direct supervisor was a great Mentor and taught me how to lead others.
good,"If want to work hard and nake money to have a better life.. HB fullerbis a great place."
good,If you work hard you can have a real impact on the company- employees are engaged and work hard.  If you bring forward ideas your voice can be heard.  A Lot of opportunity for advancement.
good,"It’s a faced pasted work experience , that provided a steady work and pay check . Managers were nice and work was generally light they where easy going and well respectful"
good,It was a good place to work. I was allowed to do my job with creativity. Many changes in managers would be frustrating in determining company goals. Company tried to adhere to a set culture.

good,"“I get a great deal of satisfaction and accomplishment each day here at H.B. Fuller Construction Products, no matter what the challenge(s) of the day.  The most exciting part of my job is the ownership I feel in working with a group of fellow employees who are all focused on delivering exceptional value to our customers. Our success working on multiple challenges each day is fed by our pursuit of 'winning', teamwork with 'collaboration', and courage to 'do the right thing'."
good,"Great place to work, coworkers are really nice and friendly, makes the day go by faster. It's a big company, but not many locations that I want to relocate to. Management cares a lot about safety of the employees."
good,I would still be there if I could be. The pay and benefits are great and the job is fun and rewarding. I was in charge of the wholesale accounts for the West Coast. At one point I was doing 2 full time jobs there because they were making all sorts of big changes and it was very overwhelming and stressful. Eventually it all worked itself out and I was able to enjoy my job much more.
good,I learned a lot through this company. Management was great. Overall the work place was a safe and enjoyable. They helped me grow as an employee.
good,"Innovative products"

good,"Ambiente agradável de trabalho, com uma equipe de funcionários muito comprometidas com as suas atividades."
good,Good people monday through thursday some required overtime everything is based on your production. Warehouse enviourment steel toe boots required and takes sometime to learn everything and you are constantly moving.
good,"I Enjoyed my time working for H.B Fuller. Everyday we would start off with a meeting that layout tasks and goals for the day so everyone is on the same page. I believe management did a great job in communicating concerns or areas that we can improve in. Co- workers were friendly and worked harder than most which was the most enjoyable part. you were never the only one trying your best or working your hardest to meet the goal, Workers really come together as a team to reach goals and pass them."
good,When I worked for H.B.Fuller I had a good manager. We worked well together and managed to get a lot accomplished.
good,"muy buen ambiente,buen tarto cargos jerarquicos con operarios"

good,"Hb fuller helped me learn how to drive a forlift, Drexel, and standup lift. The work environment was great. Managers and supervisors were really cool. Time went by fast at this warehouse."
good,"I enjoy working for this company because of the environment I was in. I work with great people who made the day go by easily from the conversation we have to the helping each other figure out a problem. I've learned a lot from this company and gained a lot of experience, for example how to be more province on pulling orders and receiving orders to organizing material in their location. The hardest part of the job is figuring out why a certain material didn't show up on the order and trying to figure out if it had already been shipped or removed off the order. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with, being part of a crew who work well with everyone is the greatest."
good,Great place to work for wish it could have been a place to make a career out of instead of temp job
good,Very good place to work.  Everyone is very nice and friendly and they have a very good work & life balance.  Managers are good about providing feedback and direction.
good,"Buen Ambiente Laboral."
good,"-Trained how to process as in mixing chemicals to make sanded/unsanded grout"
good,It's a great first job. Management makes confusing decisions that affect many people in the company. They will invest in training their employees and there are good people.
good,"As a sales person, it was clear there was no central marketing.  You are making it up as you go. That said if you have good ideas, management will give you that freedom."
good,"A typical day at HB Fuller consisted of lots of meetings and busy environment.  The company itself, or the people I dealt with, were great,   but the facility itself was pitiful and honestly gross."
good,"Trabalho mais administrativo voltado a realização de testes e formulações de relatórios técnicos. Trabalhava mais sozinho no laboratório, com presença de meu chefe quando não estava em viagem técnica."
good,"Hbfuller is a great place to be employed. The Supervisors are laid back and fair, I don’t feel micromanaged. He allows the employees chances to prove themselves and truly care about retaining talent and working with them so they are successful in there position, I don’t feel like they receive enough credit for the hard work they provide. I am on 2nd shift right now and at first I felt like I wouldn’t like it Bc I wanted 1st shift however I have grown to learn my team and supervisor and feel like it is a small family. It is a union environment so it is flexible for the people. As long as you come ito work on time everyday you will grow with the company and will make decent money! There’s opportunities to advance but not much for leadership positions! Overall it’s  a unique fun place to work"
good,"Fast moving and functioning job, must be on high alert at all times due to safety. this is a adhesive manufacturing plant which uses different chemicals. Most management and employees are willing to help if needed.You must be self motivated and willing to go above and beyond as needed."
good,"I like the job it's to far for me to drive on a daily schedule "
good,I would love to work here again. Would still be there except they outsource IT to Accenture.
