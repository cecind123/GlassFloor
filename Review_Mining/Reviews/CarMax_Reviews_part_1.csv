bad,"There is no job security with Carmax at all! There is also no clear and concise explanation of what money you earn for incentives. The point system for attendance is ridiculous! If you are even one minutes late, you will receive a full point for that! There is also no grace period! No matter what is happening in your life, you can’t leave early even for family(children) emergencies."
bad,Management is bored with life and make up drama to be entertained then if you have any response they try to make life as awful a possible for you and refuse mandatory pay raises
bad,Wouldn’t recommend them to anybody They told me one thing in return they hired me two months -three months down the road they changed it all and expect us all to live with it I was hired for one shift and Now they making us work a shift that nobody wants to work
bad,Micromanagement at its best! They track how long it takes you to use the restroom and require that you take 5 minutes or less.Pay cuts all around as well. I would save the trouble.
bad,"Does not pay fairly. Managers make less than employees. No room for advancement. Terrible communications. Heath benefits suck pay over $800 for my family. For being the largest used car dealer in the nation you would think they would treat there employees better"
bad,"$160/car, with additional $100 if you sell the extended warranty. If a customer returns their car, you lose the money for the sell of your pay--even if it's a new pay period it is taken from your next check. If you do not sell any cars, they will pay you minimum wage for the hours that you worked, but you will be required to pay it back. I have never seen this at a car dealership. CarMax claims to be about their employees, but have such a high turnover rate."
bad,"Everything they will say to get you in the door is a lie. And many people I've spoken to besides my own experience seems the same way. They try and make it seem like it's such a high morale at the company and that it's awesome to work for CarMax.. that couldn't be further from the truth. The few months that I worked here was terrible. My supervisor was a reject who had just left toys r us because they shut down, and apparently someon.                        There also stole food from the break room. Low. Also very low paye had The bright idea to hire him at CarMax. He was lazy and truly terrible. He made it worse than it already was. People who worked"
bad,"They say they will promote you and don’t  they dangle the carrot in front of your face       . The management has Favorites and do what they want. I guess if you’re a man they treat you well, females get pushed aside."
bad,Only managers are valued they hound you everyday about sales because their commission is off you they just sit at one desk all day hounding you to sale while they watch Netflix
bad,"very low expectations of getting permanent or full time work, hours are totally scattered and all over the place.  other employees are great to work with and great challenges"
bad,Worst company I’ve ever worked for I wouldn’t recommend even applying. Low pay. Terrible hours. Management is the worst. They hire retail managers for automotive world and it’s just the worst
bad,This company doesn’t care about their employees all they want is profit. Manager at Sanford location is unprofessional. Favoritisms is the way to get promoted. If she likes you no matter what you will get the promotion. She generally doesn’t know much about anything. That’s why she doesn’t value people that work but only people that know how to get under her skin. Also if your dad is manager at another
bad,"Very stressful, if you are not available around the clock you loss money because your deals get split and commission is a flat rate not a percentage so it's hard to make a good living."
bad,Corporate Car sales not to the advantage of the sales team...I do not recommend this way of selling cars with their structure.  Too many restriction for the sales staff to make money.
bad,With new Omni Channel the pay structure cut sales consultants commissions to half or a quarter deal in some situations. Will be good place for 19-24 year olds but seasoned sales professionals will not be happy here.
bad,You do the most work in the company and get paid the least. They promote only the ones they can manipulate. You don’t move up based off the great work you do.
bad,"I first began my career with this company after hearing nothing but good things in regards of CarMax. After working there for three years I fully see how they once were a great company but they have become an awful corporation who harasses their employees. The management is very picky in regards to their favorites. If you’re in good with management they will fully support your development and growth. However if you disagree with their point of view on anything whatsoever, they will harass you as a result. I was harassed by management for the past year due to my speaking my opinion on a change within the company leading countless employees within the company to lose thousands of dollars.. As a result I was targeted, singled out, lied to, and ultimately let go. Do not work here, it is not worth your time or sanity."
bad,"What i thought was going to be a great job coming from another part of the company, ended up being a Nightmare! Constant changes in bonus. Nobody can explain or wants to fix. Your targeted if you complain. Not getting paid for everything you sell. They sell you a dream and its a lie! No room for advancement unless your liked. Favortism at all time high! Point system is horrible! No work life balance. Nobody knows nothing! Constant reports being filed on CEC center! Stay away its a NIGHTMARE!"
bad,"Internally promoted managers who you hated in high school who grind down the employees as much as possible, horrible work environment. Managers have no consistency or any idea what they;re doing so they treat call center employees as poorly as possible. Completely disinterested in anything but making themselves look like they know what they're doing and making callers feel worthless"
bad,Pay structure is horrible and hidden from you managers are not helpful or motivating. The environment is depressing and full of homosexuality and a point system that set up for failure. you dont know how much you make they hide it from you
bad,"Carmax recently implemented a new way of selling cars where the salesperson only makes $40 a car... That's right, only $40 a car.   Do yourself a favor and work somewhere better."
bad,"Went into job with high hopes and excitement, and soon had huge let downs.  Had issues with several co workers that included offensive language daily, and harassment bordering on bullying, went to management on issues never was dealt with, never offered alternate solution.  As employee in question had special relationship/treatment.  CarMax says it has good culture but when you work there you see the opposite is actually true."
bad,Dont work here they are awful. The mangement dont care about employees needs. They pay poor and there system works only if you play the system. I do not recmend this companny.
bad,"Worried more customers then employees "
bad,This company does not want real sales people. I spent almost 4 years of my life there wasting my time. If you want to sell cars and be compensated for what you put in then go somewhere else. Management is a joke and the GM will let you know how great they are everyday. The new commission structure is absolutely horrible and a true show of a corporation sucking the bottom people dry.
bad,"Carmax does not care about there employees (sales) the cut the our pay. We only receive $100 for a car. How can you live of that. They expect us to be o.k. with that. Managers and corporate  are still making great pay while Sales the backbone of Carmax suffer that's why I quit. "
bad,This has been a terrible expirence. Every one is paid differently. They lie and avoid answers about pay... it's not even stated on job offer. They make you wear a name tag and complete uniform and force you to buy them. No woman in leadership. Job changes daily. No PTO or Vacation upfront...so you must work everyday. High stressand
bad,"I was written up all the time for made up accusations. I asked for proof and was told it was confidential. So, when I refused to sign the false write ups, later on that day the lot general manager sent a sheriff to my home and accused me of being suicidal."
bad,The customers are great and I used to like working there but they cut my pay so the executives and shareholders could make more money without regards for their sales force.
bad,The company found themselves with a cfo as the ceo. They are currently changing the way they pay sales staff to help offset new cost of call centers. Could not recommend as a good place to work.
bad,It was a very disappointing job no respect no team work. No help when needed getting mistreated or disrespected lack of communication all the above. Dis honest. vehicles not properly cleaned nor fix. Favoritisms. Management not threating the employees. I’ve never seened so many people walking out or getting fired unfairly until I witness it there and experience it I don’t recommend no one working there nor buying vehicles there
bad,Worst dealership I’ve ever worked for mangers are incompetent. The company has ridiculous rules that set up employees for failure not success. Good luck ever getting a significant raise it would take two plus years just to earn an extra buck. What sucks most about the garbage raises is that the company will constantly remind you how much money they are making but never kick some of it down to there employees who are make it that a multi billion dollar company. Corporate red tape everywhere with greedy upper management who will cut corners to save money and screw over employees and customers alike these are the core values of CarMax.
bad,"Management is terrible, no matter how good you do the LPM will always only point out what you didn't do. The only way to advance in the company is to play the politics of the company. Getting advancement is a popularity contest. Many times they will ask you what can make your job faster better and easier but will do nothing with the info. Most requests fall on deaf ears and management shows no interest in helping solving issues"
bad,"They treat workers like slaves unless you’re a sales consultant than your seen as kings and queens. But as a whole, not worth the amount of work you do. Unless, you’re 18 and just need a summer job. Run!"
bad,"To much management turnaround,  never had one for a full complete hear, every time a new manager would come in they would bring new ideas and rules. Work load wasn't there like promised"
bad,Management is lacking. Favoritism is constant there and you’re micromanaged daily. No work life balance. President club sales consultants get to make own shifts while other get stuck with 12-9pm. Commission is a joke and they bait and switch you. Have to sell more than $1200 in cars in two weeks to make commission. Hard to do when you get 160 bucks per car and 100 for warranty. Most can’t afford the warranty as it’s typically 2-6k bucks more. You get bugged by management about cars that arrived on your days off. Health insurance is a joke and very expensive compared to buying it on your own. Go work somewhere else and save yourself the hassle.
bad,"a typical day at work is observed by management all day, i learned that car max likes to push the envelope of repairs with using glue or mix matching tire tread depths etc. Management only looks out for one another manager and the best interest of company and not the employees."
bad,"This company is by far the worst employer I’ve been employed at. If you enjoy to be micro managed every second of your day and low pay this would be the great job for you! You have no work life balance , they don’t care about your needs outside of work. Scheduling makes no sense . I know everyone needs a job but I would explore all options prior to applying for Carmax!"
bad,"Too many women in management positions who know nothing about cars.  Place is worse than high school, sheeple will tattle on you and get you fired.  Carmax is a creepy cult that worships the dark lord."
bad,"I can say that, as a very well-seasoned and successful salesperson, that Carmax provides excellent training and a very thoroughly tested and refined process for the discovery, progression and closing aspects of a customer interaction, throughout the sales process. "
bad,Horrible company to work for. Managers and supervisors did nothing but talk trash behind peoples back. They were very aggressive people. They demanded you work harder but didnt give you tips to improve
bad,"They compare the work a business office associate does to a Cahsier at Target. The pay is extremely low for the amount of work you are required to do. Do you want evenings or a Saturday off? Forget it. The management was horrible and ran many people out of the office. "
bad,"Their corporate structure is a joke and they treat their employees like slaves on a plantation, and dirt. Managers pick favorites and take advantage of hard dependable workers and let the slackers get away with murder. They get sued all the time as well. No haggling is a waste of customer's time as regular dealerships are desperate to sell a vehicle and will haggle. This company is a joke."
bad,"Carmax was one of the worst companies i've ever worked for . i had  racist bosses , they treated everyone different , what was ok for one person to do , is not okay for another to do, it was hard to move up or around the company because they wanted certain people to stay in the same positions. you can get treated badly or talked to disrespectful and nothing gets done about it ."
bad,I have been driving a truck for 14 yrs. I was working out of carmax . I was harassed everyday by one of the fleet drivers attacking me personally and professionally. the driver was not my boss but yet tried to dictate my day of work. I told the managers repeatedly I was being bullied and they did nothing. the driver made up lies about me and I was fired as a result. I never felt so low as a truck driver. they claim a great culture and that they care about there employees and nothing is farther from the truth. they play favorites. the driver pay is one of the lowest hrly wage in the industry. I kept the job because I was the only driver with a set schedule and I was home with my son. the schedules for the other drivers are rotating and you don't know when your working
bad,the payplan for sales consultants is a joke alot of work for minimum wage micro management they dont care about your well being favorism between consultants by the managers absolutely pathetic
bad,Micro Management at its best. Never a dull moment. Salary is 50+ hours. Overly stressful and will take over your life. Trust me its not worth it. Goodluck
bad,I made presidents club and did well. They are now writing employees up for anything and trying to get rid of the ones that have been there for awhile.They don’t care about employees any more.Sad Sad Sad. quality has even gone down hill.Horrible treatment. definitely not the same carmax as years ago.  pay is about to get lower and ultra ultra strict on dress code.
bad,CarMax is not as advertised. Micromanagement is a big issue and the company does not care about its employees. The work environment and work life balance is not good. Upper management is also bad.
bad,"The management at the Tampa location changed and they did not care how many hours you worked and refused to stand up to other departments that would belittle you and your job. They could not retain people; the average turnover was about 6 months. Everyone would dread coming in because they feared that they would be fired on the spot. They all played favorites, and if you were not a favorite you would be treated worse each day until you were so miserable that you quit. Carmax as a company was great, they offered a lot of great benefits and programs. And when covering at other locations, I enjoyed the job. However, the location that I worked at had poor management and most honest people were trying to find new jobs not long after they started."
bad,"Complete lack of management corporate is always looking for a reason to fire you before your 401k is vested so they don't have to pay. This company wants to control your personal life as well. it is very much like big brother out to destroy you as a humane being."
bad,"They don't care if you can/can not do the work. "
bad,"Everyone that works at CarMax doesn't (aside from technicians) have any knowledge of cars at all. Sales people hook jump boxes up backwards just about every day blowing main fuses and destroying ECU's. Management is probably the worse in the service department. They hire managers from places like target to run their shop, then expect them to do ""observances"" on techs even though they have no idea what they're doing in the first place. You also have to tiptoe around peoples feelings here. this is a VERY liberal place to work, meaning you have to watch what you say at all times to not offend anyone. ""benefits"" are probably the worst I've ever seen in a  place of employment. medical hardly pays for anything and its $180 a pay period for a single person. family is around $600.....which in most cases is your entire check. they don't give raises to positions, they do ""cost of living"" raises which is just a few cents. level 3 techs there make a little over $20/hr(in the PNW) which is SUPPOSED to be ""competitive"" to other shops......which is not true at all. average wage for a tech with no ase's but has experience is around $25-26/hr. overall i would not recommend carmax to anyone..."
bad,Very low pay and disorganized management at the Burbank location.  Carmax is a good company and they seem to care about the customers however if you want to make any money then this is. not the career for you.  Burbank has the most sales in the LA area and the amount to be made is very low.
bad,"Everyday was as stressful of a day that I ever had with any job in my entire life.  Management constantly lies to employees and write employees up for any kind of words that may sound like words of the liberal political correctness mob that incite riots, shut down interstates, and airports.  I was fired because I was a targeted conservative who tried to be friendly, cooperative, and helpful to my co-workers. But was stabbed in the back."
bad,"They boast about work-life balance and steady hours but this is not true. There were many times when we were forced to work 50+hour weeks with only a few days notice. No exceptions for doctors appts, children needing to be picked up from daycare or even if you are 9 months pregnant. Be prepared to be watched over your shoulder constantly and constantly ""observed."" You will only succeed and get promoted in this company if you have brown on your nose."
bad,"The most unprofessional, lack of management place ever. Doesn’t know how to treat or speak to their employees. The most disappointing part is that they promise all these good opportunities to you at your interviews and they go against their word. It’s not the employees fault it's the management lack of being a leader. They say they’re there for their employees but they only have their own backs if you don’t have a high position they belittle you. The management will gossip about their employees and they script each other so no matter what the employees say the employees will always be wrong if you have any issues with any of the leads, manager, supervisor, & etc. I don’t recommend this particular carmax cause I can’t speak for the other locations of carmax of how they function there but Carmax of Lancaster I wouldn’t recommend to no one. 10/23/2018."
bad,"never work as management for this company, they are terrible to work for and screw their managers. the employees are under paid and disgruntled. stay away from this one"
bad,"When I started, CarMax was a very different company then when I left. We had fun and were genuinely interested in helping the customer. When I left, management was pushing for more productivity while compensation was being reduced. This was never a 9-5 job but I found more and more as time went on that managers and customers expect you to be available at all times and there really are no ""off days."" They tout a respect for work life balance but that, like a lot of their ideals, is only for top tier consultants. You will be micro managed while you watch the senior sales consultants do whatever they want as they cherry pick the customers they want to take. As much as they talk about integrity I have seen both managers and consultants look the other way to make a deal happen. There may be a great location out there to work at, but I feel as customers have more options available to them it is best to just avoid CarMax all together."
bad,"Mistreated by management, they always played favorites. Even if you put in double the work. Feedback was never consistent. Training was very short and rushed in order to get you on the job quicker than you could actually learn."
bad,I worked there for almost a year they work on the strict  micromanagement guidelines.  They only guarantee you $300 a week.  Show favoritism.  Also  Managers on other teams will try to steal sales away. Other words dont sell cars here they.   If you're not a favorite you will be left  struggling every check.
bad,The ability for a promotion was always on the table if you worked hard enough and paid attention to what they train you to do. Your opinion doesn't really matter though.
bad,You are just a number and they try to over work you for little pay. You don’t get to relax and if you do they find more work for you to do. Managers treat you like a second class citizen. No one is willing to help you out.
bad,"Be friends with the manager, like what she likes, and you'll get hours. They show a lot of favoritism here. Young people crowd. Older heads beware. High school environment."
bad,"The store I was at was not only COMMISSION ONLY, it also had a policy called ""draw,"" which means that if you don't sell enough cars in a pay period you are paid minimum wage for that pay period.  Here's the kicker: that money is TAKEN OUT of the next check(s) in which you sold enough cars to make above minimum wage.  In other words, in the end you are NOT PAID for those hours that you worked.   "
bad,Management does not listen to workers feedback. The work place is a decent place but like ive previously stated the management is horrible and does not listen.
bad,"My fist 6 months I went from the bottom to be a service advisor. Poor management. I had a family member there that bad Mouth me to everyone. Causing work drama for me. Then when I bought my truck there I put down 5,000 cash. I had horrible credit. And I know for a fact that the sales team lied on the application saying I had good numbers. Then my truck gave me nothing but problems. After two years of paying on it on time. It broke down. Forcing me to get it repo it goes on longer. It's just painful to talk about."
bad,bad company to work for does not care about the people just the bottom line.when business is slow don't do anything to try and get customers to come in the door and when you sit there for a minumium of 3 hours waiting and praying for a customer to walk though the door is bad.
bad,"Not only is CarMax becoming more and more like a cult each day, but the mistreatment of employees continues to get worse. Times when water fountains are not working and management won't let you walk to the break room to get a drink. Favoritism between shifts , stores and regions is clear. Make you work in role for months, sometimes even a year before offering you any compensation for it. Benefits are bleh. Changed the vacation policy to an accrual. Won't give credit to rehires for time served but eliminate them from the signing bonus for new stores. Buy your own uniforms and have to pay them."
bad,"This specific CarMax location lacks Communication between department, employees, and managers.  Whats funny is the the rumor mill is highly impactful for others to know each others business."
bad,"Not treated fairly. Race was a issue, and managers were messing with associates who were leveling up faster than others who deserved so. If the management was so bad it would be a good place to work and take on a lot at once."
bad,"Claim that their culture is all about integrity but when an hourly associate lied about a particular interaction and I demonstrated where she lied they still reprimanded me over it, not acting with integrity at all."
bad,I wouldn't even for as long as I live to recommend my worse enemy to work there. Horribly place and management are very poor. I've been there for too long.
bad,"The company lost sight of the most important part, the tenured associates.  I worked at Carmax for nearly 15 years.  I watched them reduce potential income, increase hours, increase responsibility, decrease management staff.  I was required to work no less than 10 hours a day and inmost cases 12.  There was no time for quality of life. "
bad,"spent 6 years there, learned a lot but they under value talent. doesn't promote. You have to buy your own uniforms, they micro manage. Put cheap parts on cars"
bad,Lots of sketchiness between managers at Carmax. Non-reasonable explanations for not being accepted to switch positions. Heavy favoritism and not a proper balance of treatment between employees and managers. There are some employees that get to switch to other positions with no interview while others work hard for interview and still aren't accepted. Poor communication.
bad,We as inventory are responsible for too many things and get blamed for everything when something goes wrong. I think everyone takes inventory for granted but we have to most important job.
bad,"As a sales manager, be prepared to work 50-60 hours a week, being pulled in every direction by every department to execute every task imaginable. The entire store looks to sales managers as the end all, be all. Like their specific departments don’t have managers. And forget about empowerment. They all act like they can’t make a decision and “partner” with a sales manager for answers. Your base salary as a sales manager is less than most production line workers. And you have to be in position for 4 years before receiving a demo. I think CarMax is a great company overall but the sales manager position is the absolute MOST underpaid, overworked, under appreciated position they have."
bad,I was poor working at Carmax. Pay was extremely low. No advancements for growth.  Management heads were unprofessional. Misery Stressful Ghetto Awful.
bad,Managers are caught stealing and somehow get 6 employees fired to save their jobs!!!  Provided proof of the manager stealing and they didn't care.  Was easier for them to fire other employees.. Stay away from this company....
bad,"Carmax is a cult . They tear you down and rarely build you up. They Give you incentives you don’t care about  (like a foam yellow car that is valued at 2.00 on their internal site ) , file reviews are a joke, management is immature and they will let you go for errors beyond your control . They have a certain set of words that you are to use at work like (LIKE IN A CULT) , the only people that are valued are the salaried employees and they do whatever they want because they have job security. They are not family oriented. So if you have a sick child, they better die or you will be written up with the QUICKNESS. Bottom line is run for the hills if you are thinking of applying to such a corporation . Oh and  They’ll give you NOTHING for your vehicle during an appraisal and will sell it for 3x the amount. They only care about money spending customers and the rest will be called “a waste of their time”.  Worst employment decision EVER!!!!"
bad,"Always being blamed for others work when  things went south. Managers are uninvolved in the work, all they carried about was numbers and not their associates. Managers were very poor with their associates and work. You're options never counted in the work area. All the departments were against each other and managers allowed it. Overall store is very poor and all the managers were very unprofessional, never had the carmax culture or integrity. Giving you hops and dreams but never following through with their words. Worst place to work for.  The company and what they do is great but the managers are very poor with the store and associates"
bad,You are promised the world to get you in the door.  Believe none of it.  You will be worked to death and paid subpar.  There is no work/life balance as every moment of your life is sold to this company. Very stressful work environment. The most intense micromanagement I have ever experienced.  Carmax is like a cult in many ways.  They tear you down emotionally and mentally through mission statements and endless IDPs until you are too emotionally beat up and you cower to every whim your manager has and don't question anything that is going on or how many added responsibilities you are given.
bad,"Point system is stupid "
bad,Had very good benefits but management was horrible. Had no type of order in their business. They also had no structure when it came to certain things.
bad,"very poor management. very stressful environment to work in, always demanding more work with little to no compensation. lack of employee support. very poor with advancement in company"
bad,You need to be able to produce high volume numbers with low volume of customers. The managers had unreachable expectations for their sales consultants. I am currently selling the same amount of cars per month with 5x the pay check.
bad,"They are an awful company, they pretend to care about employees but really only care about the numbers and what you do today!!! I would not recommend them to my worse enemy!!!"
bad,Good place to start off if fresh out of school. Good Benefits. Horrible Management and Job Culture. Super high turnover of employees in all departments.
bad,i truly do not have anything to say about this place.  there is no growth opportunity at all unless you are in sales.  Even if you are anyone who matters repairing vehicles you are not treated well.
bad,Bully culture created through policies and lack of management. Dramatics are more important than hard work. Complainers are rewarded while hard work is punished.
bad,"Most blatantly racist supervisors, They claim to want to help you grow but it's all lies. None of upper management seems to have interpersonal skills."
bad,"I worked there for 5 years and it was not the best,management doesn't know what they're doing they promote the people that dont  do anything meanwhile the hard working people get nothing i do not recommend this place as a job also the re hiring rate there is really high either people are quitting or getting fired for something absurd."
bad,"POLITICAL ... WHO THEY ""LIKE"" GETS THE NODD.  was terminated on racially biased reasons. Even people that still work there now are looking for another job. The people who succeed at CarMax love tp step on other people and watch others fail."
bad,"Avoid Central Title at all costs. They have very high expectations for that job and unrealistic goals that are impossible to meet. Then blame you when you can't reach them. So there was over time because no way to finish the work other wise, but then scolded for having OT. I am not a disgruntled ex employee either. I actually did well and was well liked. I just saw it like it is. We ran around like chickens with our heads cut off trying to do the work load. God forbid you took off. Any absent employees meant everyone elses work just doubled. You can't leave till it is done. We ate 30 min lunches to give us more time. Management took long lunches and would come back from lunch with shopping bags, their hair done or nails done. It was a joke. Management was also very cady and gossiped about other employees. Very unprofessional. Do yourself a favor, if you go in for an interview and they try to sell you on this job...run like bears are chasing you."
bad,"their service is very horrible, the people in the work environment are very disrespectful. they do not like to work together, and they show favortism."
bad,"This company did not care about their employees.  No job security. They would fire any person in a heart beat.  It did not matter about what experience you had, it only mattered how popular or what you would do to obtain a promotion. You were always expected to come in to work even if you were sick"
bad,"Used to be a fun work environment until new management started, specifically the Business Office Manager at the Katy location. He does not know his own job. Has to call HR for everything. Will notate everything you do on your own file (will write mostly bad things). He never recognized me for any good accomplishments or any deserving associates. Treats his leads as if they were better than the other associates. Makes a lot of mistakes and does not know the basics of his own job. Micromanaged 24/7 and was very secretive. Was gone outside the office for more than half the time. Was not a team player and rarely helped the office. Definitely not a good leader either. A lot of associates quit because of him. He really does not know how to talk to his associates, always comes off as rude. He changed the office environment and it made it unpleasant to work there. Toward the end of time there I was miserable. He really made it an uncomfortable work environment. Unfair treatment by far and poor management skills. I do not recommend working here with management with no real experience. Also the pay is very low. You're getting paid nothing when other companies will pay you way more. I was getting paid 13.35 for a position that is similar to an HR assistant. Was definitely low balled and don't even ask about raises because they never happen."
bad,They wanted to much out of you with limited tools. they don't make you feel like your part of the team. was not a fun place to work at. management where rude and talked down to you
bad,"They talk about a great work/life balance, but when the up the production goals, forget about all that, and the management is seceretive and shady.  They will find a bs way to fire you if they need to get rid of you because they dont think you fit into the bs culture they have created"
bad,I worked in Carmax for 2 years and there's nothing but drama and negative people. Inventory Associates do so much for the little pay. Also being a inventory associate everyone treats like a do-boy type job. Inventory deals with all departments in the store and get treated like trash. Don't do inventory!!!!
bad,"It was a fun, and enjoyable place to go work, and make some cash about 4 to 5 yrs ago. Since then every year it has gone down hill, starting from upper management down. With the amount of hours a person puts into this place to make sure you make a decent living, you may as well go to a traditional dealer, and make double or if not triple your income. The company brags about how many BILLIONS they make, but can't pay their consultants making sure they make those ""billions"" more per unit."
bad,Poor management all they want to do is laugh and play around.  They have meetings apon meetings and nothing is really said it is just talking in circles. If you aren't in the click they look through you like you are invisible.
bad,Horrible place to work it was like being back in high school and college again. Everyone gossips about everyone. Promotions are only by the buddy system. Not off of hard work and merit.
bad,"Not enough work to support the entire hired staff.Concerns would be noted, but not rectified in a timely matter or at all."
bad,"management team is absolutely garbage, everything is a meeting and a write up. no correct leadership, biggest thing is everyone thinks they own the place can get annoying"
bad,"Hired on as different position, promised to transfer to applied when one opens. They hired externally first for the position promised. Claimed I could not transfer until 6 month period which failed to mention during interview. Management allowed other employees to transfer under 6 months. Over 30 employee turnover under one year. Management was horrible. Mandatory training with no pay."
bad,"I worked for 3 years on carmax as a sales consultant and I was thinking that I was working in one of the best 100 companies to work for like the survey said."
bad,"This company prides itself on micromanaging associates. The only winners are management due to their guaranteed salaries. It is also stressful how associates can lose their jobs due to customer surveys. Sale associates are forced to do free appraisals that they are not paid for. Dealerships send their customers to CarMax to take advantage of the free appraisals. Appraisals are very difficult to sell because CarMax takes $1,000 to $2,000 off of every offer that a customer receives. For example, if a customer is offered $22,000, CarMax offer to the customer will be $20,000.  Sale associates are only paid $160 for each vehicle they sale, so if an associate sells a $50,000 vehicle they will only make $160. Do the math, that is .0032% the sale associates make off of that vehicle. Sale associates are also forced to come into huddles that are not paid and they must merchandise inventory every morning for free. This should not be a career move for anyone that has respect for themselves. The biggest lie this company tell is that CarMax is one of the 100 Best Places to work for. The numbers are fudged to make it seem that way."
bad,"Ok place to work...if you like getting paid 260 per car sale (160 for the car +100 for the warranty) if not you just get paid 160 per car. "
bad,management delegates all of their work for associates who are looking to develop as experiences.  in order to move up you have to be able to speak the carmax lingo and present yourself at a regional location in front of a panel to be judged.  you are not judged based on the work you do daily.
bad,I do not recommend carmax as a career to any honest person who wants to sell a quality product.  There cars barely pass state inspection and they let hidden problems slide. On the outside you may see new ties and shiny paint but lurking down under there are many secrets age problems.  If you manage to bring your car in within the 30 day warranty to let them know of the problem they blow it off as no big deal. You have to pay hundreds of dollars for your uniform and the training program consist of brain washing with a huge binder they give you and say watch these videos and study on the sales floor. Do you self a favor and go to a certified used dealer if you want to sell a actual good product to the consumer.
bad,"company is very easy going, learned a lot about dealing with customers through problem solving and helping financially. Management was ok, great place to meet new people. Hardest part was meeting monthly goals based on the requirements. Most enjoyable part was the pay."
bad,"Worst job in the world. Management is built to constantly show you every mistake. Over the top amount of role plays, meetings and extra busy work with no compensation. The worst hours in the automotive industry and you will likely stay until nearly midnight just to open the next morning. Pay is horrible for the work expected and the company brain washes you into their my way or the highway mentality. Not to mention you pay out of pocket for their clothes you are forced to buy.... Run away. Fast!!!"
bad,Worst job and company ever worked for. Poor leadership and poor training. Does not want to develop people who want a career with there company.
bad,"They do not give highly qualified applicants the time or day if they know you can bump them down"
bad,I loved the job when I first started but collection is not for everbody.
bad,"If you have a great VOC (voice of customer) score, you can do no wrong.  If you have a lower score, get out while you can.  In service we worked off of commission, so the more hours in a work order, the more money you made.  On about 5 occasions I caught a colleague moving around appointments in our system, giving me the lower paying work orders while he took the higher paying jobs.  I brought this to my supervisor's attention (with proof) that he was intentionally stealing pay from me, but I was written up the next day.  (He had a higher VOC than me). Things such as attendance, attitude, work ethic mean nothing if your VOC is not what they want it to be."
bad,"Terrible company to work for. Business Office Management is very unprofessional and inappropriate. Would not recommend company to anyone. When Store Manager and Management is presented with a complaint or a concern no action is taken. You definitely need to be ""friends"" with management for them to help you or listen to you."
bad,It sucks.  Carmax takes the worst of corporate America and a used car lot and combines them.
bad,do not trust them. everyone is shady and only cares about money.
bad,"As the post says, ""Where do I begin?"" Carmax is NOT, I repeat, NOT, for a seasoned car salesperson. You are being constantly bombarded with sales training to the point of feeling like you're back in school. CarMax also has a philosophy of not paying their associates. You get paid for initial training, but that's it. Many people are attending 2 hours of unpaid training each week. Here's the kicker- They require you to punch in to the time clock. This has been going on for over a year now at my location in NC. They also have ""mandatory"" scheduled meetings that last for an hour every few weeks as well. And of course, these meetings are unpaid as well. It is interesting how this company is able to require employees to record hours worked and not pay them for their time. "
bad,Enjoyed working with fellow associates. Needed a change from nights and weekend work. Missed to many of my sons baseball games.
bad,"You will be told many lies when u are hired and promised the world "
bad,"The service manager at Hillside not only got stopped and arrested for DUI while driving a CUSTOMER'S CAR, the car was impounded. The service manager got a very small slap on the wrist and no punishment. Of course he still works at Carmax. He has always been good at kissing butt and it sure saved his!"
bad,Carmax really doesn't care about their employees
bad,As a part time u work odd hours no place for advancment with the low hour avilible and pay is very unstable.
bad,I love the consept of CarMax but your like a Wal-Mart employee you meet and greet people all day for min wage
bad,would not recommend job there.....cant trust management.....they are always looking for a reason to write up there employees
bad,Treat There Emplyees very poorly.
bad,They do not value their employees at all. They do not pay you a living wage in Austin. The management team have no desire to listen to their employees or make it a better workplace.
bad,No work life balance.  No honesty or integrity.  No appreciation for hard work of their associates.  Require perfection in an imperfect job position.  Do not recognize accomplishments if it is not convenient for their objectives
bad,"We used to have E office in order to get our leads then we make the entire commission. Now they got rid of that, hired people to answer the phone & set appointments. Now we get half of the money if it comes from the call center, the call center gets a bonus. Now the managers at the stores are happy because THEY get full commissions! No one is happy, everyone is making less money and is either talking about leaving or is leaving. Are used to think they had our backs now they are stabbing us in our back’s. I will soon say goodbye"
bad,Worst place I’ve ever worked at. Management was HORRIBLE!!! Micromanaged all the time. Was told that I could always be replaced. Manager would tell us that she doesn’t want “cancer” in her office.
bad,"Would never recommend Carmax as an employer or buy another car from them . I am a BBK amputee. If so inclined, I could file ADA complaints with the DOJ regarding a lack of management understanding of and compliance with law . Management is focused on everything but the employee and that has been especially manifested in my experience there as a handicapped person"
bad,Not the best place for a family oriented person. Unprofessional and strong favoritism is shown by management. Required coming in on off days to ensure full commission without splitting it.
bad,"You can make $$ here, but buyer beware of the cr@& you ultimately deal with - corrupt mgrs. Mgrs change your timecards or about how much you sold. NWI"
bad,"Your expected to act in an unnatural & uncomfortable way. You are rated for things you have no control over. It's all about the Carmax image at all cost. Your told one thing in the interview process about the job and income, than reality sets in once your there and you find out it's completely something else. A lot of their clientele are not nice and treat you like your not human. The company speaks about treating the customer with a certain type of experience but does not provide the same experience to the employees. Some of the internal staff have major issues and no one does anything about it. I really don't see any pros in working at the Pleasanton location."
bad,"This workplace environment was like a kindergarten for adults who gets write-ups for anything and getting negative reviews for absolutely none-sense situations by managers and also a lot of intimidation. Not to mention that managers there are always right and you are always wrong in any situation even when they brake the rules and policies. "
bad,This place does not balance family and work life...Periodtttt hey expect you to work longs hours without breaks. Management does not care about you as a person or associate
bad,"To many idiotic bosses , idiots playing favorites.  No actual way to advance without kissing behinds To be happy you would have to drink the koolaid. The other negative reviews here are super accurate."
bad,"Constantly micromanaged from start of shift to the end. Overtime is sometimes needed to complete sales, but management will cut hours later on in the pay period to try and get you below 40 hours a week. Management plays favorites with certain employees and give better shifts and guaranteed sales to the favorites, while scolding the other employee's for any perceived slight or mistake. CarMax is not a recommended place to work."
bad,Highly stressful and draining. The cross functional model is awful. It makes the company loads of money but the associate has to do four jobs but only gets paid for one. It’s so draining always working with difficult customers and micromanage constantly. They put on this illusion of it being a great place to work because of the benifits but job satisfaction among associates is extremely low. I’ve done a lot of extra work for this company and received no extra compensation. This is a glorified retail job that doesn’t pay enough for what the daily task consist of. You’re better off delivering pizzas or serving tables.
bad,Not a good place to work management is vindictive And are always looking for their next victim thay Will throw you under the bus to make themselves look good. You are just a number and that is all you will ever be there.
bad,If you really like being micro managed then this is the place for you.  I was with the company for many years and I have seen many people come and go.  A lot of the issues start with the managers.
bad,"This would be a good job for someone who doesn't have a college education and wants to be an order taker with limited sales experience.  Every position at a store level pays 35% lower than the industry standard.  Most could apply for food stamps and get approved.  It's the Wal-Mart of the auto industry.  However, that would be an insult to Wal-Mart as their pay is better. A typical day at work for sales is waiting in line for a walk in to explain the ""seamless"" process and sell ""C"" grade auction cars that have sub-par in house repairs. Management is either younger and has limited management experience or legacy with no real care for anyone but their stupid reports filled with bad data. They like young people who will be ""Yes"" people and transfer to another location with no concern for commuting or quality of life.  The hardest part of the job is ""selling through"" all of the quality mistakes that they made on the vehicle.  Also selling through their ""Red Line"" financing that is usually 3-5% higher than the Mega Banks through their ""automated"" system.  Some stores will give you better financing on the same vehicle than others due to demographics of that store. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with vehicles of all makes and types."
bad,"Admittedly, I have done some structured sales and management in my time, but this was like a cult, with favorites, and time-wasting meetings. HORRIBLE"
bad,"Higher end paid Corporate driven, they do not care about anyone's dedication. Their stock's holders are number one priority. Your are only any number. Lithia Springs Carmax Sales associate has over a 90% turn over rate.Do not work for this company if you have a family. This is 100% commission only,but they only allow on your 8 hour shift to work 5 hours working with customers to make commission or you will be paid 7.75 a hour. You will have to repay the subsidy on your next pay check! You can make money if you can work 7 days a week."
bad,"not a friendly environment  ,management needs a lot of work ,wish they could be more responsible,the culture wasn't the best no-one really talked to each other"
bad,overworked for the time that you were there. managem was not supportive. they were only concerned about there own personel goals. after selling three cars in one day i got a yelled at for my performance.
bad,This company should offer a salary position not 100% commission. The managers make salary while the staff is stressed and scramble trying to make a sale. This does not provide an environment of morale and the training is based on customer service not actual sales training to close a deal.
bad,there are some great managers at carmax however there are also terrible managers as well.  They want people to fit into a specific idea of what a sales associate is.  Would not recommend as a place to work due to my experience.  I do know people that enjoyed working there i was not one of them.  Underpaid for what we had to do as sales consultants.  Also had unpaid mandatory training.
bad,"Management was young, inexperienced which  had a huge impact on moral and sales.  Mid level managers were young who did not know what they were doing, nor how to manage.  The general manager was equally horrible ......beware!"
bad,"Carmax may offer good benefits, however they lie. the position/work you are expected to do is not the work you will do.  They just want a warm body count. plus they work you overtime, and give you no credit or time off."
bad,depends on management can be a great or horrible job. Good luck different departments maybe you can have a better experience then what I had. you will meet amazing people there.
bad,"When I started in 2003, I loved working there.  It became too corporate and cold.  It was management against employees.  Terrible place to work. Bad management and poorly run."
bad,"Management at this store has no idea what they are doing. You are talked down to, treated with disrespect, discrimination towards race and age is rampant, HR does not help the employee but rather sides with managers and defends them no matter what the charg. Don’t take a job here if you value yourself as a human being. The non-management team is great."
bad,"The CarMax call center is one of the worst in Kansas City. The pay scale is awful, unfair and misleading. The require you to work retail hours when call coverage does not require it. Furthermore, you don’t get real vacation time! Your commission is based on hours worked. If you need time off, your docked a percentage of commission. Your commission is also based in the center performance. If you have a late night shift where 25% of your day is spent not fielding calls, you're docked commission. So you do them a favor and work late night hours to get docked pay. The stores hate the call center so much they even document their disgust in Salesforce, knowing they’ll get in trouble. This is NOT the CarMax people know from the store. This is a place where you’re a number with no future."
bad,"Micro manage and role play you to death want to just give up and many do, write you up for anything trust me stay away.  Tell you your great 1 day and next week your not performing"
bad,"Worked at Carmax for over a year. As many sales jobs, work/life balance was compromised for sales and commissions, but it paid OK. We quite often had to come in on our days off to sell enough vehicles as well as use our personal cell phones at home.   One thing they did not tell us when we began is that we were paid minimum wage (around $500 a week) if our sales did not go over said minimum. However, we would owe them the minimum wage back the next pay period. This was a lie of omission.  Recently the pay plan was cut in half. Most of the deals are split with their Customer Experience centers so it in more difficult as a new salesperson to make over the minimum wage. The management misinformed us about the change in order to keep as many salespeople as possible. Many salespeople and managers left anyway. Although as a customer, Carmax is a great place to buy a car, Carmax  takes advantage of it's sales-force to gain the upper hand in the industry.  You may gain some valuable knowledge of the car sales business, but it is not a great long-term job."
bad,"Called a piece of shut worthless and lazy by a disgruntled employee and I replied with shut the Blank up, and got fired. management belittles and doesn’t help guide you. Mentally unhealthy place to work. Waste of time and sanity."
bad,Corporate has stolen over 40 percentage of my salary since July. Each week I start in the negative $200 to $400.  They now take half of the sales consultant salary if the customer calls the phone number of the dealership.
bad,Mentors and managers do not know how the systems work or how incentives are earned and paid. It feels like a moving target. But designed that only 50 percent of people will get a monthly bonus! Cannot fi d a manager when you really need one.
bad,"I worked for the company for 6 years at multiple locations and I loved it until I transferred to the Modesto store. Favoritism is encouraged creating a hostile work environment. The entire management team made up rules that were not actual company rules and punished you if you did not follow their made up rules. If you replace the entire management team it would make for a much better work environment and less of a soul sucking experience. I have never seen a management team not wanting to sell cars and standing in the sales consultant's way at every turn. Anonymous calls to HR only result in targeting the employee who complained about unfair treatment resulting in a fear based environment to even say anything about the treatment. If you do use the ""open door"" policy especially to complain about treatment from a specific manager they just make excuses and cover for each other. If you are not one of the management's favorites expect a miserable working experience and dread going into work every day."
bad,"I was very happy and prosperous at Carmax for over 3 years. Their recent change to a call center format, promising us more qualified and progress customers, has been nothing but a lie. Along with the big assurances, they cut our commission for any customer that uses the phone or internet. Resulting in a 30-40% loss in overall earnings. Now we have less in the paycheck and customers coming through the door that don't understand why they've talked to multiple people or couldn't get anyone to answer the phone. Many sales consultants are looking elsewhere. I would advise against applying with Carmax or even staying."
bad,"You get the snot beat out of you every day with no respite. Repetitive menial labor unless you are fully ASE Certified. No room for advancement. Overtime is scheduled and mandatory. You can accrue sick time but are not allowed to use it. Call out system is to a voicemail box, which is frequently deleted without being checked.."
bad,"Take out the higher ups, this could be a great place to work. We have lost so many good people at my store due to the lack of quality leadership. Turn out rate it staggering. We lost 7 department leads and managers in the last year."
bad,"At charlotte location on night shift you'll have a little girlwith no knowledge of vehicles telling you how your job should be done, at the same time she'll be on her high horse barking orders and harassing you to do so. Upper management will back there managers when when in the wrong. If you go to them for assistance or issues you'll be the one out the door. F**k carmax. They glue there cars together no joke"
bad,If you only do appraisals then you work for free! Only if the customer Sales their vehicle will you make money. They hire too many sales reps where you can not make good money. If your retired and have a second income then apply here. Don’t expect to make a lot of money.
bad,"The company creates this false reality that everyone is  killing to work for them. The pay is low and I felt like the place was full of ignorant mediocre men. These are the guys who think they know everything but really they are underachieving and small thinkers. "
bad,"CarMax likes to act like they value their employees, however they treat everyone as replaceable. Once someone is not liked, they start to ""performance manage"" them to get them out of the business. Additionally, they have  ZERO tolerance about talking poorly about the company. Seriously, do NOT talk poorly about any negative experience you have had. Even if it was in your personal experience and off the clock as a customer. Even if it was CarMax that made the mistake or messed something up. They will NOT tolerate it and will terminate you under some loosely laid out policy."
bad,"This company likes to hire the disabled, unemployed and older candidates in hope of getting tax credits or breaks.  One of the first things you do is respond to a phone questionnaire about public assistance that you may have been receiving before going to work there."
bad,"run away...mean managers. Deceitful company on every aspect both to employees and customers. You get written up for 29 minute lunches, has to be 30. written up for leaving 1 minute late, basically, you are constantly penalized for any pride in work you take. Constantly ridiculed until they beat you down!"
bad,"Carmax is really the Walmart of car buying, specially when it comes to their employees. The maximum pay for hourly associates is $15, sales consultants only get $160 per car sold. Employee turnover is extremely high with most associates complaining about working there. The hours for managers went from 40 to 50 per week with no compensation."
bad,"When I was first interviewed, the job seemed to be a great fit with a wonderful work environment and employees. I loved my job for the first year; however, new management made the work environment awful. After almost two years with the company, they decided they can no longer with with my school schedule and have basically given me no other option but to quit once school is back in session. In the business office, you do not get paid enough for what is expected of you."
bad,Okay to make a few bucks and get out quick. Too many salespeople and not enough customers. Managers are incompetent and on some days really don't help.
bad,this is nit a good place to work management is terrible- no room for advancement-one good thing is everyother weekend off however you usually have to work it
bad,If you like being treated like a 3 year old than this place is for you. This dealership is becoming a typical box store meaning the only thing they care about is money. Employees have become a # and that is all. They think giving you cookies and ice cream will make you happy. No loyalty to employees what so ever.
bad,"I highly do not recommend working for the Southwest Freeway location. Management has lack of support for the staff in the business office, and all the customer reviews were based on customer's experience at the store as a WHOLE. The sales person could be the one to mess up, and the bad review will impact you as well, when you didn't do anything wrong. "
bad,"I do not wish to speak ill of individuals , at the time I was there we had a very poor management team, Maybe it has since improved. The have many ways of interpreting the way you get paid"
bad,"The title says it all...unpaid training multiple times per week, multiple reviews per week, little encouragement.  It's all about the numbers the General Manager can put on his little piece of paper...They haven't changed the commission structure in years - you are paid a flat rate for each sale.  You will spend half of your day appraising cars for little or no compensation.  Not a great place for a seasoned sales professional...they want to mold you into their robot..."
bad,"You will not have a life working full time here, management picks favorites and if you stand up to them they will treat you differently. Carmax itself has good values, but management does not hold up to those in store level. You are expected to not make any mistakes and when you first start they tell you everyone is human, they make mistakes and we can fix them, but they lie. They take advantage if you’re hard working, will throw all tasks at you and expect you to get them done in your 9-10 hour work day, but also help the abundance of customers that come in (this store is super busy) the best thing about this job is the benefits and when you really look plenty of other jobs have BETTER, MORE AFFORDABLE insurance. This job will stress you out, emotionally and mentally. Be prepared to work every single weekend, with very little rotation to be able to get a weekend off. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone I actually cared about. One great thing about this place is my coworkers, they’re awesome and support me and actually tell me they appreciate me, but you won’t get that from management unless they happen to favor you. Also expect to be asked to stay late every single day, you will never get off on your scheduled time they give you."
bad,"I felt like I was in high school, you have the mean girls, the jocks, the nerds and the drama group, it was a horrible experience everyone looked out for themselves, horrible training and lack of understanding managers."
bad,"Very casual environment where sales man are the only ones that get paid commission. This means that everyone else gets paid to just show up. Which ultimately affect the quality of cars which affects the cars sold, which affects the amount of money the individual sales consultant brings home and with an extremely lenient 5 day return policy, it allows a 5 day window for the sales associate to be without the money he/she just made. Also, with an extremely unfair policy of ""treating employees and customers with respect""; it makes it very easy for other associates and customers alike to fabricate or over exaggerate qualms because they know it will most certainly guarantee you get disciplinary action. At Carmax you are guilty until proven innocent."
bad,"Went through their interviewing process. I have been in the sales industry for 12+ years. I have never seen a sales company so automated, like robots before! Every   question you ask has to fit in line and at a certain time during their script. The atmosphere is like a well organized Target store for vehicles. No personalities or flavor at all in their people. Very dry and boring culture from what I can see. Showroom is so awkwardly quiet and stale. Also, interview process is extremely long and overdone. You have to do an online assessment first and pass that in order to move on to their next phase. When I finally was past the first phone interview and invited for a face to face interview, I walked into robots instructing me to answer more questions about my background history on the computer terminal of course, so in depth I though they were going to ask about my history in primary school. I already gave them permission during the online screening to do a background check. Had to upload a utility bill as well. LoL Questions like when was the 1st time you tried alcohol? and have you ever smoked marijuanna or do you know sombody who has before?"
bad,"Your whole life becomes Carmax. You will be under constant observation and be given correctives. Nothing is good enough. Pay is horrible, worst in the industry. I was written up for a bunch of untrue accusations because I was a female. If you want no life apply at Carmax. The place is horrible"
bad,"They do not welcome new hires very well.  Most of their training is online with very little follow up and there is very little room for mistakes.  You will be assigned a mentor, but the mentor isn't trained or is more concerned about their own duties than with assisting you with understanding the business. Overall this make their training a little weak but their performance management strong, meaning if you don’t pay GREAT attention to detail, you will be out of a job very quickly."
bad,"Must PC in order to advance . . . evaluations completed on ""here say"" rather than factual observations. Must be ready to make quick decisions & live with the back lash from outside management."
bad,"A company that advertises and promotes itself on Forbes Top 500 Places to Work does little to back it up. After I asked what turnover looked like in my initial interview I came to find it was much different from what I experienced firsthand."
bad,"If you like drama, being treated like garbage by Managers, if you love gossip and injustice, if you like working hard and not being recognized for it but if you like to brown your nose, this is the perfect job location San Diego for you."
bad,The job was flexible when it came to scheduling as long as you were  a premier sales consultant. Moving into management isnt difficult but can mean a major reduction in pay. Compensation is fair if your are a good salesman but focusing too much on the job itself can get you fired. You must be everyone's friend and be mediocre at your job to fit in and have some chance of keeping your job. If you are a good salesman people will hate you and try to get you fired. The structure is slightly different in terms of the compensation pyramid.
bad,"Carmax has to be the most downright unprofessional company in the top 500 Corporate Jobs listed in Forbes Magazine as one of the best Companies to work for. They blindly rob customers of the actual value and worth of a customer’s vehicle; they sell lemons and do not reveal that to the customers. They take bad car parts off of other cars and place them in these ""certified pre-used"" vehicles or they don't bother fixing mechanical problems at all. As for the employees, Carmax states they honor their ""open door"" policy without there being retaliation. This is not the case. If any employee is to file a complaint towards or against any Management, they will find ANY reason to fire the employee. Health Benefits are not even worth getting. You pay more out of your pocket than what the insurance is willing or should cover. The only way you'll receive recognition at Carmax is through this ""rating"" system they have where they base your quality of work off of customer reviews and how many cars you sale in a month or how many contracts you sign. So it doesn't matter how far you go out of your way to help a customer or an employee or how well you work with others, if you’re not producing ""five stars"" then you’re not a good employee.   "
bad,"I was retaliated against when I spoke up, they offered me to keep my position, yet those who were wrong were still thier with nothing being done to them"
bad,You are very replaceable. Treated with no respect. work long hours for 7.25
bad,"Initially Sales Consultants were allotted 3 hours in ""e-office"" where consultants would accept ""random"" leads from potential car buyers. Afterwards we would work the floor and assist walking customers for another 6 hours. You were allowed 45mins for lunch but you are not urged to take a lunch. They rather you work 9hours straight which we would consequently have to do in order to have a chance at making a reasonable amount of commission."
bad,"I worked at store 6021 for nearly 6 years and was fired  over the actions of another individual.  They were cowardly in their actions and ended my career in an instant. They were cold, calculating and callous. They play favorites and the managers are very inept"
bad,CarMax does not want to pay you properly for your efforts. Pay was cut in 2019. Now you have to sell twice as many vehicles in order to get your usual / average pay. Internet leads are split with the company. The company markets and promotes going online to do every thing. 85% of customers are internet leads. You can sell 4 cars and make about $250. Sickning.
bad,"If you miss junior high school drama, Carmax is the place for you. Also a great place if you're lazy, bitter about life, have a felony record, and/or a snowflake."
bad,"On mandatory OT since August of '18"
bad,Very corporate job that is doing everything they can to make more money and insure you that you won’t be paid based on your drive or dedication. It’s changed now where it’s pretty much equal pay across the board. So if you skate by and don’t need to make good car business money this is the spot for you. Management was atrocious! They could care less about you the employee or the customer all though Carmax is suppose to be so up front honest transparent....all blatant lies!!!!
bad,"When you fight for your rights you are targeted, you will be terminated without an investigation of any kind. Some managers are to caught up in their ego."
bad,During my time at carmax as an inventory lead I had multiple teams of people come through constantly firing or having people quit for one reason or another. The pay is decent until you start getting the increased responsibility. Management pushes their tasks onto you while they hang out in each other's offices talking most of the time unless something goes crazy. After being promised promotion from within when a management position became open the operations manager hired one of his friends from a previous job rather than promoting an associate who had been with the company. The workload in inventory was constantly being added to while not hiring additional help or adjusting goals to suit the increased amount of time to get all tasks done. They very much wanted to have their cake and eat it too. Many positions from other departments had their responsibilities moved to inventory. Managers were not very open to new ideas or suggestions. The benefits are able to keep people for longer than they would like to be there but the environment is mentally and physically very taxing.
bad,"I don’t know if I’ve ever worked for a more corrupt company.  Management tell you to your face that they care about you, then talk behind your back and fire people left and right for reasons simply inhumane.  They are not willing to work with you whatsoever, even if your 1 year old daughter is hospitalized from a peanut allergy from the first time and you have to call out, or when your son passes away from a rare disease, (neither cases were my own but associates I worked with) they expect you to be there because leaving “adheres to their attendance policy” and it “interrupts work flow” because all this company truly cares about is money.  Choose to go home in those tough situation and not only do they guilt trip you on the spot, they continue to hold the time off that you use against you.  Actual quote from our Line Production Manager: “Your sick time is your time, you use it when you need it because you work hard for that time off.  But we have to stop taking so much time off.”  And believe me when I say the call out trends they constantly mention besides a very few people are not anywhere near as bad as they make it seem. They offer “discounts” just cents less than you can get the same items literally anywhere else.  How helpful.   Will make you work outside in hurricanes too, have done it on three separate occasions. Management picks their favorites and do what they can to get those individuals above the rest, and find ways to make other associates lives difficult, often firing them for laughable reasons, because it’s all about who’s in the right “friend group.”  If you"
bad,"I worked at the Glen Allen location for years, the senior management is awful and does not care about employees. The starting pay for 3 different full time positions is below poverty for the area. They cover it up with a decent benefits package, however, the health insurance is too expensive when you make so little. I would not recommend working in a Carmax store. The cooperate office is much better."
bad,"Managers do not care about their employees, all they care about is performance, once your performance does not meet the requirements they will do their best to get rid of you"
bad,"Pay sucks, People are just trying to get through the day. Management is Nice and understanding. Overall the company does not care about you. The Drop Out rate is worse then call centers. Good if you are just looking for a job and you can purchase a vehicle For personal Use through wholesale after 90 Days. Great if you need a job for a couple of months and a car."
bad,Most stressful job I've ever had. I felt like I didn't matter and wasn't appreciated. Constant pressure and emphasis on using low quality/used parts as cost savings measures. They'll cut your flat rate labor time whenever they feel even though the time came from Mitchell On demand.
bad,"I was accused of not being honest in a situation where it was one associates word vs. mine, the associate lied about the interaction and to get out of trouble threw me under the bus as a manager in training.  I counted on the investigation to let the truth come out...big mistake she was believed over me due to the length of service she over me.  Not honest at all."
bad,"It was an easy job. Therefore, my manager treated myself and the other temp employees like trained monkeys. Turnover was high because the manager didn't know how to be a manager and help their employees. There was no job security. If the manager didn't want you, they would make up lies to get rid of you."
bad,"CarMax does a great job at hiring really good people who are fun to work with, they were the most enjoyable aspect of the job.  Unfortunately, the pay for a commissioned sales associate is the lowest I have ever experienced.  The associates who make a decent paycheck practically live there.  The schedule is awful as well, since you only have one weekend off in a six week block, kiss your friends,family and social life goodbye.  Also, management is constantly monitoring everything you do, total micromanagement.  I would never recommend working at CarMax to anyone."
bad,"The buying management is absolutely horrendous. They micromanage, belittle, and harass their coworkers, making it difficult to do the job properly. Monthly file reviews gives the manager to go over every little detail of your job performance that month."
bad,"managers and leads are horrendous, job is easy but they make it difficult by adding unnecessary tasks. i at least learned alot about vehicle detailing in my time with the company"
bad,Can be a stressful role at times because the company does not truly support its brand promise of completely reconditioning vehicles. The vehicles in the Northeast do not go through the reconditioning process that the company advertises. There is a strong lack of accountability to mechanics that do not properly recondition vehicles.
bad,"CarMax could be a fun and great place to work depending on manager. My first manager was a team player and always available to every issue that irises, motivated and supportive of your progress. Current manager is always micromanaging and pointing finger if you do something wrong they will notates every mistake in their accuracy score card or IDP file and will mention HR in every discussion. Did not work as a team player and knew very little of the business office procedures. Not a TEAM player !!!! A lot of favoritism and not appreciation towards the hard work you do. They pay is very low compare to other dealership and the amount of work and responsibilities: title clerk, DMV registrar clerk, customer service, receptionist and more.... Salary was 10.50 per hour"
bad,"Promotions are based on who you know, not what you know.  It is a revolving door in inventory.  The first and second level of management do not have a clue.  The rate of pay is horrible.  I wasted two years of my life here.  Do not make the same mistake that I did."
bad,Managers do not know what they are doing. Promotes undeserving workers and praises them for not doing anything while you work hard! Cooks food sometimes for the workers.
bad,The management is overbearing and likes to micro manage constantly. I feel as though Carmax should screen their management personal a great deal more. Carmax should also compensate their employees more for the amount of time you have to put in for the payout you receive. I would not suggest Carmax as a place of employment.
bad,"only care about sales goals, not happiness of employees. All training is done on a computer, even for hands-on things. No direction from management, they are more concerned about planning the next party or complaining about a lost sale (due to overpriced unreliable vehicles)"
bad,"Carmax will tell you that you are going to get commission but then find ways of not paying you.  You will not get paid for what you sell, you will also have to split your commission with other reps who interact with the customer if the call back in. They are liars.  I busted my butt for this company for months coming in early & staying to do OT and was never compensated. I was warned by previous employees who was in the  classes before  me. Huge  turn over due to them not paying.  Trainers are great but don't expect to  make anything but base pay"
bad,"Terrible place to work. Managers play favorites, lie, and overall are a bunch of ametuers. Nit pick every little thing then let the big stuff go right buy."
bad,"Difficult to move up in"
bad,"The managers in detail always have points especially if you are pregnant and needed to go to the doctor or if you aren’t feeling well. They don’t promote you every 6 months as they promise you and the managers keep nit picking at every tiny thing that you do while they stand around and do nothing. If you want to transfer to another department and you apply for it within the company, they managers don’t even look at it. They lie about your pay being on the next check as well."
bad,"not a place to make money the cars are very spensive maintance on inventory is very poor, very sloe traffic of customer, old computers old phones in offices"
bad,"Upper management changes in the past few years clearly indicate it's about the stock price and not the workplace. Every department is systematically being directed and pay reduced. I would no longer recommend and honestly I don't even enjoy going to work any longer."
bad,Relax working environments but poor income. Employees discount on purchasing cars. Benefits package is not as good as other companies. Lots turn over.
bad,"The company has recently changed strategies and by doing so has cut sales consultants income by 30%. Initially, management told us it would not be a dramatic change. However, once effective, the change lowered income by 25% and made it far harder to qualify for club status therefore cut pay again. Carmax has lied to and swindeled their associates to the point of depravity."
bad,Policies are not always followed. New leader decided he didnt like me so looked for any opportumity for corrective action. Aproved outing (by the gm that fired me) after the outing he terminated me for the golf outing.
bad,"When I initially started at Carmax I thoroughly enjoyed the people I worked with all the way up to management.  The workload was fair and balanced and we knew what was expected of us.  Since then Carmax has made cuts company wide and supplemented salary associates with hourly.  Hourly associate positions have been cut in half in our department and the workload has fallen on the shoulders of the few remaining employees.  Associates are not paid fairly for the increased workload even when other positions have been cut.  There are no merit based raises so you can bust your a** all you want and your coworker can disappear  for hours during the day and you'll both get paid the same.  Morale continues to go down in the workplace and management wonders why.  Don't waste your time working here, there's no room for advancement whatsoever."
bad,I enjoyed working there until they changed their management team. They have an open door policy with management but as soon as an employee brings up harassment issues they protect the manager  dismissing the employees concerns.
bad,"Management is always looking for something to get you in trouble, will let you go for any little reason. Not paid enough for everything they ask you to do. Will give you any type of schedule to cover the week."
bad,"Commission sales environment. The people who were able to make money often worked 10+ hours/ day and rarely took a day off. They claim to be a low pressure environment although every week we were required to go through training on how to pressure customers to buy. There would encourage you to be yourself while at the same time demanding you follow a script, especially on the phone."
bad,"hours getting cut, managers act very shady towards associates. lots of drama and gossip going on. no room for growth. management gives you poor excuses when trying to move up within the company."
bad,"At first, everything was fine. They were understanding about my pregnancy. Then, as my pregnancy got farther along, my memory was struggling more and I would get in trouble for not being able to remember everything all the time. Certain people in management seemed to target me with""constructive criticism"" and they allowed others to slack off and disappear while on the clock to go socialize while myself and others had to pick up on the slack and miss breaks and go hours without being able to get water."
bad,"Management pretends mandatory overtime is a surprise. The work is also intellectually deprived which seems to attract a certain group of questionable intelligence who make their way into management positions because they don't mind the senselessness of the place and have been there long enough to outrank their peers, generally two years. The turnover rate is rather high--I imagine it's because the job description for the title is misleading and the availability listed on your application that is present in your interview means absolutely nothing. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless you enjoy physically arduous work without competency in management or co-workers. The only consolation for the endurance of such misery is the pay."
bad,"CarMax is a big company that is consistently growing. And the time I work there they've built hundreds of stores. Sales associate are paid horribly the lowest in the entire industry Nationwide [$160.00 per car sold]. The hours are extremely long and even after working hard to close a sale your money is not guaranteed. CarMax give devary customer a five-day window to return their vehicle. What they call buyers remorse. But that leaves all sales consultants in limbo with their money every cell every month every week. Though it can be a fun challenge, it gets tiring and it is not and healthy environment to work in. There is tons of favoritism and management tends to turn the Blind Eye to top sellers. I wouldn't discourage anyone from at least trying, I did. But it's definitely not something I would recommend you doing if you need steady solid income."
bad,"Horrible management style who promote based on the buddy system instead of merit. They cut corners on vehicles to cut costs at potentially the cost of customers safety.  They bonus based on cost cutting versus the shortest amount of time to rehab a vehicle. They only care about how many cars they produce/sell not how well they treat the customer. They have a goal of 25.4% comebacks of the number of vehicles they rehab. Think about that, 25 out of 100 or 1 in 4 will have a mechanical defect and need to be returned to the dealership for repairs."
bad,"Don't believe the ""be yourself"" pitch from management.   All training is focused to turn you into a lock-step robot.  Swallow the kool-aid and be prepared to work beyond 40 hours for success.  Great if you thrive on micro-management system."
bad,"Use to be a great place to work, every year it falls farther down the list of top 100 great places to work.  It's getting to big to fast and has a lot of unqualified managers in key positions that have control of your career."
bad,Pros
bad,"Carmax used to pay well, until the new omnichannel came along. The pay plan was just cut in half. I went from $70k a year to around $36k a year for selling the same amount of cars. Great for the shareholders... bad for the salespeople."
bad,"Over the two years that I spent in sales and reconditioning at Carmax, the compensation was cut for multiple different departments. For sales, the in store associates no longer receive internet leads. All online leads for sales are handled by a call center in Atlanta for our region and all sales generated by the call center receive half commission. This caused a lot of the veteran associates at my store to leave for other dealerships because a large portion of our sales came from online leads. In order to make the same amount of money, the associates had to see twice as many customers."
bad,"If you really want to make money there, you have to live there. Open to close, taking every customer that just wants to test drive or have one paystub in six years. Then you have managers who could care less if you are doing the most shady things, as long as you're selling cars...shade away. Customers call and come in anytime they want and if you are not there guess what, they dont care. You will lose a sale or have to split it (shadiness may vary). Some of the co-workers were super cool but others were so dismissive it made trying to talk to them repulsive. The business office moves like they are in the 1940's. And NO, I don't want your E-Office shift!"
bad,The only way you going to advance is if they like you. They will come up with a collection of things against you just to fire you. Especially if they don’t like you. If you looking to work here that’s fine as long as you don’t apply to the one on Capital Blvd in Raleigh don’t Waster your time in operation and inventory. You’ll hear how much better the other CArMax stores are compared to that store. Inventory have a high turn over rate.The other CArmax stores will work with you this one will not. They will make up reasons to be lazy claiming the more you move up the less you do. It’s a reason for them to be lazy
bad,Managers do not in force rule of cherry picking they look the other way.Some associates have very low morals.They will steal your client and later say l did not it was your customer. Bull
bad,Act like they care about its employees but has a high turn over rate.  Has set process in place but not all the store follow them.  Change management techniques every 6 months with different training
bad,"CarMax stared out great! But it went down hill fast. They tell you to focus on workday and make sure it get filled out but yet they give you no time to do it during the work day. They hired outside people for higher positions instead of promoting within. Played favorites. Management was good at the start, but got worse fast. False promises about promotions. Gave feed back multiple times a day and only focused on the ""inconsistent"" reviews to meet a quota. Leads and management would get upset if you went above and beyond. Super strict rules for what you do outside of work ie,Cant do side work. If you had personal vehicle problems on CarMax property you had to have a friend tow you out of the lot before you could open your hood. If you had your own personal vehicle being worked on at CarMax you were not allowed anywhere near it nor where you allowed to talk to the tech working on it, all communication had to go through the service advisor. CarMax provided all the tools for the jobs that need to be done. Overall I would never recommend working for this company or specifically the location in South Jordan Utah."
bad,"Not a very organized place.  Processes and layouts are all over the place.  The people run the place more than the managers and there is a lot of corruption amongst the teams.  New people hired all the time and not enough pay.  Good idea for the company to start and grow and could be a fun place to work, as it was for many years, but not anymore!"
bad,Not a place I would really think of working that long for. It doesn't really pay that well. Not some place you can make a lot of money doing. The management expects a lot.
bad,"First of all. All good revues are fake "
bad,"The store is a great place to start a foot in the door kind of career, the operation manager is VERY inappropriate and crude. He's the definition of the worst manager to work for or even be around. The job is great to learn hands in training,  the associates  made the job and fun and actually want to go to work.  There's no point to have a operation manager here because you never see him and does no express the carmax culture."
bad,"When I first started, I loved going to work. We always had a good time and stayed busy. After a couple years, management changed. And it just kept getting worse"
bad,"I have been working at CAF for almost 2 yrs & it has become draining. The work environment is so stressful. They despise of you taking bathrooms breaks & calling customer back. If you miss work due to an unforeseen circumstance (i.e., family, health, kids, personal) they will trip forever about it. The managers like to dwell in the past & overlook improvements. I would only recommend you work at CAF part time. Part -time & full-time workers get the same pay, but part-time gets less hours."
bad,it is not worth it to work for this company in detail when the only way you get promoted is by flirting with the ugly cosmetic manager or have a friend who has an intimate relation with the operations manager. Old cars with a lot of defects that need to be perfect and racist managers.. the only way to get promoted is by kissing a%$....
bad,"At the location I worked, ever manager was on their own page and did their own thing. There was zero unity."
bad,"You really have to play the game and be a ""company"" man to get a head at CarMax. Good pay but you need it uf you are going to get benefits for you family."
bad,"Your a number, if they could replace you with a robot they would. The bottom line means everything and they give lip service to quality but care nothing at all for quality auto repair. Numbers are all that matter to Carmax. "
bad,Terrible management.  If you are searching for answers is better to ask for help to your co-workers than the managers. Co-workers are much knowledgeable and willing to help you.
bad,After working at carmax for a long while I had seen many people come and go. The ones who stayed were the ones who could remain in the “cliques” and get away with most everything without management caring much because they were too focused on numbers. The ones who were not pushing numbers as well would be micromanaged and constantly be called in for “curbside chats”. They are more focussd in getting a car sold then their employees to be frank about it. I did enjoy helping my customers and trying to do better for them. However. Carmax gets away on their “no haggle process” if you are able to do your homework and not make a jump decision you can always find a better deal then what carmax can offer. This included the financing and the quality of vehicles.
bad,"I worked there for 3 years and I can say it was not very pleasant. My direct supervisor was always in a bad mood, and the shop manager was, in my opinion, racist as he would always stereotype African-Americans and Hispanic employees. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
bad,Detaileing is fun and entertaining. You get a satisfied sensation when you finish the vehicle you’re working on. It only gets tough when you have an extremely dirty car and you spend almost your entire shift on it.
bad,"Interact with customers, other associates and team members to provide outstanding internal and external customer service."
bad,As a Sales Consultant you will:
bad,Due to recent changes the commissions for sales consultants has recently been cut in half. CarMax now has a Customer Experience Center. If anyone calls into the store or does anything online they are instantly a CEC customer and if they come into the store and purchase the sales consultant will only receive half of the commissions. Now sales consultants will have to sell twice as many cars just to make the same as they once were.
bad,This is a fast pace environment if you can deal with customer flow. A lot of information to learn and retain. The pay is not worth your job requirements. The sales team (managers) and LGM are a joke. They have no clue what to do on a day to day basis and it shows even to customers. It’s really embarrassing.
bad,"CarMax brainwashes their employees to fit a certain culture. If you are a free thinker, CarMax is not the place for you. The management team will stretch your role beyond a reasonable amount of time and not compensate you for the position they stretched you in."
bad,I worked in purchasing for the better part of 2017. The pay was pretty awful for the amount of work required. There were many days that the Buyers were simply lazy so they would pass work off on the BAs and we were just supposed to do it. There were clear favorites in the purchasing department and I felt it daily. A lot of false promises from management and even accusations made against me that were unfounded but I had no way to defend myself from them since I was just the “new guy”. Every one I started with ended up leaving/quitting and I was lied to about how easy it would be to be hired at another location upon me moving to another state/city and alas it seems with even experience and my good record they won’t rehire me. The company culture is very cult like and once you leave that’s that your out good riddance. The sales staff were very lazy and uninformed about the appraisal process. Not a job for future advancements. Becoming a buyer in training/buyer is virtually impossible unless you are the managers favorite. The general manager of this location is very rude and ignorant of what’s going on under his nose. Wouldn’t recommend.
bad,"the people you work with are great the management or styles of management  need a bit of work. They micro manage to the extreme, and do not set the right expectation about pay. Other dealers that have adopted this style of selling are paying more per deal. When your CEO makes about $20 million a year there is a huge divide."
bad,"Independently directed purchase teams in the procurement of vehicles at district levels."
bad,"What was expressed about growth and opportunity along with pay was HIGHLY exaggerated  "
bad,Everyone in management is out there own career and doesnt care about others that work at carmax. As a former employee I was very disappointed in the way tried to act like they cared but really didnt.Beware of this company when it comes to the bottom line they will treat you like nothing....
bad,"Micromanaging is a big thing occurs everyday makes it harder to get work done when every couple of seconds get interrupted by them. Very hard to move up because they wait years to promote leads. May move departments after convincing management to push paperwork. Must work outside/ inside regardless of weather pouring rain, snow, heat etc. Be ready to walk a lot good amount of exercise. Get pto for major holidays, day shift off Sundays night shift gets weekends  off."
bad,"Employees use bad language.The production line are backstabbers. The body work if horrible and they use the a low end paint, which is bad for the environment "
bad,"Changed pay structure due to opening up call center.Now make 35 to 40% less than before. Environment has become toxic"
bad,When you are paid by commission you expect to have enough work to make your hours and for weeks we would run out of work and that would effect the amount of money which you would bring home
bad,"On some days they have game event which I don't care about and cookouts. I have learned how to wash the car process, clean the interior,buffing process,and touch up mixing. the management is not what I expected to be. The work culture is ok not 100% but ok. The hardest part of the job detailing on whole car by myself on time. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting done."
bad,"I started out as an Early Collections Specialist and never got the chance to promote because I was ""lacking"" in my interview skills. Even when applying for an internal position you must undergo 2 interviews, and testing. Passing the tests with flying colors makes no difference if you are not good at interviews. I applied for 6 different positions within the CAF location and was denied each time with excuse after excuse.  The pay is excellent and benefits are awesome. The stress of being a collector is very high with unreachable goals. Monthly bonuses are almost unattainable. Management has no experience with the jobs they are supervising. Management lacks empathy, and do not care about you as a human being. Overall, if you do not want to promote and are a great collector, you could really benefit at this position. Paid time off (sick/vacation/personal), benefits and awesome employee events yearly (think prom for adults with adult beverages, casino games and lots of expensive prizes) and big quarterly meetings with food, games and prizes. Gift cards for holidays, and fun parties with potluck food and yes, more prizes. I would work here again, but in a different position."
bad,the management is a bully type if you do not agree with everything as he or she sees it you will be ran out the door ASAP. you will not be awarded for hard work and doing what is needed to get cars sold and you will not get anything you are told when you start there
bad,dont work here this is a bad place to work. They will fire you if you are sick. They have started to fire people because of age
bad,ye its a great place to work but don't count on a retirement plan. was just told they will not pay out vested dollars in a lump sum. has to be monthly when you reach min. age 62. screwed my plans for retirement
bad,A wonderful company to work for! Excellent training and opportunities. Thoroughly enjoyed my time there. A great place to hone in skills in the automobile industry.
bad,"They limit your work load and pay according to their report numbers, sonif their nubers are high they cut your work and pay. if you punch in a minute late you will be written up. Managers only care about their production numbers. If they are too high they basically cut you work and pay.."
bad,"As a very high achieving employee, who’s been with Carmax for two years… The new CEC and the new direction of Carmax is all about shareholders and profits… And has nothing to do with customers or employees."
bad,Never work there again they don't do write ups or correctives for one little mistake. And I have a family to support especially my 3week old daughter and just like that they want to fire me.
bad,"HORRIBLE COMPANY TO WORK FOR! Quality of cars are horrible, I’ve seen first hand customers being sold vehicles that could’ve killed them, no a/c, physically breaking down and having to be towed back mins after purchase. If you care about people and your customers don’t work for a company that endangers their lives."
bad,"If you like working 10-12 hour days coming in on days off & getting a paultry commission then you’ll love this job. Micro-managed to the max. Managers care only about hitting store numbers for their bonuses at the salesforce expense. Managers look for what you don’t do & you hear about it but don’t support the successes. 100% commission & very inconsistent. They claim to pay an hourly but if you don’t hit a minimum $$ commission it in reality turns into a draw that you are docked for on the next paycheck. Turnover is huge! They over hire anticipating turnover & dilute your opportunity to have viable customers. Mandatory to be manning phones up to 12 hours a week, even if you have customers coming in  to purchase a car, you either have to split the sale, give it up for a future trade or attempt to have someone else cover your phone time. There’s no volume bonus or incentive. Straight $160 per car sold. Guess how many cars you need to sell to earn a comfortable living? Mandatory to take lunch before the 6 hour mark or write ups occur. No flexibility with your schedule at all. Mandatory 45 hour schedule (5 hours a week for lunch)"
bad,"Poor teamwork, you are expendable from day one and you never get fully trained. The company is great to buy a vehicle from but horrible to work for. You never have time to yourself and no one really cares about anything that may be happening with you, it's all about making money for the company"
bad,There isn't much to talk about they move you if you want management. I left because they wanted me to move to another state for a management promotion with out any compensation for doing so. I would have to have had to have paid 100% of the cost of moving. Not the greatest incentive to move.
bad,"Terribly managed location , very low morale ;  hours are many and income does not match your hard work ; 10-12 hour days with no pay at times; cars are delivered dirty and no one does anything about it ; business office is highly dysfunctional.  Clock-punch system strictly enforced , but very little respect in turn for sales consultants.   Must buy your own uniforms , AND use your personal cellcell phones!  No reimbursement "
bad,Voice and opinion is never heard even when you have more experience in the field than the person managing you it is ran like a corporation rather than a real shop when quality is over shadowed by cost.and your never paid for your experience feels more like your being robbed at knife point
bad,"this work place is a very fun and out going work envirement to work for, many snack machines, ping pong tables and alot of fun things to do during the work day.  solving customer car loan problems"
bad,I worked in inventory. Dead end job with dead end managers.Only thing l liked about the job were some of my coworkers. Although they were lazy and disrespectful.
bad,"Colleagues would never be on time, never do their share of the work, supervisors wouldnt care or cohert with lazy coworkers. Pay was extremely low and managers were not very empathetic."
bad,At first I was excited to start at Carmax. But after getting used to the way Carmax “builds” their used vehicles I soon learned this place was not what I expected. Low labor pay rates per job and constant disagreement with techs about vehicle needs.
bad,"Carmax is a used car dealer. They pride themselves on being low pressure and transparent with the customers. However, the Sales Managers micromanage everything the Sales Consultants do. They can also be vindictive, immature, and they play the favorites game. Some of your coworkers will be really nice people who you can develop friendships with. However, many of them will also be snakes and try to steal sales and make you split money with them. Carmax is commission based, to a degree. You get a decent hourly wage and then you get a set amount per car. Theres no percentage for the price of the car like a normal dealership. Also, you don't get both your hourly and your commission. If your hourly is higher than your commission would be in a pay period, you get your hourly, and vice versa. This makes it hard to be motivated to sell cars when there is one or two days left in the pay period and you haven't sold any. Another problem with this job is the lack of separation between work and personal life. Every day your managers and coworkers will be texting you and calling you about appointments they need you to take or appointments you have set in the system for your day off. However, a customer can go in and set an appointment on your day off without even clearing it with you first. So, if you have an appointment set for you day off, and you don't find somebody to cover it or come in on your day off to help that person, the managers will be badgering you about it on your day off. If you wish to do well in this job, you have to know sales well. If you're not sales oriented and if you"
bad,A typical day at carmax consists of a lot of repetition of cheesy scripts that do not work in real life situations. The management requires that you use these scripts when talking with customers and in turn it aggravates people and causes the sales consultants to lose out on sales.  When you do make a sale the pay is little. The sales consultants have to put in long ours to try and make up for the time that is wasted by carmax. They offer little money for peoples cars and then leave it on the shoulders on the consultant to break the news to the customer. Depending on your environment your co-workers will step in on deals and take money from you. Management does nothing to prevent situations like that from happening in the future.
bad,If you plan on moving up in this company you wont ever do so as a detailer or mechanic.  You have to work superfast in order to make enough to pay your bills.  With speed comes s**t work.  And all they do is talk about quality...
bad,Management is extremely unprofessional and don't care for employees.
bad,"Working for Carmax has been so stressful  I loved the work, but the pay is ridiculous. Every single person there has a second job, including some management because they DO NOT PAY ENOUGH. Every other company is paying $15+ an hour for half the work, and Carmax refuses. The management is insane, discriminatory, underpaying and just plain selfish. I would 10/10 recommend this job if you hate yourself and don’t like money"
bad,"On the sales floor you work really hard to make money because strictly commission based and they just changed the pay structure, took half the money. Did the same in the CEC and said it was bonus now instead of commission. You never know what you are going to make until after your paycheck is issued."
bad,"Weak need not apply you will have to deal with strong personality types both with customers and employees. "
bad,"Management has no clue except 1 and that's the operations manager. The business office lead knows and does his job well and 2 of the 4 inventory leads do their jobs well. One lead thinks hes a manager and the other lead has no idea about what she is suppose to be doing."
bad,Decent benefits for a car sales position.  Have to work nights and weekends especially difficult to manage with a family and different activities that involves. Advancement oportunities if you're willing to change departments and locations.
bad,"Carmax was a good place work if you don't need money. I was there 8 years as a salesperson recieved 4 pay cuts which is hard to stomach because the company has been making record profit year over years. Don't expect to share in any of the company success. Carmax does not pay bonuses or have profit sharing, the holiday bonus is a $15 Turkey coupon that didn't  work"
bad,An awesome training program but the life balanace and work balance is way off. I would not recommend this company to anyone thou. If a customer has a complaint about you it does not matter what you do or say there is no fighting it.
bad,Company has gone way down hill. It’s all about making budget. Pay is awful in the business office and there is no room for advancement. Not to mention the horrible hours and rude customers...avoid this job. It’s not worth it. You won’t be able to afford to live on this job alone and having a second job is impossible with this schedule. Turn over is high for a reason but management refuses to recognize this. Managem act like sheep when corporate comes around and we all pretend that the company doesn’t suck for its employees. Truly disappointing to see how things have changed.  Company will continue to down hill until employees are recognized for their value. Pay what we are worth and support us as employees!
bad,"Carmax was focused more on the numbers and statistics than their employees, which is why I quit. I left Carmax to advance with a different company that saw me as a human and not just a number."
bad,Worst managers I have ever worked for.  Constantly called in on days off.  Management only cares about themselves and their advancement.  Sell a $60K car and only get $150.
bad,"Hardest part of the job is to start with 4 to 5 weeks of video training that becomes very long and boring-pay during training/$12 per hour. After that pay is commission only-can range from $10 per hour up to $30 per hour-average pay $15 to 20 per hour. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and finding the right car for them. The culture and management are very hands off and disinterested/disengaged-unless you do something they don't agree with, then they are up in your grill about it."
bad,"over worked and poor management low pay. Extra work added and pay stays the same. Some management cares only about the job getting done, not caring on how much work is done by employees"
bad,"Senior Management only cares about themselves. They're willing to let someone go who's a ""functional expert"" because of childish and immature reasons. They make it seem like the best place to work when in fact its been the worst job I've ever had and the worst manager I've ever experienced. You are worked to death, absolutely no work/life balance, and the expectations are too high. They expect people to never make mistakes and when they do happen, they throw the rule book at you. They LOVE to tear you down and place blame elsewhere, rather than take any kind of responsibility. You have to be a massive ""suck-up"" to be successful and stay employed"
bad,"The inter-office politics are very bad and if you do not play along, you move in the company or you leave. Management will not help you unless you make them."
bad,"I started with this company leaving one of their main competitive organizations with high hopes and sold on their growth, development, work/life balance, as well as stability. Come to fund out, none of what they sold to me came true, even down to the standards that a glorified ""buy here pay here"" company offers their customer. If you preach, you best practice it. Definitely the worst company I've ever worked for. Controlling, manipulative, and liar's is a a few word's just to start. They even have you take classes on integrity, honesty, stability, quality, and work/life balance and do absolutely none of it once you're in the door. If you have no standards, education, or trade this is definitely the place for you. But when you disagree on turning the cheek, like i, I was told it's not Timmax. The pay is decent if you can be bought. I have standards I live by as a technician and there's don't equal what I left for them on any level, period. They are a hoax for and promote people that park cars to management to tell techs how to work on cars, them managers hawk eye and pick out everything you do wrong though they couldn't do it themselves and leave you and your degree as a joke. Hint: Start off parking cars with no education, trade, or experience and you'll have a career. Corporate shoot's themselves, makes management dig out the bullet, and demand for an answer on why they were shot. I had a personal meeting with the GM on why I was resigning and wanted to switch department's, i was told I'd get a call in regards to our conversation. I got a FedEx letter from them days later."
bad,"I applied for a job in the business office, however, they offered me a job in sales and I accepted the job. You are under a great deal of pressure to perform at a certain level. Very stressful environment."
bad,"I'm pretty sure every job gets grief for something but never have i ever had a job with several departments and only use one department as its whipping boy. For anyone applying for this company, DO NOT get roped into being an inventory associate."
bad,"•	Build and sustain customer focused store culture to facilitate a pleasant shopping experience."
bad,"I'm sure everyone has a different experience, but mine was/is terrible. At first it was nice, the company throwing parties, giving out free stuff, bonuses, etc. But then, bs started happening. Management is the definition of micromanagers, corporate wants them to meet a certain quota, and if they do, they get a huge bonus. So, to cut costs when ""sales are low"", production associates get hammered with hours getting cut. Some of us have bills to pay! Anyway, you have these pointless meetings and watch stupid corporate videos at these meetings which cut into your numbers which you have to hit no matter what, even if it affects quality. This company is a cult, telling you how you should act, and even how they talk sounds cultish. This job is a joke, if you're going to work here, make sure you make friends with management, because they play favorites. If you want to move up, make sure you don't complain, or you will be stuck at your current position. If management doesn't like you for whatever reason, watch out, you will get looked over constantly. This company is all smoke and mirrors. Nothing they say is true all the time. Stay away from this company, not many of you know this, but Circuit City helped start this company, and some of their failed business leaders now lead this company. We all saw how good Circuit City did."
bad,A lot of hours and way to many sales people. Most folks that work their hate it. If you will notice they are always hiring.
bad,"company restructures, I did learn a lot about myself and capabilities."
bad,Very disorganized and managment is terrible. Working enviroment is not bad but some things are very unprofesional to say the least. Very little care is given to the emplyee.
bad,This company cares more about the business aspect rather than their employees. Management is not helpful AT ALL. You voice your concerns and possibly get fired. Or written up. You ask questions and they don't even know the answers. You'll get 3 different answers from THREE managers. No communication at all. The pay is absolutely ridiculous for what they expect from
bad,"Little to no communication with management. Management legit plays favorites and LGM lies to your face to get you out of his office. Payscale is broken and none of the higher ups know how it works. Other CeC associates in other stores will steal your leads and you will be told to just work harder. Over half of the office could not make rent and management just fired people for voicing concerns  or were told ""there are other opportunities  other than CarMax."""
bad,"Car business run by not so good car people. Basics are getting neglected like providing quality cars for customers. Corporate management often come from other retail industry and may not even like cars."
bad,I worked for them for 5 years. The first 3-3 1/2 years I really enjoyed it. They have changed a lot of their ways. They used to be very employee focused and it was like working with family. Now things are a lot different. It is still an okayish place to work. They have a lot of great benefits and pay is decent when you have been there awhile. It's a lot of hard work and there is no work/life balance. You work a lot. Biggest downfall is the direction they are headed with the how they treat associates. They do not give you time or the communication you need to either correct mistakes or move forward. I would recommend to work for them short term but not long term.
bad,"CarMax is not an ideal job. It’s strictly commission so you are always on the customers time. If you want to make decent money, expect to not have off days or work open to close to get a sale. A lot of cliques so other consultants will work deals with certain people and that’s it. Micromanaging is ridiculous so don’t even bother putting an appointment in the system and listen to every call! The only only positives are a few of the people I have met. Not a long term option at all."
bad,Don’t have much to say about carmax honestly. Sales managers didn’t really do much to help. All they did was check paperwork didn’t help with customer problems
bad,I would say that my overall experience at CarMax was something i would recommend for another. The sales goals and coaching are not realistic according to the demographics of the area
bad,"CarMax tries to convince people its a laidback place to work and to a point it is, but difficult sales goals make the job difficult. You not only have to meet car sales goals but you also have to meet maxcare sales goals. The mentoring focuses more on what you do wrong and gives little credit to what you do right. The training is good but the way sales is structured most people are fired or demoted to car prep positions within a few months to avoid getting fired. I had high hopes for this company and loved working sales but I wont ever work for CarMax again."
bad,"Management will pick out a few associates that they do not like and will constantly harass you into multiple meetings per day. They will take your time away from actually selling cars to have two managers or more have meetings with you in the same day. They will do this to try to pressure people into quitting or they will try to find technicalities to get you fired if they do not like you. If you are not a CarMax robot, you will be targeted. If you like meetings and have no interest in selling cars, CarMax is great."
bad,"most of the time one manager would say one thing and that will change. Takes a long time to get approval for a job which you don't get paid for while you stand around. "
bad,"i have worked for Carmax for 14 years. The current management style is difficult to deal with. labor lines are continually getting cut, work load is light. informational is not always accurate. on the one hand they tell you you are appreciated and on the other the make your job more difficult than it needs to be and when asked for the reason as to why they give a runaround answer and move on."
bad,Your true value is to continue to vote carmax into the top 100 companies to work for. There is a lot of turnover in this organization. You can learn a lot to take with you into a more professional sales career.
bad,"CarMax was a fun place to work, earning potential was high. Associates were always fun to be around. But ""Big Box"" stores are subject to change at the drop of a hat. That is all I can say."
bad,"very unstable and stressful environment. management was not fully qualified to assist in every matter, lots of talking about employees behind their backs and management favouritism"
bad,"Carmax was a stressful place to work, they constantly micromanage which takes away from the overall work experience as well as your ability to do your job."
bad,Management demands high numbers and no training to show for it  days in and out with overtime but commissions where low to be expected from a used dealer
bad,"The head manager was rude, and not nice to the woman. Poor pay. very cut throat. co-workers where great, team lead managers helpful. Would not recommend job if you do not like pushing people into the vehicle to earn your pay."
bad,The company has lost touch with the senior team. Views us as a number and not as individuals anymore. They expect you to drink the corporate Kool-Aid daily.
bad,Very hands on work place. Attention to detail is a must for this job. Advancement is very political and not fair. In order to get promoted you have to move and work out of state.
bad,"When I first began my employment here I truly believed that this was the place to be.  I felt welcomed and quickly felt that this was a great opportunity.  After about 5 months I have discovered that the culture here is all a mask that covers the face of bad management.  Some sales consultants are allowed to do take advantage of other consultants without any consequences.  Also there is a lot of favoritism towards some consultants as well.  Now do not get me wrong there are some good people that work here.  Its frustrating to do so much work to sell a car and have little to no support from management.  Several managers have left the company due to inconsistent practices from other managers.  As a sales consultant you will find that you do a lot of work only to be diminished by some  people that work in the business office and in the service department.    I have learned that this place could be a great place to earn a living, but can be very frustrating due to the lack of management consistency.  Each manager is different and you will typically get a different answer depending on who you ask.  You will quickly learn to only go to certain managers with certain questions."
bad,"I worked a tremendous amount of time and became a trainer in which there was no compensation for. It was based on the success with in 80 hours of the trainee working. Often they would reach goal, but you only received $400. Compared to the amount of hours you put into training someone, and at times two at a time. Not worth it. You also can't move up in the company without being a mentor. And, it's dependent on if you can move most times."
bad,"If you are comfortable working in an environment with weak, poorly-trained managers and pre-scripted dialogue you have to repeat 20 times a day, you'll like Carmax. The benefits are good, paychecks are on time but the pay scale fluctuates at the whim of the corporate office.  Long hours, co-workers you can't trust and zero support from other departments within the company."
bad,"Work can be very stressful, with managers breathing down your throat and only giving you negative feedback. Carmax says its a great company to grow, but there our certain positions that they make it close to in possible for an employee to get the job; they rather hire from the outside."
bad,"Not impressed. worked for them for almost 3 years and because i still do, all I will say is that I genuinely am NOT impressed. Fortune 100 best places to work? Solely on paper."
bad,"A workday would typically start with checking on CCM to see if there is any customers to follow up with before hitting the UPs list. "
bad,"Started working at this company 2 years ago. Was told that there was room for advancement however I find that to be untrue. They basically only allow people that they like to advance. Your direct supervisor has to much say as to how your career advancement goes. You will interview and do great but they will give you feedback every time telling you about different competencies that you need to work on. Once you work on those competencies the next time you post for another position they will give you a new set of competencies to work on. I have been trying to move to another position for a year now with no success.There are people that have been working for the company for over 6-13 yrs are are stuck in the same roles, their pay has been capped out simply because there really isn't any room for advancement. The pay is low and I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here unless you were desperate."
bad,"The LGM at this location is a bully, doesn't like people who actually work and is head of the good ole boys club.  It's commission based but there is an hourly schedule - they like to do that to make sure you show up but don't ask for a break it's frowned upon.  Working with customers and most of the co-workers was great, it's the management that makes the environment unbearable."
bad,Classic American corporation where as an employee you don't feel appreciated.
bad,Since the company is not growing at an expected rate many employees didnt get promoted and are still stock at the same place. Management has a culture of passing on blame to others so they can keeo their jobs. Not as fun as many would think
bad,Managers don't help their employees succeed at their position. Employees opinions don't matter.  No room to move up unless you move across the country.  They don't care about work life balance.
bad,Working for CarMax started out as a very unique and progressive company. After my 6th year at Carmax (work there for over 10 years) we started to see the shift from compensating employees to over compensating shareholders. Its best to approach this job as temporary one. Started out making $36 - $40k as a part-time worker. Ended up making less than $36K as a full-time employee (because the company decided to increase profit margins by overloading the sales floor with too many commission based sales consultants. The culture is ripe with nepotism. Your hard work will not be appreciated. There is NO way that I would recommend anyone work there now.
bad,"Management goes through the motions and do not live up to the mission statement for their company.  They have constant training, but again, its just jumping through the hoops because the company demands this training.  The company seems to be stuck in the 1990's for policies and procedures that other companies have abandoned a long time ago.  They were, at one time, innovators that have slipped back as competition not only met them, but passed them by.  Hopefully, one day, they will see this and change their ways."
bad,The new sales commission is bad for the sales associates OMNI CHANNEL cuts out need for sales associates and allows customer to deal direct with the call centers
bad,It's a ok company for a little while. Till you find out your going no where unless the lpm like you. From what you start until at the top it's not much of a raise. The MGMT micro manages way to much they literally treat you like kids.
bad,Carmax was a good place to work at. I enjoyed the team I was working with but the management was just okay. I would recommend this job to someone new in the industry.
bad,when started  standards were high its gotten to where they seem to hire mangers friends that no nothing about automotive industry. Managers are making unrealistic promises to customers being they don't know what the job entails for repair
bad,You are not gonna make money there. You soend more time chasing money that making money. They only interested in helping the top consultants who they give easy sales to if you’re in the middle or bottom you’re SOL.
bad,"You can’t move any further unless you are a favorite. The managment picks favorites, gives them prime schedules and doesn’t care about the rest. You get punished for having kids.  they focus on your faults. I thought this was going to be a great career but I was wrong."
bad,"Keep in mind I was not happy at CM, so this is a one sided review. Management was not supportive, it was a good old boy's club when I was there. Promotions where not conducted railrly."
bad,"The work environment would have been much better if it didn't cater to only young adult. giving that the manager was much younger she was on the same page as the staff . Very smart , but her strategy for training was not great at all for other age group . not a lot of respect ."
bad,"varied retail schedule doesn't allow proper work life balance. hours sucked. rigid corporate structure. good training program for buyers, but they are being phased out"
bad,To work for a place like Carmax is truly a great job. However they do not follow their own culture of integrity they claim to have. They do not fully support their sales team. Sales is always worrying about their job security.
bad,"I was an ASE master Tech with over 35 years in the field. they started getting very cheap managers from places like Lowes, Starbucks and other places that don't know anything about working on cars. they would rather write you up and find something to get you in trouble so they think they are doing a good job."
bad,working here will make you happy at first until the management gets a chance to rule your life with rules. the communication is terrible and overall running of the place is insane. a lot of chiefs.
bad,"Probably the most poorly managed company I've ever worked for. As an older employee, I grew up with a work ethic in no way matches this company's managment directive."
bad,The pay was not near what it should be for the amount of work. You have to make over a certain amount or you go negative and have to pay back your negative to make money. Management was lazy and did not help with closing deals.
bad,"I enjoyed the people. The hours just did not fit a family life balance. Otherwise, it was okay. It depends on your manager if it is a good job or not."
bad,"Managers were more concerned with appeasing corporate than taking care of customer needs. Wasted time of associates time by unnecessary repetitive unpaid yet mandatory training, regardless of tenure and rank."
bad,"Didn’t take care of their production people, ignored issues and complaints dealing with inappropriate work behavior and harassment amongst employees. No work/life balance. Upper management only focuses on constantly increasing numbers and hastening procedures rather than assuring quality and control. The pace of work became increasingly rushed to where the workers felt they were forced to overlook certain aspects of their work and focus only on getting to as much as they could within the time limit rather than assuring quality production of new or transferred vehicles."
bad,"They hire inexperienced and promise that they can make good money, however reality is that they won't make much money at all. 160.00 a sale and average two sales a week. It's fun to work there if you don't need to make much money."
bad,"If you are looking for a position to push you in every way a BOA is the right fit for you. You are constantly doing something and for the most part multi-tasking throughout your entire shift. You are taking in payments, processing paperwork, answering phone calls and greeting/working with customers. Every week the schedule changed and depending on how many associates the most hours worked as part-time was 36 hours a week. There was multiple times that schedules would overlap so you would work 8-9 days straight. Training happened within the span of 6 months. However, most of the training you learn after the fact of actually applying it throughout the work day. Training has the opportunity to be grand but lacked in execution. Based on all this you will find some associates that make it worth the stay. Anyone who has worked as a BOA has earned their paycheck."
bad,"Recent changes to the Culture and the operations have focused on reducing good paying jobs and replacing them with hourly workers."
bad,"You are only scheduled to work an 8 hour shift, say goodbye to weekends. Coming in on your day off is common, commission rate hasn't increased in 20+ years. Hard to provide for a family unless your in presidents club, and it's really easy to fall out of club level unless you keep crazy margins of units sold."
bad,"No proper training within roles. Associates are expected to learn as they go and when mistakes are made, they are still reprimanded. Under appreciated for the level of quality an associate puts forth to getting job completed and no understanding for what the job entails. Sacrifices in ones health by not taking necessary breaks to complete job tasks. ""Open door"" policy present but when approached to discuss possible issues, information is placed in month end reviews as a negative, for example "" not adapting or accepting of change"". When the purpose of the discussion was to inform the manager of pain points to get through the work day. Overall a very friendly enviornment amongst the peers. I have learned alot over the years such as systems and critical thinking strategies within the Business Field. However as the company has evolved, the mission and purpose of the company has over shadowed the employees who do the  work that helps the company run successfully on a daily basis."
bad,I work in the detail department where we focus on every detail to perfection. I wet sand buff and paint correction do a full interior detail and exterior detail. The only thing thing I can complain about is are Management
bad,"Very biased work environment"
bad,"I worked at Carmax for about a year, and I never truly enjoyed my time there. My manager did not understand how to relay instructions succinctly and clearly to the staff, and she/he did not get along well with most of us associates.  The work was boring and there was too much downtime between activities. I would say the most exciting about the job was the staff, as we all got along well and I still am friends with a few of them to this day."
bad,Pay very little but ask for a lot of work! You can never do anything right with them! Oh and always plan to get in trouble for something! Worst job I've had so far! Love my co workers management is just horrible!
bad,Not friendly workplace. Employees are treated badly there. Micro-management is rampant. Turn over rate really high here. You're expendable. Managers are a joke.
bad,No team work then when you had team work you had to hold there hand.If you didn't hold there hand they made a MISTAKE and you payed the price.
bad,"Quality and standards are lax when convenient for the company. Regular employee undermining from management will have you working harder for less. Management, overall, is a joke."
bad,"This company is very confusing. They claim to be about the employees and have a culture of communication and respect. I found this to be true - if you're a manager. Typically an average employee is better seen - working very had to appear busy even when it's a slow day, rather than heard. The company won't listen to any input that isn't from upper/senior management and treats you like another cog in the used-car profit making machine. Which is fine except they act like this job is a blessing and will make you rich and successful if you just put your heart and soul into it. I've seen people do just that, which just earns them extra stress, MAYBE a pat on the back, but definitely no pay raise."
bad,I have gain a lot of skills working at CARMAX but the ability to advance was not as internal as they have stated.
bad,Management is incompotent.
bad,I enjoyed working with my coworkers and work was fine when I was initially hired on but our general manager hates our department and is always breathing down our necks and blaming us for things we didn't do.
bad,When I fist started my employment at CarMax it was a great place to work. As time had moved on it cultural had begun to change and you really needed to watch your back.
bad,The pay is way too low for what they ask of associates in the business office. They get paid the least for the most work completed and get no respect.
bad,You will learn a lot without the proper training. It’s a sink or swim learning environment. Management takes no accountability and will allow you as the novice to deal with irate customers that they don’t want to help. I work here out of desperation. It’s a hard task in finding a new job and I have been looking for another since day 1 at Carmax.
bad,Sometimes is fun but you have to do jobs that you're not being paid for. You have to go in the sun and merchandise. Inventory is in its own world and never do their job well. The cars always come out of prep still dirty. The consultants have to clean their own cars sometimes after they prep them. Managers are just miscellaneous
bad,"A typical day at Carmax is the Sales Manager yelling at your ear constantly, pulling you aside on the floor to tell you how your numbers needs to be improved. The management makes it very difficult for the Sales Consultants to survive and progress. An extremely micromanaged company where there are so many Bosses at every lair and they tend to keep people constantly under pressure. I have worked for Carmax for more than 6 years, 1 out of 20 may actually last in this company. You'll actually spend lot more time with your managers for meetings, huddles, development plan etc. than being on the floor and earning. Would not recommend to anyone  because Carmax one of the least paying company in car business. They really have no way or intention to protect their employees but the system is designed to cover their own rear end and protect their own interest. Managers are robots and just reads the book out to you in most of the cases."
bad,Buyer’s Assistant Pay fluctuates between employees but overall average is $13. Good pay if the work matched. We are over worked throughout our planned day and then asked/made to take on more work while Buyer’s/Managers sit inside at desks with the excuse of them “not being able to leave the desk”. In some cases 1 or 2 won’t be able to but the rest use it as an excuse to not do anything yet get paid more. BA’s are outside 92% of the time and are pressured to also do the jobs of other positions while still maintains the same alps least pay in the department.
bad,"Paid low for the amount of work they expect of you. I was an appraiser which means being out in the elements rain,snow or ball blistering heat. They dont expect you to sit down for more than a few seconds at a time even if it is a slow day."
bad,"Carmax will boast about their culture and treating everyone with respect. That only applies if you are a manger, if you are lower your voice does not matter to them. They will pay for their managers to fly all over the states and move their families, but if they forget to pay a lower employee they wont make it right. What they will do is pass around a collection plate for other employees to make up the difference. If you bring any problems to management they will never try to resolve the problem. What they will do however is ask you what you can do to resolve the problem yourself. Then tell you why your problem is your own fault.  Now getting to the cars that are sold, the amount of hazardous problems that come out of production stores is laughable and will be masked by them telling customers either meets standards or have someone glue it back together for it to fail at a later time after the warranty is up. Cars with extreme amounts of rust are passed as long as you cant punch a hole through it.. Take any car you want to buy to another shop and they will find many issues. Overall its not a healthy environment for someone who has more then two brain cells and values their own dignity."
bad,"Not the company it was before. Changes at the top have inevitably had a trickle down effect. Used to be an amazing place to work that stood above the rest. Now its still a good place to work, but it falls in line with the rest of the corporate world."
bad,"The inventory dept is so unorganized they lose (allegedly) cars when transport drivers come to pick them up. Which is because managers are suppose to sign off on cars but dont then it doesnt get correctly accounted for in the computer system showing cars gone when their not or not showing them when their still there...Somewhere on the lot."
bad,"Carmax had some wonderful management.  There were also terrible members of management who would promote based on ""favorites"" not really who has more training or skills."
bad,"I only worked in one location for several years, which is the Davie store location. Store manager isn't looking to advance from within the store. The managers there talk down to you when you ask for help, like as if you don't know anything. The managers don't seem to look for ways to close the deal. I have never met managers that didn't want to close deals before, it's crazy. Half the time they don't know what to do there selves. To make money you have to work full time. Part timers could probably make pocket money, but thats any dealership. However, I've seen full timers makes as much as a part timer because they aren't producing. Majority of the clientele are appraisals, but, they say, for every 10 customers you see you should be selling 1 car. Everyone was complaining about the pay. For every car you sell that's 160 if you make presidents club it will be 180 (but that takes a few years since you have to sell above 600 cars to make presidents club). For every Maxcare you sell it's $100 and you get spiffs depending on the month and what they expect. And if you sell Gap it's 25$. So potentially you can make $285 per car if you sell all of the products with it. They want you to sell more than 10 cars a month (full time) but if you only saw 60 customers, you need to have sold 6 cars for the month. They should pay hourly for the amount of appraisals that walk through the door. Overall, you are not just the sales consultant, you are also the finance consultant. You will be running the application and checking to see what the customer is approved for. Non-negotiable company. The"
bad,"Although one may put much more work than other consultants into actually selling one of CarMax's marginally clean or semi-functioning autos, commission may be split with another consultant due to engagement via phone, test drive, etc. at other locations.  Your electronic office shifts are often served as secretaries for your peers instead of quality lead generation.  You are constantly marketing CarMax but borrowing minimum wage if your sales are in a slump.  Does Six Flags dock a team member's pay if she or she doesn't sell enough soda or snacks?  Merchandising autos takes up quite a bit of a sales consultant's time also, but he/she is compensated by a ""good job"" or ""you have to finish before you leave.""   Test drives and appraisals should count as marketing expense, and the consultants should be compensated accordingly whether or not an auto is purchased or sold.  How much longer will CarMax be allowed to work people and not compensate them properly?  Although a shopper may not purchase or sell this time, they may refer a friend or consider CarMax in the future due to how well one marketed the company and services that day.  Until then, tipping should be encouraged at any marketing engagement."
bad,Company does not help in the development and the turnover is not looked at as something to work on. Development is lacking and they do not look to help you if they feel you are not carmax material.
bad,"CarMax is an unstable, low-pay place to work.  The management staff is, mostly, very nice, but the overall work environment is more about policies than people.   Associates are under paid for the industry and overworked.  For example, for three to four months of training required in one department, the pay is the same at Wax-Mart across the street.  Violations for policies lead to immediate firing, as evidenced by the several people that have been asked to turn in their keys and badges randomly one day (probably about one person every other month), for small or negligible offenses.  The company works hard to satisfy it's customers though, just not it's associates.  If you're thinking of applying, it's better to stay on the customer side of the register."
bad,Management in our store does little to assist the Sales Consultant.  We sign observations and IDP's that have no impact on sales.  We need better leadership
bad,"It's not a very good corporate culture, the whole ""family"" theme is rather forced. Just felt very fake there, all the time, interactions between departments were click-y."
bad,No opportunity for growth. Pay is totally inadequate for the amount of work and ever growing list of responsibilities. Uniforms are not provided but required.The turnover is incredibly bad which leads to consistent lack of staff. The hours are not conducive to family life. Some locations stay open on Sundays. I cannot recommend Carmax to anyone looking for full time employment.
bad,I don't recommend Carmax as a place to work. Management is not professional and take advantage of the employees. Hours are horrible and you don't have a set schedule.
bad,"This job is great if you're passionate about cars and sales. I am not super passionate about either. I will say that I think as far as car lots go, this one probably has the most integrity. But...is that really saying much??"
bad,"management does not understand whats is necassary to do the job requirements, has people in charge that have no knowledge of what's is required  to complete a job properly."
bad,"I was here temporarily, but my reasons for leaving were 100% management. I did not feel that my manager was providing the necessary support that we needed to succeed and he had a bad attitude. There are people there who love to work and feel this is the best job that they have ever had. Overall, the company tries to reward well performing associates, I was just stuck with a bad apple."
bad,"Great place to work! Collborative atmosphere, great pay, free roam, interactive with people. Just get up and you will make the money. Great motivtional incentives. Reach presidents club!"
bad,"Staffed for the couple of busy days so you are not making money for a lot of your scheduled hours.  Required to attend training but not paid for it. "
bad,"A great place to work if you want to have no days off or work/life balance. To make a living, it is necessary to work open to close every day. No product knowledge of the vehicles you are selling. Hourly compensation is very low. "
bad,"Tuition Reimbursement offered, low pay, inadequate management. Low raises money spent on management salaries, outings, meetings, and food. Hours are pretty good"
bad,"Very difficult to make money, most customers had poor credit and could not close the deal. Very low commission, about $165 per car unless you push Maxcare which is expensive. Most salespeople would sell 5 cars a week but sometimes less."
bad,"great place to learn awesome customer service skills, great people to work with. I wish there was better training and better choice of hours. The mid shifts really left no room to actually do anything else during the day"
bad,"Strong Company, but not a good long term choice for those with `ambition, more a better role for someone who doesn't enjoy creativity or thinking in the workplace."
bad,"Pay needs to be better, much better for what you are asked to do."
bad,"It has become a Culture of lies, intimidation and abuse. The only reason more people dont leave is because of the economy. They have fully taken advantage of the unemployment situation. It has turned into a slave factory no matter how much money the company makes they continue to make cuts. they are getting fat while the working class that run these places starve."
bad,sale cars meet numbers meet all of customers needs answer call and customer question
bad,"Carmax has great values that corporate would like to incorporate. At my location those values are disregarded and the company has no room for advancement from within and favoritism in every department. You have to put on a show and be 'liked' as a friend to go anywhere. They also hire from outside the company for management opportunities and expect them to be trained by the people they are in charge of. Like my review summary, Carmax is a great first/college job. Nothing to stay at for long term unless you get hired into the position from outside the company."
bad,CarMax is a great place to work if only he management was better. i am a firm believer of acting as you preach. Don't tell me my do's and don'ts when yourself as a higher ranking officer can not commit as you are telling your associates.
bad,"For sales consultants they have change many things on the last 2.5/yrs. "
bad,"Managers are know it all's. Managers know it is incredibly hard to get fired from Carmax and utilize this to demean, belittle and do as little work as humanly possible. If you don't use their verbiage they will not act or assist you. Company LARGELY caters to salespeople, while simultaneously treating every other department like trash."
bad,"Used to be an awesome company to work for that cared about their employees. No longer. The new executive management team values the opinion of Wall Street over anything else. Their best and brightest are either trying to hold on till the end (if close to retirement), or jumping ship en masse to get to a company that shares the same values and culture that Carmax used to emphasize."
bad,"They don’t care if you are a good worker, they’d rather you just blindingly follow leadership that doesn’t know what they are doing . They’d you kiss butt then be a good worker"
bad,Management does not keep your information confidential and management uses the funds that are for developing and training on themselves instead of investing funds into the employees.
bad,Ok place to work. Was told hard work will allow me to move up. Company ended up laying off a bunch of people nationwide. Now there is no room for advancement in my position. They said if i was willing to go to another store (longer commute &pay cut) in a new department I MAY have better opportunities.
bad,"The employees were rude to each other, and the pay is non-existent after training.  You only get paid if you sell a car, or buy a car, no matter how many hours you work."
bad,"As a tech be careful,  if you do too good,  the weak links will start watching you, anything you do if they don't like it they'll complain, also the service manager and one of the techs are highschool buddies so if either of them don't like you they'll find a way to get you in trouble,  this is in the Tinley park store only don't know about the other stores.  BE CAREFUL!"
bad,"There is not much I am willing to say at this point, since I still work here. So many negative things have been happening, but there is reason to believe that things will get better in the future. This remains to be seen though."
bad,"I worked as a Sales Consultant aprox 7 years with no increase in salary or COLA.  When addressing lack of pay raises management, the response is always ""Sell more cars""."
bad,"Lot was jammed-had to move 3 cars to take one test drive (cuts into time dramatically reducing opportunities to work the numbers)"
bad,We got a little bit of money besides commission but not much.  What I hated the most being an employee is the person could bring the car back and you lose the commission.  Plus you could get fired if you don't reach the commission.
bad,"As a part time business office associate, I've been working with the company since 2016. There have been many people who've been let go by upper management. The culture and customer service is probably my favorite part about working here. There is no communication within the Business Office area and overall, meetings and ""huddles"" are pointless because things just go back to the way they were. Management is highly unprofessional and there is absolutely no room for advancement although they do love to preach about that. Many employers were let go for small reasons, meanwhile management makes tons of errors and will show up late for work and play the time clock and nothings changes because they are management. They love passing down their work to associates and make them accountable, so they aren't liable if anyone asks for an update. They'll hire someone and want to automatically push them up to management due to favoritism without following company expectations, procedures and certain criteria. You could have a conversation with upper management about the way you feel and the things you've caught them doing and they'll automatically write you up a week after. CarMax is a joke. Working here is like I'm in a high school drama show. CarMax would be a great company to work for if there was more control within the management levels. Now, I'm sure not all of CarMax locations are like this, but this pushes away associates. Things need to change."
bad,"They recently reduced commissions and cut every sales associates income up to 30% and was very misleading about the new pay structure and its role out. "
bad,"My time at Carmax was not enjoyable. There was a distinct hierarchy between management and technical team members. There was also great disparity in pay rates among technicians of the same or similar titles. The job itself was a ""throw them to the wolves"" experience with very little aclimmation to the technical and social environment. While there is a good degree of autonomy, effectiveness in performing the job was limited."
bad,"In the location at which I worked:"
bad,"First off, I want to say that the work there is easy and you can learn some cool things. The management, however, is pretty bad. I can’t speak for other Carmax locations, but the Omaha store is micromanaged to a T. The managers are absolutely dead set on getting you in trouble for every single slip up. If they’re angry with you for any reason, they’ll act like children and give you the silent treatment. They are good at standing around, playing on their phones, and contributing absolutely nothing to the work place. Their big thing is saying that your opinion counts, but it doesn’t. If you decide to get a job there, just show up, complete your work to the best of your ability and go home."
bad,"Everything is micromanaged to the point of frustration. There are guidlines and workbooks for every little thing (including on how to turn on a car). Management will walk around or just stand in the corner watching you but when you ask if they can help or if you ask a question they'll walk away or differ to somebody else. They don't know how to do the job becuase they either came from a different department or are an outside hire. "
bad,If you have plans to support a family or wish to advance over time look elsewhere. Mangers are all about numbers and their bonuses. Work is up and down and not consent. They try to make it up by lunches but that's not enough. Work is hard and way underpaid. They come off as a great place to work but over time true colors will show. If you have responsibility look elsewhere.  This is a job for young people 18 to 23
bad,I did not like working here. My experience was due to a particular manager who had it out for me though. Im sure working here would have been a positive experience if it wern't for that particular person.
bad,U put in the years and work n with no issues just like that u get cut throat u cause of what another employee says instead of investigating the matter themselves n don't count on corporate for help they believe what management says with no investigation of they own to see if u were an employee with a record for not doing your job n they let all the real good managers and employees get away by firing them
bad,"The Carlsbad Carmax Location is a wonderful work culture. I found it to be the complete opposite at the Inglewood Location. If you like sales Carmax has a good compensation plan, but the location makes a huge difference in your experience."
bad,a typical day at work is making sure to take care of customer on the phone … the work place culture is very pleasant. I got to meet  a lot of new people with diffirent culture
bad,"this job does not pay well for the amount of time you spend here, no work life balance they expect you to always be available for work even on your days off, does not have flexible scheduling, management in their position out of luck they do not possess any management traits."
bad,"This company is just another deception for American society and a really untrusted place to think that you have a career, we are just slaves of the mediocre."
bad,"Carmax is a place that while it all sounds good on paper, at least the CT locations (although some of the new rollouts will affect all locations) lack any real decent management that are most certainly playing favorites. They have a point system in the shop that if someone close to you passes away, they tell you that you are fine to go but then add points on after all is said and done. They even do this if you are ill and have to take multiple days off (doctor's notes are NOT accepted as a valid reasoning). There are individuals exceeding the 6 point rule and management just ignore any correctives with them like you will see should you end up in the same position as a favorite. They ask for opinions to make things better around the shop and then immediately disregard them (although some of these ideas are brought up by them a year later and they take credit for the idea). There is an issue with getting job equipment that would make for an adequate work environment like a box truck for tires (so you don't have to attempt to scrunch into an E-250 to attempt to take 50+ tires at a time), months to get a back brace, equipment that won't break so readily, etc. Also some of the inspection times are cut (which shows) and it seems to be all about numbers and how fast you can do things. If you don't hit these numbers (which would be easier if you can get the cars in the shop, if they are even located in the areas which they are supposed to be in the first place), you get reprimanded up to and including termination. There are people at the very top outside of the shop that seem to want"
bad,"pretty much just inspecting brakes all day from start to finish, oil changes. there is a lot of favoritism in order to get promoted. i dont recommend this place"
bad,"overtime varies depending on the time of year,typical dealership environment,fast paced,spend more time with co workers then your family depending on the department you work in"
bad,"The work environment is very stressful. Management isn't good at all. Compensation and benefits are good. Job culture is decent on paper, company says the right things but doesn't carry them out. Very inconsistent."
bad,"Keep your head down, collect your paycheck, speak when spoken too, and don't expect a promotion anytime soon. If you can live with playing the excruciating corporate game, then go for it... And if you don't mind the perpetual meetings and huddles, you literally meet about the meeting that everyone planned to meet at but decided to huddle instead of having a meeting about the planned meeting time."
bad,"I have never worked for a sales department that does not have a sense of urgency.  Management are always talking about teamwork and being there for your customers until you need them to do the same.  The money is not worth the headache because you have to do your job, management, and the detail department's job as well.  The system that CarMax has displayed is for sales consultants to sale 10 cars a month.  Sounds like decent money, but it's not.  CarMax is over staffing the sales floor because they think if they have 40 sales consultants that it will equal 400 units, 60 sales consultant equal 600, 80 sales equal 800, and etc, etc.   I really can not say that my experience is all bad.  I have met some wonderful people since I have been there.  I think CarMax is a great place to work for people that are in school, people without sales experience, or people of retirement age."
bad,pay scale is way too low. constantly micro managed and no matter how hard you work its never quite good enough...............................
bad,"Company schedules you 9 hours per day, but in order to succeed, you need to work every hour of every day (closed Sundays). Commission is poor. $160 per car sold, $100 per extended warranty, $50 if someone sells you their car ($0 if it is a trade in). I sold 11 cars in October and didn't have a paycheck over $1000. Customer traffic is very low, except on Saturdays. Most days, you sit and wait 3-4 hours form your turn with a customer. Medical benefits are expensive, compared to other companies I have worked for. 100% commission job. Not suitable for someone who has a family to raise. Managers are mostly consumed in the numbers. Most customers have a hard time getting approved for a loan through CarMax's lending network."
bad,The Management Team is not engaged in their Team Managers growth and Development. Contributing to the low Morale among Leadership Team. Managers promote based on good old boy buddy system vs job knowledge and qualifications.
bad,If you are a seasoned sales person this is not the company for you.  They prefer a drone someone that can be programmed.  God for bid you do not stay on the path of following the process.  Micro management is their specialty.
bad,"The company fills your head with garbage and makes it sound easy. Its buy luck if you sell a car. Also the corporate office is terrible.  I called to change my address in July 2013. Which they didn't.  Then I called again in January 2014.  Which they showed no notes of my first attempt and would change it promptly.  I called back February 6, 2014. They had no notes on my account of an address change so my w-2 was still mail to my old address.  Now I have to wait till the 15th for a reprint which means I can't file till  I get them sometime around the 20th."
bad,"As a commision only associate, you are expected to work on your days off, give your personal cell phone number to your customers, and are discouraged from taking time off. As a vehicle is a major life purchase, it becomes stressful trying to get customers financed, and getting them to commit to a vehicle. The employees are overall friendly to work with, but friendships are superficial as everyone is out for themselves, creating a sometimes hostile work environment. Management is constantly being pressured to boost numbers and they in turn tend to micromanage. I have learned how to communicate and connect better with individuals and tailor my approach for each customer. I have also learned the importance of giving insightful feedback when a problem arises."
bad,"It's retail, so forget about a consistent schedule and having family time. The company has a fraternity-type culture, and if you're not in the ""in"" crowd, then it's a miserable existence. Managers pressure employees to take monthly and yearly surveys in support of a great workplace. Good initial training on how to purchase vehicle inventory, but opportunities for increased compensation and promotion are lacking. Turnover is a huge problem, in all departments."
bad,"Its a great place to start, in order to get experience in a wholesale environment. But limited opportunity to progress within the company. Limited pay, compared to industry average."
bad,It was a good place to work. Great benefits. They have alot of cars. Good employees to work with. The times arent the best but they work. You get to have breaks.
bad,But compensation for vehicles sold is way too low ...not worth the effort you would put in for the sale ..some co workers are shady and steal your sell
bad,when you first start at this place it seems so easy and pleasant your first week. But by the 2nd week they will half way teach you something then expect you to be an expert within your first month. I worked in 2 departments and the communication and accountability is bad they work together and your the weak link. We had someone calling HR everyweek. Only postive is the benefits
bad,"The interview process was painless and fairly quick, very informative information pertaining to the company.  The job itself wasn’t bad, lots to learn, some days busy and other days not so much-but steady.  The staff (if you will) was nice and helpful, couldn’t really say that for a couple of the management members-they made you feel like a number.  Overall not a bad company, just not great management."
bad,"CarMax, like most publicly traded auto service companies, fails to deliver quality auto repair because of the constant pressure to reduce costs.  The customer will never be put ahead of the stockholder."
bad,They hire managers from outside instead of hiring salesman who work hard and know the process to sell and buy cars. Micromanagement if you don’t sell enough cars. Managers get bonuses on daily car sales if they hit the quota from corporate and monthly bonuses as well. So they really micromanage your sales even though most customers waste your time and don’t buy. Hard job and pay sucks.
bad,"Carmax tends to pay more than the average automotive shop, but the factory atmosphere and strict minute-by-minute scheduling and monitoring leads to an egregious number of repetitive stress injuries. It does not help that Carmax often has forced overtime for months at a time, further decreasing the ability of the employees to recuperate after physically stressful jobs."
bad,"You have a consistent schedule and you know what is expected of you. Management can be a bit pushy and micro managing is normal. I would say that this a place where you want to gain experience, but then move on to something else when you feel ready."
bad,"Overall good work place, culture needs major improvements. Management is ok, need additional training to learn effective methods in motivating workers outside of fear tactics."
bad,"I absolutely love working for CarMax. I love what they stand for and visiting Home Office (Virginia) definitely made me realize that there is a serious disconnect between store location management and Headquarters. "
bad,"Fun place at first, overworked, underpaid, always understaffed. At first when I started at Carmax I enjoyed going to work. As you stay there longer they over work you."
bad,"During my first week on the job 4 people quit, should have taken this as a sign that the job was not worth it. Very fast paced work environment and long hours."
bad,"Worked at the location in irving, tx and management was horrible. Hr do not care what you tell them. The people there are great people to work with. I would not recommend this place to work"
bad,"Lots of down time during the week. Busy on the weekends with customers not actually purchasing vehicles just browsing. Going into work and not actually getting paid until you sell a vehicle, to only make $300 if you sell a full package. Must be on time even making commission. Carmax will feed you, but you will work on most holidays. Great part time or post retirement job. Mostly men in this industry. Huddles that are pointless and make you feel like your inadequate. Rearranging vehicles on the lot and not being paid to do so in the early mornings plus sweating before the store opens. The ups list is a joke sometimes depends on who is on the list. It can become competitive with how splits work."
bad,"The more you work the more they want you to work.  Leaving when you are scheduled is frowned upon.  Retail hours mean your schedule changes everyday and therefore you can't plan anything.  It is not uncommon to close leaving between 10 and 11 PM and turn around and be back by 7-8 AM.  "
bad,All the managers were hired from outside and oversee work they have no idea about. Almost all the employees are stuck in positions because of a 6 month probation that is used for punishment liberally.
bad,Micromanagement with a low team bonus salary that does equate to the hours/ cars that are sold at sticker with a 30-60% inflation price on the cars. Would not recommend.
bad,Not an ideal place  to work for competitive salaries or career advancement. The employees are what make the experience of working for Carmax worthwhile.
bad,"Long story short: "
bad,"Okay job if you don't mind management who have no leadership skills whatsoever. Coworkers were all wonderful and the actual position was great, but poor management made the job a nightmare"
bad,"The work environment wasn't fair. Didn't feel equal at work. "
bad,"Working at carmax you get use to seeing new faces and old ones leaving regularly, this is for management and employees. Management is unaware of the work life due to unknown duties. Management is biased towards certain departments. For the most part it is very easy to get along with co- workers. A typical day is spent out in the heat and returning to half attempted air conditioned buildings. Best part of the job is having a flexible schedule, and ease of requesting off."
bad,"If you are ready to dedicate your life to them and become a robot to their ways and a suck up to management and spend countless hours and days there (except Sundays, because they are closed) then you will fit right in...... but if not and you decide to work there anyway,  don't get too comfortable -THEY WILL FIND A WAY TO TERMINATE YOUR EMPLOYMENT (especially if you work in sales). "
bad,Everything we do these days is based around winning another Fortune 500 award. It used to be customer service and quality cars.
bad,"Hours were very ""Retail"". I worked weekends and nights and some nights I did not get out of work until after 10 pm which is very unusual for a car dealership. I found it very hard to balance my at home life with at work life and felt some of the job was dealing with very difficult customers and stubborn management."
bad,"Started out great but turned for the worse over time. "
bad,"i learned how to clean cars in many different ways, how to clean cars in a short time , management was easy going to talk to but never took your back on what u told them, co-workers was nice and very busy , typical day at carmax was doing 23-30 cars a day"
bad,Suitable job for college students and young adults just starting out in life. Good benefits and flexible schedule in line with retail. Not for older or mature individuals.
bad,almost impossible to close a lead from start to finish without splitting it with someone due to current systems in place with the company.  Most people will set apts then not follow up and after you close it say they talked to them first and get the split.
bad,"Recent changes in job responsibility and descriptions combined with layoffs have made the company much less enjoyable to work for. Is not the same company it used to be, the efficiency initiatives and changes that heavily diminish morale seem endless."
bad,"Don’t work there if she is there she loves to play favoritism. She’s not a nice person at all!!!!"
bad,"I was a staunch believer in the company until I saw them dessert me and other managers after years of support.  It became very clear that the company was getting rid of managers that have been around for longer periods of time and replacing them with younger and less experience.  I do believe that because of their size, the company will continue to experience success short term, but in the end, because of the culture shift, I strongly believe that the days of the CarMax being a great place to work and an industry disruptor are long gone."
bad,"CarMax is one of the best places to work in the auto industry. Things are changing, though. Due to substantial growth, some fairly significant restructuring is happening that is impacting middle management."
bad,"It  was a good place to work, only because of friendly co-workers and distance to home. Throughout my time there, i felt like the co-workers had no voice, and the department manager didn't want to reason with any requests we had. I felt like even if the back of the building was on fire, he could just say something like ""just go wash that car first then we will look into it""."
bad,"The flexible schedule is really nice but don't try to move up in this company. they will let you interview for the position even though they know they're not gonna let you move up. the managers are horrible at all locations. i have been to 3 different locations and they only look out for themselves and other senior managers. they don't know how to be managers and definitely need to be retrained, especially at the Costa mesa location."
bad,"It's hard to justify working at Carmax when the same pressures are put on you as you would have at a regular decent car dealership.  Carmax is obviously better than the scummy places, but at a regular large dealership, why not work there and get paid more?"
bad,"Team was awesome to work with each day.  Management was not properly trained and fair in decisions made regarding employees, compensation and job advancement"
bad,"Mangers do not know how to motivate or relate to subordinates. "
bad,"work days was fun other days was very stressful, dependiing on the management. Carmax at times, discriminates towards it's associates and nothing happens when you report the behavior to the managers."
bad,"No work life balance. Flakey coworkers and back stabbers just like any other car dealership except the pay is WAY WAY less. Do not work here unless you need a job asap to hold you over,"
bad,"I left a very good job because I was told how great the company was, the well structured training and work/life balance they guarantee! When I was hired as a Business office manager in training prior to starting I was told my training would be 12-18 months, on my first day I was told that the training is a 6 month! The well structured training they claimed to have consisted of me shadowing others who were so busy that I was just following them around. The manager who I thought I would be learning from was very knowledgeable , but was/ is a TERRIBLE trainer. Someone at CarMax must take notice having knowledge doesn't make a person a good trainer. Way to much time spent on what they're going to eat rather than supporting a new employee on how to do the job. The worst decision I've EVER made going there. If anyone is considering working at CarMax you better think twice because it's not at all what it's cracked up to be. Lousy!!!!"
bad,"I had a good time with this company thanks to friends and coworkers and the managers but the politics of the place were horrible. Bad experience, would not work there again."
bad,"A typical at work was to undo other peoples mistakes. I learned many new skills but the more they taught you to do the more they would expect you to do without any pay increase. I was basically doing management types of roles that wasn't in my job description. I didn't mind that until, you'd train a new person and they'd give the new person the new lead or management position. They a few months later I'd come to work and fix that new person mistakes."
bad,"ok environment, most of the sales associates were young and not professional. Not very team oriented environment. Carmax is a good company overall just really out dated training software and video."
bad,"Temp workers would be given little opportunity to learn different jobs or advance, usually being relegated to the more difficult jobs that would normally be better suited to long-term employees because nobody wanted to work them.  Work hours were often erratic, being asked to work different shifts between days at the last minute and being criticized if you weren't available.  Hours and work was much more reasonable if a full time worker, but from what I could tell employees had to start as a temp worker and work for approximately a year before you could be considered as a full-time employee."
bad,"When I first started Carmax in 2004 I was very impressed with how well the company was run and felt good about the company's value and integrity.  I thoroughly believed in the product and felt good about what I was doing.  In recent years, Carmax has changed the quality standards on the cars and is not better than any other used car lot, may be even worse in some cases.  It has become so corporate that their policies are getting in the way of selling cars and offering a quality product. Service after the sale is horrible and a lot of times it reflects on you.  You are at the mercy of people that get paid by the hour and do not care if you are losing money because of them and do not treat the customer with the same importance that you do.  As a Sales Associate, you are 100% commission but you are not the only person controlling your paycheck.  There will be times when you have to either lose half a deal or come in on your day off because someone else didn't do their job correctly.  I was also at a store where the women are treated like second class citizens and not looked at as leaders, which goes against Carmax's culture.  If a woman speaks up or acts as an equal, they are looked at as if they are doing something wrong.  I was constantly harassed by a sales manager there for 6-7 years because his idea of ""respect"" is to cower to him.  He was constantly trying to get me fired after he asked me to be his boyfriend and I ignored him.  The store is also very cliquish and if you are not one of the clique, you are harassed.  In the support departments, new hires are coached on who"
bad,"Lets start with the good, The fellow associates are great fun people to work with. Everyone is always willing to help you out when needed and the day goes fast. Now for the bad.. The only thing car max cares about is numbers, When you first get to work you get drilled on numbers. Typically you get 15mins to do a car, In buffing its the same. 15mins to buff a scratched to death black car with three stages of compound. If it's not done in 15mins management is right next to you drilling you on what's taking so long but at the same time you will get a talking on why the car isn't good enough for them once it goes threw the final quality check after they made you rush the cars. They want to have numbers and great quality at the same time which is next to impossible. Quality can't be rushed and car max can't understand that. carmax has standards on how many scratches are acceptable and recently I have been told I'm doing my job to well which is also holding me back from getting my raise! They pick on people they don't like and move up who's buddy buddy with the leads. The sad thing is carmax was not always like this, It used to be a really fun place to work and I enjoyed getting up everyday to go to work until recently we had some changes in management which is really making the experience horrible. I'm sure not all car max locations treat the employees poorly but this one in general is terrible. My experience is becoming harassment."
bad,I worked at this company for almost 5 years. Most of the 5 years were pretty good but when I had some personal changes to my life the company was not willing to make adjustment. This made the work life balance impossible to manage.
bad,"clock in and work the register. Sometimes your allowed to do floor reconciling. The corporate office makes the schedule, and the store opens very early on sundays. "
bad,"A typical day at work starts at 2 pm and ends at 1:30 am four times a week. I learned what a Fortune 500 company values most, being the profit margins. Management uses certain language to get people to do things that do not necessarily need to be done under their procedures, so that they can keep cost down. Also when certain things go wrong and it ends up being one or two individuals, management makes all those in that department pay the price, instead of working with just those involved. Most of my co-workers are great people and I have enjoyed being a part of their lives. The hardest part of the job is there seems to be that what management says must go, when it comes to when they are in the wrong. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting certain individuals and being a part of their lives."
bad,Recently the pay structure was a change in order to incorporate the removal of internet leads. This change has left a sour taste in many employee mouths
bad,"Company cares about the community and it’s associates, but developmental career paths don’t exist.  The process to approach the next level is not clear to associates."
bad,"The company has some fantastic visions and inspiring goals. Unfortunately, due to poor management and lack of incentive, they fall short. Could be a good career if you don't mind relocating."
bad,I worked here for less than 6 months. Being in sales in where the money is but it is also where you are the most stressed because if you don't sell you don't get paid. Managers only really care about helping you to sell cars because they get a bonus when you make budget. You get a 3 day weekend off every three weeks but plan on working every other weekend. In order to make money you have to work more then 40 hours a week. Needed to go part time for school and was denied so ended up having to quite. Not a job for everyone.
bad,"My position was in the business office and the main responsibilities of my position included signing paperwork with customers who were either buying or selling a vehicle. The duties of the position required someone who can stay very organized. My overall rating of the company is due to the poor management within the business office. Out off the business office manager and the 3 assistant business off managers, only 1 person (who was an assistant manager) was knowledgeable and you could rely on."
bad,"I learned a lot of skills while working here, but despite easily working over 40 hours a week...I found a disconnect between management and employees. As well as a lack of unity between employees. Although the pay and benefits were great, opportunities for advancement-excellent, training was through, environment busy and high-paced...I found little lasting reward or value of much meaningful significance other than expanding my skill set."
bad,"The associates make the day to day fun. Too much work for the compensation. The company is too micromanage and the expectation for accuracy far exceeds realistic expectations. High turnover and too much favoritism in all levels of the company. The Company is inconsistent with following their policies, Higher management tends to brake all the rules and get away with it unless your not part of the click."
bad,"Waterbury,CT.Like working for extremely friendly  racists white employees are allowed to get away with murder,Spanish employees fired for minor infractions of company policy,black employees are almost non existent"
bad,"Only thing I miss is the wholesale cars. Other then that I was a greasy job with people willing to throw the blame with no regard for the livelihood of orher, just a pawn in a game."
bad,"I worked here for 5 years through multiple departments before ultimately quitting due to the harrassment, lying, and bullying from management and leads. Extremely corrupt and toxic culture. No action taken by HR or upper management after the investigation. So much wrong with this location it'd be better to bulldoze and rebuild."
bad,Earnings never met what I was told. although it was extremely seasonal at the location I worked at. I would not recommend this job to most. Did have solid benefits.
bad,"Worked as an automotive technician here for almost 2 years. I watched as this increasingly became a terrible place to work. Majority of management has no clue how to run a business. Would continually hear management claim to hold employees accountable, yet do nothing when other employees poor work ethic and inability to clean up after themselves negatively impacted my output. Was finally terminated after I retrieved my property that had been stolen by another employee, other employee had no action taken against them."
bad,"This job is great for someone with unlimited time on their hands. Hourly OR commission whichever is higher. Poor work-life balance managers, and  out only for themselves and their bonuses. Management would rather  you split a deal than get the full commission if it’s your day off or can’t make it in so they get a unit for the store. Definitely play favorites, if you sell cars you can do whatever you want. Managers definitely play favorites and think selling cars is the easiest job in the world, which it can be but that’s not always the case. If you’re expecting a 40 per week job then this is definitely not for you. You’re schedule revolves around the customers, so if you’re off at 6 doesn’t mean you’re going home at 6. This is definitely a sales job and a grind, you can make money if you’re willing to work 50-plus hours per week."
bad,"As long as you are doing everything they want you to when they want it done there is never a problem. The job I was hired to do actually was utilized 30% of the time. Was asked to do so much associate opinion work, rarely did I have time to do what I actually should be be doing. Don't get me wrong, I loved working with the group of people I managed, some of the best times I've ever had, but beware, if you say or do anything and I mean anything that offend anyone in the slightest, you will not be there more than a week, even if it is a personal conversation that is not directed at anyone. Easy come easy go, even if after 22 years of long hard days of dedication and sacrifice."
bad,"Stressful work. low pay. bad managers. work nonengaging. benefits subpar at best. the quality control standards and at the same time, disturbing lax for some and stringent for others"
bad,"Good place to work but the compensation wasn't too competitive."
bad,Had to many people complaining every one was always mad and people were always fighting for work too many confused techs and not everyone had tools the way I did and the work lode was not all that good
bad,"Wash cars in the front lot, didn't learn much due to me having the job of being a car wash specialist instead of a reconditioning associate. Management didn't work with you or help out with other managers."
bad,"Great pay, but the hours are very long and you will be very burn out when you get home. However you do get weekends off. The  main issues is no one likes you. Sales hates you, customers are mad that they have to get there car fixed, and the techs hate working on certain cars. Being good at diffusing tense situations is key."
bad,The 30 day training was very thorough and long. The environment at Car Max was very upbeat and friendly. the managers were very helpful and nice. I just was not cut out to be a car salesman.
bad,Carmax would be a better work place in my opinion if we were paid a little more considering all we do. Scheduling is another thing that should be a lot better.
bad,Good benefits and had a good training experience. They are really good a building employees up to be a better team. Loved the all experience of CarMax. Made a lot of long term friends.
bad,"It was okay, okay people to work with. they dont train well or promote at all"
bad,"Carmax is a good company, but this place is one very stressful place to work. if you dont reach your numbers u will most def hear about it in a negative way."
bad,good place to work and good working conditions and not enough help in doing the required job. Need better direction in the working hours and the time of the day.
bad,"Very Poor management at north location that likes to micro manage employees but never like to do any of the work themselves they hand it down to everyone else and if goals aren’t met they blame everyone but themselves. Aside from very poor management,  employees are very cool people to work with"
bad,"The consultants are always willing to help you in any way they can, they all want to do the best job they can. The managers are also willing to help in the development of the associates, and to sell cars."
bad,"Managers love to micro manage and come up with new rules and guidelines that do not always align with the company's as a whole."
bad,A typical day working at CarMax is hectic. There is never an opportunity for you to be bored because you are always moving in a fast pace environment. It gives you an opportunity to problem solve as fast as possible.
bad,Everything about this job was easy to do as long as you're willing to learn everyday. Management was very nice and easy to get along with for the most part.
bad,Ok place to work coworkers are nice people and fun to work with and help other techs  management at times make the vehicle you are working on go thur the system with something that needed repair but they said not to do the repair
bad,In my work Im happy yet its hard because Im working with passion nad i love my work but sometimes its hard because sometimes I deal with a bad customer and when we get scolded with our manger but if you work with With your heart it does not matter at all as long as your happy because the hard part is just a trials.
good,Carmax as a whole is a Great Company. They care for the employees and provide good benefits. The store level can be a bit different due to management with in the store.
good,"Had a great initial interview with this company however, the employees are overworked and underpaid. The business seems to have a heavy workload adding a lot of stress to the body and mind. Staffing is nice"
good,long hours and management will give sales to the people that are personal friends .  you have to maintain a goal which you have no control over and if you dont and didnt know about it you receive a bad observation
good,Talked on the phone all day long.  That is it.  customers complained all day like they were not aware that they had a car payment due each month.  The management was like high school children.  So happy to have resigned.
good,This company used to be amazing. They switched every manager in the last year. It is horrible and they don't care about the associate. I feel that the management only had their personal life as their interest
good,Be prepared as an salary employee to work 12+ hrs shift. Sometimes 6 to 7 days straight Although the company does well with training. You will not enjoy a good work life balance. You can move up in the company only if you are willing to relocate to different stories multiple time. Be prepared both mentality and physical
good,nothing else to say it was just a job. very bad micromanagement and you will have no work life balance. if you want to know a secret of the company go part time you will sell just as much as the full time people will.
good,Looking for a job to grow with and a job that shows more team work and more pay. I learned to build and work on Courageous leadership with this company. The hardest part of this job was to get the management to care about their employees.
good,"Great work environment and possibility of advancement but managers will show favoritism at times and the schedule can suck, along with inadequate pay."
good,"Management is terrible. Hiring methods are questionable as I have witnessed addicts and thieves get hired. They make it seem as if it is difficult to get a job with CarMax. That may be true, but it’s hard for me to believe after seeing some of the morons come through there. Management is also not short of morons. Nonetheless, the job is extremely effortless and requires the least amount of mental stimulation possible. I enjoyed it because it was quick and easy money while I attended city college."
good,"I know they’re listed on the Fortune Best 100 to Work For, and I can tell you, it’s not due to the customer service financing side of the company. It’s poorly managed. No one in leadership knows how to do their job. They micromanage their employees ALL day and don’t care about the customers. Their written guidelines are either outdated or do not exist at all. Customers are given incorrect and incomplete information. The call center is run like a juvenile detention center. This place is a joke. I’m curious as to whether or not the whole company is this way. Not a good look at all. I was sold a Dream."
good,"micro managed, impossible to advance, have to attend many meetings that are unpaid, work schedule changes at managers will weather there is work or not managers retaliate all the time , always a surprise if you miss any time."
good,"Carmax is like any other retailer that tries to make you feel like you are part of a family. The reality is at the end of the day, they look at their associates as an expense rather than an investment. Current changes within Carmax have shown that the company like most retailers have found a way to cut an “expense” off the bottom line, their people. Very detailed focus if it is the hyper focused area of the week, with a protect yourself first feel from office to office. Overall let down with changing careers to come to Carmax."
good,"Let me begin by stating that I was always a top performer, making my way to President’s Club quickly, even after undergoing a mentorship from a poorly engaged development trainer."
good,"Management changes up every week, depends on how well the store is currently performing. Good weeks and bad weeks but at the end of the day, management makes you feel replaceable and will treat you as that. Favoritism, no work life/balance, horrible management, everyone I was working with is looking for better positions."
good,Never fully staffed. Schedule never set. Guidelines never the same between supervisors. When first hired I was asked to work a different position then had to ask other employees how to figure out a way to get the position I wanted.
good,"*Time off inflexible. To take a vacation day, must give 2 weeks"
good,There is little to no opportunity to advance. The management is very disorganized yet micro-manage. The pay for their positions is not particularly competitive. Turnover at Carmax is incredibly high.
good,"Great company to work for. Just not the location i worked at. Will make sure you have all necessary tools, equipment and resources to complete the job efficiently."
good,"I loved the people I worked with. However, the auto industry is a difficult commission based business. And for all of it's size and power, CarMax did has a huge turn over on the Sales Floor. "
good,"CarMax is a great place to buy a car, but to work there is another story. I had fun with making friends, but they seem to want to micro manage everyone."
good,"very structured paid while training, Alot of learning Doesn't promote within very often unless willing to be relocated. 10+ hour works days not flexible on schedules for long term. Management is unfair and will turn the other cheek. Store managers arnt familiar with sales.  Commission only doesn't receive raises. 160 per Car only no matter if you sell a 10,000 or 40,000 same rate. Recorded phone calls, role plays, and emailes will all be reviewed. Performace appraisals will never be to appraise but only tell you what you can do better on and what you need to fix. And VOice of the customer is the most important thing not sales or or numbers."
good,"CarMax has the right idea with the overall business model, however has lost sight on what made them once a great place to work. Internal promotions are near impossible, there still has been one raise for the sales dept in 19 year, and the training has gone from good to poor. Great part time income and a good overall culture however will begin to struggle without a new direction."
good,A typical day in CS is logging in taking calls non stop until the break/lunch is scheduled. 9/12 months out of the year the center really busy and there's definitely a lack in budget thereof (not enough people to cover service levels). Most of the customers are   out right self entitled but some are really nice. The hardest part about this job is being completely swamped with calls and not receiving the assistance from upper management as team members do. The most enjoyable thing has been the FWA great for school students. If you are a student it is bearable but if you're  not into school I'd say find something that pays more!
good,"Great company for single individual.verg hard for family life work balance.not sure what else is really needed to say. Pay is fair at best, good training for first times a ales associate."
good,"The other associates are to great to work with and make the time there bearable. Some of the managers don't treat you with respect. They talk down to you a lot, get mad when you ask questions, and give you sassy responses."
good,"It started out a great company to work for , it had a mission to not be like every other car dealer. As it became more successful advocating for the customer became less and less the goal."
good,"At first I was all in with the values they portray. Then I learned as a Manager Assistant the bad side of the Company. They tell customers there is a 125 point inspection on all vehicles before they go on the front lot. I have heard horror stories from sales associates that would contradict any inspection at all. I loved my job as a Manager Assistant, it was very rewarding  helping the associates  with any issues they had, but unfortunately you also had to be in the business office 10 hours a week. There is no training program, which is crazy considering the  responsibilities of title work associated with the job.  Maybe you will get lucky and work for the right manager and excel. I unfortunately got a Manager  that had no knowledge of my role, therefore I was on my own."
good,"Carmax is a good overall company. There are several challenges in how crticial issues are handled, as there is no consistency across the company. Each group appears to have their own set of rules. No accountability by management. Always looking to place blame on the associate."
good,Enjoyed working here but the pay and advancement for staff was not fair in my opinion a great part time. Pay should start at 15. The company is great public company but I enjoyed cars so it made it fun . Keep in mind it’s s an American company so profits are important I worked in business office kind of like finance and title clerk rolled into one... it is interesting how it was consolidated and like any company management makes the money
good,"The management had no idea what they were doing, all the way down to the team leaders. They push ""standards"" that are enforced strictly, but you ask ten people and they all have a different idea of what the standards are. Theres no communication,you're forced to do overtime, pick up the slack of the previous shift, arent given the tools needed to do your job and stuck in one area for months on end."
good,"Company was very high stress in management.  While the company promoted a strong sense of teamwork, most people were more concerned about their own job security."
good,"If you're looking for some pocket cash and you have a very flexible personal schedule, then this is a good job for you. You could work the closing shift one day, and the very next day you might have to open. Mind you, they do give you an opportunity to learn the business side of the company, and they love to cross-train employees, but honestly, until they offer better compensation, I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone needing to make a living."
good,"- Work life and personal balance low"
good,"I was a trainee, so I cannot adequately comment. I did not have a typical day and I cannot rate the hardest part of the job.  I worked with trainers and was not part of the culture before I left."
good,you can make great money as a consultant but the managers are still on you if you have a bad week of selling cars. pretty stressful job when it comes to selling.
good,"The management was very poor, there was a lot of drama and disorganization. It has been a few years since I have been there so hopefully things have changed."
good,"Bottom line, it;s all about the sale.  The sales associates are paid on the commission of each sale, so all sales are important.  Other departments take a back seat to the sales associate."
good,"This job is great if you are in school and looking for something with minimal hours. For me it has been nothing but a bad experience as I have a commute and we have shifts such as 5:30-9, which makes for a shift not worth driving in for. It is also very much a high school setting."
good,The company seems to have good intentions but on a day to day basis the pressure put on sales people is high for the returns they receive. Much time is spent on tasks other than selling which limits exposure to new sales opportunities. They do not offer a base salary to cover the tasks required to actually deliver a vehicle and the commission paid is very low.
good,"it is a relax working environment. lack of good managers managing the sales consultant. there are no specific protocols for different kinds of situation. I'm surprised that managers here don't have any managerial skills. yes they can sell cars, but regarding to handling people its a big let down"
good,"It used to be an ok place to work until they changed the whole dynamic and want to micro manage every single aspect of your job. You're there to sell cars, not do homework on what you need to do. Managers have a serious attitude and place serious favoritism..On any given day you will catch the managers talking smack about just about every sales consultant. Pay hasn't been changed for about 20 years. You have to live there if you want to make any kind of money. Sales managers won't work with you on your schedule because they have attitude and don't want to help anybody if it's not going to do anything for them. The only enjoyable part of the job is helping people when you can, and the people you work with."
good,Carmax is a good place to work at first. Now being a Student and working their you will end up not having weekends. You also will get a lot of customers who are just looking.
good,"The company is Ok to work for, but there are alot of office politics at play. Each day is essentially the same and it gets kind of boring. I have moved up the ranks fairly quickly and I look forward to leaving."
good,"The good thing is, I was always busy.  The bad things included being always busy, very few opportunities to advance, never having a free weekend and supervision playing favorites."
good,Will work from Inspection line to Mechanical Repair and Brake & tire and LOF and Emission
good,"Morning huddles, working on the floor with walk-in customers or working in internet office responding to outbound phones and emails"
good,"Clock in 10- minutes prior to shift start, began shift on dialer and all day on various dialer campaigns. Assist co-workers with second voices. Assist manager in creating team incentives monthly. The hardest part of the job for me due to my experience is to be content with being on a dialer all day, no other tasks or responsibilities, and opportunity for upward movement. I took position as Collector as a way to get my foot in the door with the hopes of being able to advance. The most enjoyable part of the job for me are my coworkers."
good,Not alot of room for growth as it is a culture of promote from out side. I have never worked for a company where so many people left and then came back in higher positions. Very strange culture at the Roseville store.
good,"When I first started at Carmax, they had an amazing team. Slowly everyone started leaving. The team was no longer a team. Standards were never the same for each employee. The good, hardworking employees were overworked and taken advantage of and there was a group that refused to take customers, even when asked by management to do so. Test drives put you in a very unsafe environment."
good,"Pay has dropped due to specific changes that I won't get into. The benefits are very good, though the insurance could be a little better. What was once a fun environment has now become nothing but stress. Management is told on a daily basis that we are having problems and morale is falling, yet we are told there is no problem and noting is done. You must be willing to deal with the ups and downs of commissioned based sales. The people you work with are the best part, though. There is a camaraderie that keeps you going on a daily basis."
good,there is not any way to move up in the office unless you transfer out of state or move to sales. you have the freedom to decide your own path and move about the company as you wish
good,"Management is constantly changing from store to store, to much politics, some people follow, some don’t, favoritism, pay is ok, training for Techs not enforced at all, you mostly gonna be working on CarMax cars only and all parts installed in all cars are from Carquest bottom line cheapest quality available"
good,"Working here is a good place to get started. For techs out of school. But note dont let this be your last stop. They brain wash you and underpaying you. You always feel like your job is on the line. You have to kiss a lot of butt to get any decent work. Always keep to yourself. this place you cant joke around you can easily get fired your ""horse play""  if they over staff they will fire people for no reason."
good,great potential workplace but no work life balance as well as no set scheduling. benefits were excellent. can potentially male great compensations with the pay structure.
good,Unsatisfied with the job with the work too much walking no management support they are not eager to close a deal you bring them in the deal they do nothing
good,"Good place to work if you can handle stress and angry customers. Management provides little or no support dealing with customers that are abusive, unruly, or just plain belligerent. No room for advancement unless you are willing to uproot and move often."
good,"Former business associate. The people in my office were like family. We all got along extremely well, however the manager always had us under a microscope. The pay for what we did should be more. I was forced to choose between finishing my education which is all year round or risk being fired as told to me by my BOA. She specifically stated if she knew it was an all year round program, she wouldn't of agreed to it, yet I still worked the evening shifts on the 2 days I had school. Funny, how Carmax will reimburse your school fees, yet I was forced to choose between my job and my future, I chose my future. Very unfair. The Saturday hours I understand have to be worked, but having to work every Saturday with no family time (working til 8,9, 10 at night is completely unfair. The sick days we accrued and used when we called off sick were put in our files and used against us. That is NOT how that works! And when we co.plained to the higher ups, they told us that was absolutely wrong on the BOA's part."
good,Carmax seems like a great company to work for until you really get to know the ins and outs of the place. They go by favoritism and do not care about employees or how hard you work for them. Management does not care about their employees or about work ethic. They care about who can brown nose the best.
good,Best to work for a year or 2 then try to get advancement at a different company. Alot of employees that have been there for 5+ years consistently get passed up for advancement which is literally the worst part about working there.
good,I really like CarMax business model but I felt like I got lost in the shuffle every time a manager would leave.  Never felt like I was going to make it anywhere.
good,"set comissions meaning that if you sell a $10,000 car you get paid the same as if you sell a $100,000 car.  "
good,"Fast paced. Customer interaction: face to face, email phone. Interaction with internal customers. Interaction with regulatory body like DMV country wide. Interaction with financial institutions"
good,"Great company to work for, if you like selling cars. The atmosphere depends on the location. Advancement depends on the location. But, frankly, selling cars HAS TO BE your thing."
good,"It initially seemed like a good way to make money, but during the slow months you can go days 9 hr shifts without making a cent. Overall not the worst place to work, but the pay versus Work time don’t level out. The top seller in the store only makes about 65k, if you want to do car sales go to an actual dealership."
good,"CarMax stores provide a terrific opportunity for entry-level workers to learn about the car business and big box retailing.  They have a genuine commitment to customer service and typically deal with the inevitable problems associated with used cars in a fair and equitable manner.  The store managers have a significant amount of autonomy so the employee experience can vary a great deal from store to store.  While the stores are generally a meritocracy based on objective results, working at headquarters is a different story."
good,High turnover rate due to micromanagement and insufficient support.  Certain departments/managers better than others.  Try to speak to coworkers before accepting position here.
good,"Good sales training provided that will serve me well in the future.   Difficult to make good money..... you work really, really, really long hours.  Good sales training provided that will serve me well in the future."
good,Pay is not steady.good benefits and paid vacations.management very unprofessional. Lots of unpaid training. Long hours. No weekends off. No raises.work environment is friendly.
good,CarMax is a nice place to work but the lack of advancement has me searching for other opportunities. Schedule are fair five days Monday thru Friday.
good,Although the people are nice there is no room for advancement. They rather hiring someone from the outside with no experience then with in with years of experience. They pay well below average wages for there parts associates. What make sense is not always the right way.
good,"Only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the money is good. Other than that everything else is pretty mediocre. Being an experienced Autobody technician this place is more so about how you communicate with others than how you work. They hire Managers that know nothing about cars and press you to get cars done and looking good in a bogus time frame. If you are used to a commission based/working at your own speed kind of shop this isn't for you. They rush you to get some of the heaviest body work done and then if it doesn't come out like they want it you're the one getting in trouble. The management here is horrible, a lot of sucking up and lying, and if you plan to move up more than likely you're gonna have to relocate. They do however have nice percs, but with that does come downfalls. They'll tell you you're gonna be working overtime for the next 3 weeks, going to be a nice check right? Wrong, right after that they cut the work week hours by almost 5 hours a week. So if you are true to your craft working here isn't for you. Trust me it will do nothing but irritate you."
good,"I have worked in sales for 2 years now. Here is my good vs bad review. "
good,I think it has some advancement if you want it but management has favorites. It has a good mentor program that helps you as a new employee.
good,the job does not pay as well as they tell you it does and the work culture is very cult like. lies to employees about expectations of the job. wouldn't recommend this job to anyone with a degree its a waste of your time you can find a better company to work for. Management is very into micromanaging your every move when really any employee with half a brain can do their job without constant supervision.
good,"You start working here with high hopes of really making a career out of it until you realize in the long run the work load and compensation don't match. It pretty much just becomes ""another job' over time."
good,"I met many friends while working here. However high turnover, management not concerned with employees but instead strictly sales numbers. Hard to get time off and a lot of micro management."
good,"Productivity important, worked well on team QA on items. Flexible work hours great.  Great working with team and Supervisor at time."
good,work on lots of cars how to fix all aspects of a vehicle management need work to many chiefs not enough Indians my coworkers were good people the hardest part was the long hours and cuting my self on sharp parts of the cars the best part was the knowledge i gained
good,"I use to love my job with Carmax. I think it is actually a great place to work if you are looking to go far with the company if the corporate office will be more aware of their management team. They play favoritism to the workers that always agree with them. The management team tells promises to associates about advancement, but don't help in any way for the associate to grow within the company. This place was great until they gave power to the wrong people. Doing so is causing Carmax to lose a lot of dedicated and hard workers. (Carmax Kennesaw)"
good,"Working for carmax is a good experience, but the lack of stability makes it hard to support yourself and pay your bills. I've learned how to budget and how to read people more clearly than ever before. At my particular location management is not exactly the greatest but from coworkers at other locations management is better."
good,"Some days are better than others, all depends on the cars that day, you could get 23 easy cars or 23 cars that need everything done to them. Most associates get along great though."
good,"Company has a good 401K and health insurance. Sales Consultants are no longer important do to most interactions with customers are now done over the phone. Pay is minimal. If you are a good Sales Consultant, you will probably make between $40-50K a year."
good,There is no such thing as a perfect workplace.  Carmax is just beginning the process of creating a call center for its online customer service car purchasing business.
good,"Great room for growth but it is much quicker to advance if you are willing to relocate to another city or state, often times they will help pay for relocation costs."
good,"Carmax, in paper is a great company. The work environment is awesome. But a company is only as good as their employees are. Management in certain stores is really poor and sometimes that makes the job really stressful. As any corporation, high ranks positions only cares about earnings and not about the people. Right now they are going through some changes in the sales process that are not working as they’re supposed to, and that’s affecting sales consultants all over the place. The way management is handling the situation is with lies and propaganda. They keep pushing for results that are nearly impossible to get. That generates a lot of discomfort. "
good,"The compensation relative to performance is demoralizing.  Selling 20 cars a month plus a extended warranties and clearing 6k is just sad because when customers abate your income moves with it to as low as 15 per hour. How people pay 28 percent on a car loan is remarkably crazy.  What is crazier is CarMax ability to cherry pick the more viable loans and sell the sub par loans to other finance comatose, blocking competition.  They are a juggernaut of a business that needs competition for prices to be competitive."
good,"My job is an Inventory Associate.  On a typical workday, it could be slow or very busy at times. Vehicles are received for Carmax and it is my job to clean them for the customers. Some days can get uncomfortably hot and humid with the weather always changing. I work outside most of the day. Some days can be very long, such as a 12 hour days. I've become a very hard worker and have learned to work with all types of people.  The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know different personalities."
good,"training is ridiculously long and strenuous, managers do not care and very very very unhelpful after training, pay is decent if you are ok with always being on the phone & having no life ever and having customers call you all day and at inappropriate hours, you will be trained to only do half your job...the other half will be you trying to run around and find help and answers when you have a customer at your desk and nobody willing to help you (they also train you poorly so you can be fired at any time for multiple reasons) also very cutthroat and people steal sales"
good,I learned quite a bit about how to talk to customers and learn to maximize my potential. I learned what methods work and what doesn't and learned from my mistakes. I know what it takes to succeed in my future and I think I must move forward with my career.
good,"To get promoted, it's a lot of ""who you know"". Management is not as knowledgeable as they should be. Compensation is not worth the work and hours you put in unless you're management. Feels like being back in high school with all of the cliques and groups that gossip."
good,"I loved working there at first, but it was overly stressfully and most people were only looking out for them selves. But there was a lot of really good times too. Very strict policies"
good,"Good opportunities for advancement. Work hours are fairly flexible, but some late nights are a must. Overtime is encouraged and necessary in order to build up a clientele base and do well."
good,Working at Carmax I was able to meet new people and learn new things not only for myself but to help others as well. To help better myself and them also.
good,"Fast paced environment. Not enough room for growth, prior experience does not help move up. Wages do not reflect job responsibilities. It is an okay place to work."
good,"The work was fairly easy. The mentors that trained me were good. I picked up on everything easily. They paid for me to become a notary, that was pretty awesome. Management needed work."
good,No support for my role. Too much work for the pay. Managers are hypocrites. Tell us not to do certain things and tells us what to say and do for customers If things go south or sideways you dont have the full support from management team. Then tell us to do the complete opposite of they just told not to do or say.
good,the associates are great but management can be manipulative and working in all the elements can wear on you after a while.  pay is not competitive for metro areas.
good,The pace is fast on the weekends. You have to get used to retail hours of operation every day of the week being open. If you like cars it's a great experience.
good,A typical day at catmax in my position would be stressful and fast paced. carmax is a very corperate involved company. very small mistakes and hiccups make it seem like the world is ending.
good,A typical day includes customer service to numerous account holders via phone. It has taught me how to handle diverse work personalities as well as different work environments and management styles. It is a relaxed environment but can be fast paced and stressful as well depending on the situation. The hardest part is making all the many components of each department make sense and tie in to the big picture.
good,"Ever since they started opening up Carmax's like they were starbucks, you can expect to wait 3 to 4 hours just to see one customer. If you have a high tolerance to boredom, this is a good job for you. It was fun learning about different types of cars. And this job is a great way to learn the patterns and needs of customers. HOWEVER, I regret buying my car from them, they were unwilling to help me with the problems I was having, even though I was well within my free warranty period. They told me to take it to a dealership. This is the treatment they give your customers too."
good,"I'm sure compared to some other companies, Carmax isn't a bad place, but I didn't care for management. There were clearly favorites of the managers and at times it felt as though there was no ""open door policy"". There also seemed to be people who wanted to move up but couldn't and didn't receive helpful advice on how to better themselves. All in all, it was the people who knocked the experience down some, not necessarily the company, although they may have some questionable selling practices."
good,"do it. its fun for a while, but as you try to make a career you see the ugly side of it. its disappointing. the higher you climb, the more unjust. and they do NOT compensate well according to competitors."
good,I maximized salary potential there within the first couple of years. They do not pay well and it could not support me. They do not have good benefits either.
good,Great company and culture yet not much room for individual growth.  Management was never willing to answer questions nor help with customer satisfaction.
good,The system is no rewarding for people that wan't to perform. Their is not real training since the people with more experience is to busy pushing cars to meet goals.The move people with not knowledge of cars up just to meet company standards.
good,"I have worked with CarMax for several years. Recently, they have made a lot of changes that are cost effective for the company but has reduced room for advancement as well as growth. Compensation is terrible for internal associates but competitive for external candidates. If you are a full-time associate you are given sick time and vacation time however,if you are part-time you run off of a point system which is just the worst I have ever seen. Great associates resign or have been terminated because of the point system even though they are outstanding associates. Managers will not fight for them. It is not a great career option because you are just another body to fill a position and new associates are not hard to find. When I first started working with CarMax I felt valued but as the years have gone on that is no longer the case. You are just another number/ body. If you need a job it is good for that but do not plan on making a career out of CarMax. Don't feed into the fortune 500 best places to work."
good,"Meet new customers, greet them discover their needs help them find a vehicle that will fit those needs and budget, run financing, sell the vehicle. "
good,"after 13 years where  'no known defects' are allowed to pass inspection process,  sales department is under extreme pressure to upsell service contracts.  known leaks, low brakes, high rust etc are not addressed as before and these repairs will be made under extended contracts.  contracts kick in after 30 days but try to get an appointment before then - and very few people catch on to this.  when you do have a contract,  you are sold the moon on your first visit back.  the lithia springs store is the best at these tactics."
good,"Very busy, fast paced environment.  Lots of leads but its impossible to get into Presidents club without working 6 days a week.  Hard work and expectations of knowledge of  Financing is insane.  Management plays favorites.   It's difficult to make six figures even if you are a top notch salesperson."
good,Horrible sales management. Low opportunity to sell since two stores opened in Raleigh. Pay for sales compared to others in industry is low.Hard to advance.
good,Requires many hours and like most car sales jobs managers only care about their numbers and dont appreciate their associates like they should
good,The location that I worked at in Albuquerque had no Human resources department and therefore I was not advised of any rights I had when I encountered problems due to my deafness. Being new to New Mexico it was not until I had quit that I was informed of what they should have provided by law. My fellow employees were great but the management was horrible.
good,"Typical day of work is clocking in an hour before opening to talk about goals for the day (same speech every day), standing around and waiting for your ""up."""
good,"In the morning we started with an hour of "
good,"At first you think this is a great company to work for. They encourage work like balance and claim to be all about fun but its a lie. To really make good money, you will end up coming in early, staying late and working days off. "
good,"i will recommend this company to anyone. i learned a lot from this company from sales, training, Management, and building relationships. just follow the carmax way and you will do good."
good,"Micromanagement has changed the work environment from a stable, fun workplace to one where politics overshadow every aspect.  Low commission structure compared to other car dealerships."
good,daily scan with am shift up load scan
good,CarMax is a great company to work for. The values and culture are the foundation of what CarMax has become : The largest auto retailer in the nation. Employees used to be their main asset. A lot has changed lately.
good,Good people
good,My day consisted of customer service while making appointments and other work related duties. I learned many new skills and improved on skills I already had. The management was great and then the. Turnover got out of control and everyone was managing in with different goals.... When they should have been working together... The turnover made that difficult. The hardest part of the job was getting management to be available as needed. The best part of my job was the satisfaction of being able to help customers out. I loved my job
good,Don’t work here if you don’t like to be micromanaged. Monitored every second of your day. Time and attendance policy is awful which is why they fire a lot of people . No PTO or vacation time up front so you must work months before you can take time away with no penalties. Pay plan is average and no guaranteed pay except your hourly rate even though we are working non stop all day. If you like call centers and don’t mind talking all day on the phone this is the job for you.
good,Carmax finds plenty of things for you to do besides sell cars that constantly get in the way. These things at time took precedent over actually selling vehicles and helping customers. I was called off deals to log phone records or other pointless things.
good,Managers don’t give any opportunities to women working on the service side of the business. If you’re a salesman be prepared for the slow season. If you get one bad review management tried to push you out and try to make you quit.
good,"Great benefits , really easy to become successful, honestly the review says average 30k , my first full year I made 55k and I’m currently in one of the tougher markets."
good,You have to go there with low expectations of management because you don't need knowledge of the position to move up. If you play the carmax game then you will move up in the company.
good,Carmax is a great place to work. However the price for a great work environment seems to be high considering they have not changed the way their employees are paid since they opened twenty five years ago. They do require sales associates to spend much of their time either on the phone or completing training. In a commission environment this takes away from our ability to work with customers. Carmax is a very honest and straightforward company. They do not hide anything from their clientele. Turnaround is very high as people who put in all of their effort barely have anything to show for it at the end of a pay period. Many customers would take down my phone number and call me at all hours of the day which affected my work-life balance. I do not mind this happening however I do not feel as though I was properly compensated for the work I did.
good,"Lots of overtime, low pay. Fun place to work at times. Decent benefits. Be prepared to be pushed and feel overworked and underpaid. As a whole, the company is an okay place to work which is why I gave three stars, but I would not recommend."
good,"CarMax was a great place to work temporarily. As a young person entering the job market my limits were pushed and I grew as a result. There are plenty of opportunities to learn a variety of skills from sales to administration. I say this is a great temporary position because the company's culture (at least while I was there) did not care much for the employees. At the end of the day CarMax sells cars to make money and your purpose is to bring in the dollar signs, no more no less."
good,"Carmax offers great benefits: medical, dental and retirement. however, management are not that engaged with their subordinates.  they are more worried about ascending to the next level."
good,Hardest part of the job is the constant change of employees especially management.  Noone is held accountable for anything due to previous management.
good,It’s cool nothing much to say really. Do your job don’t fight with managers and you’ll be fine. Ask your co workers questions first before going to management. They’ll just make fun of you. Lay low and you’ll be fine.
good,"Overall, Carmax is a great place to work for but unfortunately the culture varies greatly from store to store, especially on the operations side of the business."
good,Can start as early as 8 am (8-5) and work as late as it takes to sell a car (1-10 pm +). Short staffed for how much everyone is expected to do. Three managers who pick favorites and are often caught slacking off. Great office job work just low pay and terrible management. For all the work that is expected the pay should be $16 +. (Base pay is $10-$12) Grateful for the experience and skills learned but until they fix their store I would not go back.
good,"As a buyer for Carmax there is no regular day.  Each day is different based on the time you are scheduled.  Some days you will be optioning cars, doing opening duties, appraising cars, or at an offsite auction."
good,Consulting and guiding customers to the appropriate next step based on their situation. They dont pay what they should but loved my coworkers. Horrible hours you basically live there.
good,"the work place was okay, nothing special. the only real positive thing i can think to say is that it is a great place to get experience and that can get you started on your car sales journey."
good,"This is a great place to work if you don't want to think.  It's also great if you want to spend a lot of your time surfing the internet.  The salary is typically in the low $40's, for anyone that puts any serious energy into becoming a serious sales person.  The managers can either be great, or terrible, just depends on the store.  Don't expect to advance, there's not much to advance too.  If you are not looking for a constant challenge, this is a great position and the pay is just ""fair""."
good,"to much gossip, little direction at times, very high school environment. to much back and forth with the co-workers. Got to be able to work in a cold environment as well."
good,started out being a fun place to work . environment changed with management changes. good manages left poor managers stayed. CarMax became a revolving door.
good,"I was referred to CarMax by a co-worker at my previous job. Everything he told me was accurate; great pay, extremely different communication and managing style, and a company that promotes quickly. However, a few things I have come across that I will not put up with for long, if I have that choice, is their inability to have empathy, and their desire to get the cheapest tools and replacement parts."
good,"Good people to work with,  but too much red tape to advance. Newer CEO changed a lot of processes and added too much micro-managing. Compensation has been reduced this year by new pay structure."
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked around. I feel as though either management was either to relaxed or too uptight. We worked 50+ hours in the department where I was, and we didn't have to work weekends. "
good,"Job is100% commission, no MIT advancement, managers are money hungry and really don't do much to help you close a deal. Can be nitpicking on policy and who it applies to"
good,"great job, but discriminates against young black kids. fired a lot of young people for no exact reason. Picked on and would call young people ""this Group."""
good,"carmax is a great place to work if you are  young and don't have any bills to pay, but if you do have bills and school don't bother you will never make any money you have to be there literally from open to close"
good,"One place on the planet that needs a union because of the management. rules don't apply to them. good productive place to work, but it turns hostile with the mood of management. they use rules and regulations as a weapon."
good,When working the overnight shift it not complicated because you basically get a list of things to do and just complete them before the end of the shift.
good,"The job is an okay job, it has a nice low stress feel at first until you start working on the sales floor. Commission is not the best here, any other dealership will give you a much better payout."
good,"Great teamwork, ongoing training helped me expand my knowledge and gain experience in mental health field as mental  health facilitator, although it is a very hard job to do 24/7 I learned a lot from this job."
good,"It's hard enough dealing with the variety of people that used CarMax services, but dealing with the management at the Sahara location was horrible. My co-workers were outstanding in spite of the pressures that management (not CarMax) applied. The hardest part of the job was trying to make a dollar out of the fifteen cents that I had to work with each day. Advancement was possible according to the corporation, but the store made it impossible to make a daily living. I enjoyed the look on my manager face when the lady from DETRS stuck it to him for Wrongful Termination."
good,"The interview process was unusually long and detailed.  First the phone interview, then the 3 hour in person interview with different steps and then the third involved the meeting with the GM and job offer."
good,"Company has great job security, benefits just ok. Salary not too attractive. Not much for career advancement. Management sometimes does not have a clear focus on what to do. Communications does not flow as timely as desired sometimes. Overall a good place to start a career."
good,"Managers say they're into promoting from within, but have a hard time making it happen, because they don't want to let you go from your job. There is endless ""observation"" and ""coaching"" that fulfills their requirement for managing, but doesn't really mean anything or help you in your job.  They are really big on ""role playing"" which is a waste of time and takes time away from more helpful training/information meetings."
good,"not a job if you like being yourself.  they force training down your throat.  they want constant role play and meetings.  make a mistake and you will hear about it during every evaluation.  i loved my coworkers but management was friendly but had their favorites."
good,"CarMax is a great company but I can't say its easy to move up with in the ranks.  They will talk about promoting from within, however, it seems that its more of a popularity game.  I used to really believe deeply in this company and its advancement potential, but now after seeing who does get ahead, its hard to justify."
good,"Not much room for Career growth, Not the best place to work if your the main source of income,"
good,If you have nothing going in your life and have every once of your life to dedicate to CarMax then this is the job for you.
good,"It seemed this job was to slow for me.I always need to be moving. I didn't feel like I was a part of a ""family"" there like most employeers like to make you feel.It was more so just to get my job done."
good,"Although CarMax has been on Fortune's Top 100 Companies to Work For 10 years in a row, there is much to be said about the most common job, sales. There is no base pay or salary for sales consultants. An all commission structure means you have to sell in order make any income at all. If you cannot meet the quota of at least 10 cars a month (full time) or 6 cars a month (part time), you'll be hard pressed to meet your expenses. If you're a student working part time, this job may be a good fit, but if you're looking for income above $70,000, then there are very few opportunities in sales. Management and buyers/appraisers do get a salary and bonus based on store performance so they may make close to that or even more, depending on how many years you've been working at CarMax. In retail sales, you have to be there to sell cars, even if you have to go in on your days off. You'll have to work weekends as well. Good luck if you're trying to find a 9-5 job."
good,I was able to strengthen my sales skills from my years working with the company. 
good,"CarMax is a great and productive work environment. The challenges they face relate to the large amount of management at each store. Where there are ""too many Chiefs and not enough Indians,"" there is little room or opportunity for growth and development in the management areas. There also is a shortage of managers in other stores across the Southwest, making it almost essential to travel for weeks at a time, making the work-family balance difficult."
good,"The company overall has a lot of potential.  However, the company and work envirnment woeld improve a lot more if certain members a management were no longer there. Environment feels like a high school. A lot of drama and gossip. ( certain managers have a lot to do with this).  Not the place to work if you have a family."
good,"I learned one thing from working there, you have to someone to get anywhere. Hard work rarely gets seen, and you will be passed over for the brown noser"
good,"Answer and route phone calls, title work, opening and closing the office, reviewing and processing documents, assisting customers with questions, obtaining payoff information, verify insurance for car loaners, tendering cash transactions, preparing bank deposits, and auction preparations."
good,You will be required to speak a  language to reach the customer and over come briers. Very intense training. over all good company to work for just don't plan on having a life.
good,"The business office is probably the most stressful, isolating position there is. Therefore, you need a solid group of people to make it a great area. My experience happened to be filled with a depressed manager who avoided the office and made her own hours, and a group that smacked talked everyone the moment they went to the bathroom. This made the rest of the store look badly on us. HOWEVER, the moment you leave the office it is a thousand times happier and welcoming. The benefit to carmax as a whole is you know exactly what you should be doing and how to do it and where to look for help. They have plenty of meetings where you are encouraged to give ideas on how to improve your area and work better. I felt like I had a voice it just depended on if anyone was willing to follow through on the topics. Which just takes effort from everyone. CarMax encourages giving back and participating in community events. They also do work with school schedules. This was not the worst experience and I do still apply some of the techniques I learned but the people at the time just made it too difficult to work there and the manager liked them most."
good,Managements a joke. Place is made to feel like you’re a great employee when it’s all an elaborate and fake facade. Typical corporate bs atmosphere. Great learning experience though i’ll give Carmax that. Otherwise Carmax sucks to work for. On top they have a stupid point system that if you’re even a minute late 3 times you’re fired.
good,Typical day you would spend a lot of time researching for vehicles for customers moving vehicles from lot to lot I’m just multitasking and lots of research and answering the phones all at the same time and also running financing.
good,once you get use to a manager and their style of management and what they expect and want a new manager is put in their place. Large turn over. One good thing you get Sundays off.
good,Was okay to work with. The service manager is a pain in the butt. She picks at everything you do. I had a formal coworker start there and she wrote her up with Ig the first two weeks of being there
good,"Good for a job, not a career.  Work/ life balance lacking for personell.  Standard raises anually, supposed to be based on performance but it is not. "
good,This job can offer stability and a good income but it is a lot to deal with.  You regularly have to deal with difficult people and situations as well as conflicts with management and co workers.
good,Carmax is a great place to work but very recently there have been some big changes with the roll out of their new omnichannel online system. This new system allows for customers to do more involving a call center than with actual sales consultants resulting in the need for less sales consultants. Recent changes such as that and more  in the company have been in the benefit of the company rather than employees.
good,"Cons:Large pay gap between sales and other departments"
good,I was a very loyal employee and watched the same people get employee of the month and win all the prizes and the promotions where based on who where the buddies with management and not work ethic.
good,the job was ok the only good thing was the pay. there would be 100 calls on hold and the mangers would sit around and not care. they would accuse you of things you didn't do and they didn't care about your personal life
good,Good place to work. Only work weekdays. Have ample work. Constant management drop ins throughout the day. Easy work. Good place to for retirement. They have 2 schedules 5am to 2pm and 3pm to 12am.
good,"Poor management, i had to learn alot to make it through a shif because management was always off site for meetings and lunches. They never know anything. The shifts are never the same, very complicated if you have kids or are married. Only thing i like about the job is the culture. Very relaxed and fun.BUT as far as the job, they have no structure, everything is all over the place."
good,Typical day at work includes managing your business to buy and sell cars. great coworkers and great place to get into the field. Terrible management. Very easy going however more times than not sales associates are left feeling like other departments are against the sales of cars.
good,Good culture.  Upper management is dismissive of people below them  Hours needed to be successful don't lead to a good work life balance.  Can make lots of money if willing to put in the hours.
good,"Sales are the primary focus of the management and employees, as it should be in a base + commission environment. Veteran employees are rewarded with a more relaxed schedule, and higher pay structure."
good,"A typical day included many duties from inventory, sales, and follow ups. "
good,Carmax does a good job of promoting itself which keeps the door traffic consistent giving opportunity for sales.The harder you work the more chance to increase earnings.
good,We worked long dedicated work hours to achieve our goals for our bonus and when that time came they cut our hours during Christmas time and Thanksgiving dramatically .  They got the large bonuses we got a lump sum and we were promised 40 hours and lost it at the time we needed it most . I’m not saying the company is a bad company to work for because maybe it had to do with the management at this location particularly but I was let down due to favoritism and now I have to find a better job to advance my career .
good,"Pros-free food, employee events, community work by employees"
good,This job is fast paced like any other job. As soon as I get there I start working on cars. Being a team player was important here as well as communication. Poor management was the only thing making this job dreadful but the company overall is decent.
good,"They use an outdated flat pay scale of $160 per car with the average sales person selling 10 cars per month. You just can not make a living on such low pay and long hours. You can expect management to micromanage you down to the use of scripts when speaking with customers. Management viewed a salesperson that sold 0 cars per month that fallowed their sales script perfectly as being more successful than a salesperson that sold above average not using their script. "
good,"I have worked here for almost 4 years in various departments. As a whole, CarMax is a good company to work for. Decent pay, good benefits including PTO, Medical/Vision/Dental and 401K dollar for dollar up to 6%. As with any company, you have a few bad apples in management that can sour the entire work experience for you. And then you get some managers that truly care about you as an employee and as a human being. At any rate, if you were looking for a decent entry level job, this is a great starting point. If you can put up with the b.s., I'm sure it would be a decent place to eventually retire from. As someone who A. is being considered for management and B. has terrible managers, I have had enough of the b.s. Also, be prepared for no personal life as they do work long hours."
good,"The work conditions and benefits at Carmax are very good.  Unfortunately they fail to have supervisors that are trained appropriately to manage their responsibilities in a fair, logical, and educated manner.  They fail to recognize the hard work and excellence of their employees, but are quick to take action when mistakes happen.  Learning to grow their employees to the standards they desire might be possible if they effectively hire managers that are equipped to do so."
good,"okay place to work, sales people always complaining. there was a lot of down time with expectations that you remain busy the entire time, shift hours vary which sucked."
good,"Associates were, for the most part, very pleasant to work with. Manager and one Assistant Manager were awesome; however, one Assistant Manager and the Supervisor/Lead were very unprofessional and very poor leaders."
good,Hands are tied hours are long.  The company only allows you to manage your team through the HR department which is slow to respond which leads to the leaders being powerless. Long hours are expected
good,"A typical week would consist of you coming in at 9 am - 6 pm or longer if needed. Repeat 6 days/week. Saturdays are a must, but hey you get 1 off every 6 weeks!  Now, most people want to close car sales on Saturdays, because they are off of work. So, you can either come in or split your commission with someone else. IF someone else is available. Very time demanding job without reasonable compensation."
good,It is a great place to start selling cars but not long term in my opinion. The training program is great but there are so many different managers and they had a high turnover rate. Overall it was overwhelming and the pay was a flat fee which was hard to make a living.
good,"The culture is very sensitive. One can get terminated for joking about something like saying ""I'm in the corner smoking weed."" or if another person deems something is offensive, there's a good chance of termination."
good,"As a manager, the corporate office has a heavy hand in local practices.  They do not leave much room for local managers to manage people or processes that are more culturally relevant.  The overall business model is good for the customer."
good,They helped me move into programming and taught me what I needed as well as sending me to training multiple times in order to provide me with the information I needed to do my job.
good,"Overall job was busy, fast paced but enjoyable. Flexible schedule included day, night and weekend shifts. Mostly friendly environment, day goes super fast."
good,"Management was great, but backbiting from coworkers was horrible and to stressful for the level of pay. Sad when somebody can bluntly talk about you in front of other employees, heard coworkers talk about people sexuality, clothing, teeth, and etc. I would not recommend this job to others there is a reason for the high-turnover rate. Be prepared to be bullied by young college students or people without education on your success with this company.There is a lady on YouTube who I should've listen to who reviewed this company everything she said was true."
good,"The typical day at work was very busy."
good,Fun working environment. One big family who helped and looked out for each other. Yes we focused on work but we also made sure we had fun and made the experience for our customers fun as well and not stressful.
good,Company has good ideas and opportunity but they don't pay good attention to what they hire as managers. In my 9 years there I saw a lot of lazy inexperienced mangers come and go.
good,"You learn a lot working there so it's not a bad job for those just starting in sales. Max you earn for each vehicle at entry level is 160, then there's 50 for each warranty you sell and 25 for each gap protection. Being that this was the only on in Baton Rouge and there's so much fraud, a lot of your deals don't go through due to requirements for finance. Peak seasons aren't all that even though hyped as such. Colleagues really make work worth wild with family filled environment. Laid back environment so you basically go about your day based on how you make your schedule and appointments. Hours suck, either 9-6 or 12-9. Commission based so laziness shows in pay out."
good,"To its sales team Carmax provides benefits, attractive pay, and the opportunity to be apart of a Sales Club which provides bonuses & the ability to write your own schedule. To its customers Carmax presents itself as a low pressure, service oriented dealership."
good,"Carmax is the easiest way to buy a car. Pick it, drive it, run an application, pick the lender of choice, sign and drive. If you know what you want, you can be out in an hour."
good,"The commission scale is too low.  $160 per car commission given no matter what type of car you sale. "
good,Great place to work. Would recommend keeping your opinions on how things should work to yourself. Sales consultants could use a pay raise. Wouldn't recommend working in any other department.
good,"Good job overall. Its a ""one big family"" type of environment. Success is obtainable but the work/life balance is a struggle."
good,"The lunch meetings are fun every friday and the occasional breakfast provided and cook outs bring the workers close together. CarMax has many of locations which makes it great for transfers and moving up in the company. The pay is also great , this company believes in great compensation for the employees hard work!!"
good,"They grew at an alarming rate, spending money they didn't have. Had to bring in an investor and they cut costs at the cost of losing and firing several employees"
good,"Best job I've ever worked minus the management. Rules changes daily and know one was on one accord."
good,I worked with every CarMax in the DFW area and can honestly say their employees are some of the most professional individuals I have ever worked with.
good,A lot of days were very slow. Had some good days and had some not so good days. Some managers was easy to talk to and work with which made it hard to make some sales.
good,"I have learned invoicing, I have certifications in Microsoft Word, Excel, Access and Power point, and People soft I am able to Multi task.  I am able to work well with others as well as being a self starter."
good,"A lot of training which is good but you are required to attend before work hours, so you aren't compensated. Good, but not cheap benefits."
good,"-Typical day- Seeing a multitude of customers with the goal of selling at 10% or higher"
good,Overall Carmax is a good company with solid policies that they stand by for customers. For employees however the management needs to communicate better and also not partake in favoritism.
good,If you like to be micro managed and do a lot of appraisals then it's the place for you. It's a good company but they don't have a good play plan and upper management always get's on sales managers which flows downhill.
good,"Enjoyed very much selling pre-owned vehicles to the public that had transportation needs. Great co-workers who used the concept of ""teamwork"" to accomplish goals for the company as well as individually."
good,"Scheduling appointments and multi-tasking."
good,Ability to learn from all departments within the company. Non Management made coming to work fun on a daily basis. Great opportunity to network with fellow employees.
good,I liked the atmosphere and people.  I did not like the corporate structure and how they made decisions.  Not beneficial for people at the store level.
good,Hard to advance if not able to relocate. Inordinate amount of workplace politics. If you weren't in tight with the upper management then you would get very little merit based recognition and no promotion.
good,"Great for someone new to sales, training takes about 4 wks and you get tons of help from everyone. You have the potential to make decent money if you give up your work/life balance and work all the time."
good,I was responsible for appraising customer vehicles on a daily basis. I was responsible for helping to organize and setup bi weekly wholesale vehicle auctions at our location and maintaining excellent customer service  during our arbitration process. Monthly I would attend wholesale auctions and purchase vehicles for our location and other locations in the company.
good,"Very slow typical day had lots of downtime for sales associates depending on location for example a 10 hour workday you may see 3 to 4 customers with a 2 to 3 hour wait between, keep in mind most customers don't buy and are just browsing and you're only paid when they purchase. Paid commission only so stores typically higher more sales people than they need knowing that they incur no cost for additional labor unless the labor makes a profit for company."
good,Good place to start working. Great when the weather is nice outside because you are outside all the time. Always meet our goals by the end of the week.
good,Utilizing professional selling principles to sell cars and create CarMax promoters.
good,Local auto dealers have more competitive compensation than Carmax. The hours are extremely long and paying employees on a 100% commission basis really amounts to working for just above minimum wage
good,Management was disorganized and insecure in their abilities.
good,"The culture there is that it is the one, and only place to work.  That all your focus should be on the company.  The managment can be hipocritial, and have an ""out for me"" attitude.  Dealing with the upper management will depend on which location you work at.  My job had a lot of travel, and the training while good, is very restrictive."
good,"Its a decent company to work for. The one thing I struggle with that this company says they will support their employees in any tough situation with a customer. I have experienced the opposite; customer cussing me out, angry customers. I've presented the situation to the managers and none of them have ever talked to the customer to help them understand the situation, or sympathize with them. They simply tell me I can do it. Which I know I can, but if you say you are going to do something then do it. They will stop by and say hello to customers and if they have any questions they will be more than happy to help. But this is not the case."
good,just a place to work. Depends on which department I guess. In sales it is a typical sales job. Commission only. The problem is 70to 80% of the time you are doing appraisals. A good estimate is to say that half the time you are appraising cars for no reason or no chance to make money working with customers like this. I think the appraisals should be done by the appraisers . There is no need to have a sales consultant stay 30to 45 minutes with a customer who is telling you that all they want is to appraise a car for some kind of non business related reason. Co-workers are good people or most of them.
good,"manager plays favorites,parts dept is inadequate"
good,"I loved working for Carmax, it was a pretty easy and laid back place to work. The income of course was commission only so there was a fluctuation in pay. I would suggest working for the company part-time if you are going to be a sales consultant. You have more freedom to come and go as you please. Work week would be one 4 hour weekday (night) shift and Saturday and Sunday shift."
good,"A typical day at Carmax is hectic and very structured, but you must be able to change your agenda or task on a dime to meet the immediate need of the business."
good,CarMax from when I started to when I was quite has changed a lot. Mangers don't car about employs any more.
good,"Determine market price. Find out the cost for providing services. Calculate all variables, add up to total cost of producing and offering services. Compare costs to that of our competitors. Assessed thoroughly the competitive market place to make decision. Determine company's value by projecting future earnings. Analysis of performance versus forecast. Financial Planning. Interpretation of financial statements. Preparation of financial information to be presented to management and the board"
good,• Stress management skills-Reacted well under pressure and supported the organization when there was an immediate change
good,"Hard working, in the elements of the day. Co-workers were not driven at all. As a downside that reflected on the entire department so advancement was not in the picture for me."
good,If you cannot say any thing nice...... you just do not say anything.
good,Good environment if you desire car sales. Yet the compensations was very had to live with.
good,"It is a great place to work for a single individual. The training is good, the product is reliable."
good,"I worked part-time in the Business Office for six months, and it went by pretty fast. I mostly stayed busy, and rarely had any down time, which pretty mush did away with any work site boredom issues."
good,"I loved the people i worked with, it was something different every day. It also allowed me the chance to work with different and amazing people, both clients and coworkers."
good,"You are not paid enough for the long hours and days working to sell cars. Some months are slow, and selling cars is not an easy task; however, only compensated if no commission made. Also, you will have to pay back the minimum hourly wage if no commission is earned for that pay period. The only significant aspect of this job is you get to make your schedule, but not really because you're always working to earn a commission."
good,"CarMax over all is a very progressive company, however with improvement are many learning mistakes. I believe both the attendance policy which has no grace period for tardiness, and the unstable compensation for incentives are both areas that need to be improved greatly."
good,It is commission. Like many commission jobs there are certain times where you don't make as much as you did say the month before. Very important to manage your money and save for the hard months. They are very invested in having the same uniform sales tactics which can be difficult to put your own twist on (ex: scripted phone conversations and pitches)
good,Carmax was A wonderful company a fewxyears ago. Now they have cut pay and your doing the same if not more work for half the pay. Not a good fit if you want to make real money
good,Overall the company offers great benefits.  Work life balance is difficult to achieve for all associates regardless of position or tenure.  Be prepared to relocate.
good,"What seemed like the best sales position I had ever received, quickly became a headache. Too much change with no preparation or consideration of staff. Pay changes, work demand changes, etc."
good,"Carmax was wonderful place to work up until about 2015 to 2016, but the company has made some serious changes that directly altered/ impacted most employees jobs and the company's operations. These changes have largely involved increasing efficiency and decreasing costs. Many employees were laid off and job responsibilities/descriptions were greatly altered. This has made the company much less enjoyable to work for and  job security is now a constant uncertainty."
good,"You're not going to get rich working here.  Your success is dependent on not only your own abilities but also outside economic factors as well as how you're scheduled.  When you begin, you can't write your schedule and unless you get Monday e-office shifts, you will have to work many extra hours to make President's club, which is the sales level you can begin to write your own schedules."
good,"They have good structured training based on the department you are working for. However, as with all dealerships, it involves high traffic of customers which means you will be on your toes. High stress environment. Rewards would be the commission and benefits."
good,"When I started at the company, it was great. Lately the company is changing a lot. Some changes are good, but most of it feels like the company wants to make more money and you won’t be making more. A pay cut is on the way and they are disguising it as if you were going to make more. Benefits are good and the job is pretty easy. You will be micromanaged ALL the time. I used to recommend the company to a lot of people, but not now. Most likely will move on soon."
good,"Commission-only jobs are tough at the large format stores. Small format stores offer hourly wages- better deal. P/T sales reps work more than 20 hours a week- customers' schedule their appointments when THEY are available. If you can't make the appointment, you share or lose the commission with a full-timer."
good,"CarMax is a great company to work for, but really lacks when treating the associates the right way. It’s a fun and relaxed environment to work in. Managers have their good and bad days, but when they do have their bad days they seem to unleash their feelings on their associates."
good,I feel as though after working for the company in one position for about eight years. knowing the job inside /out even to the point i was training people to do the job. I ask management can I learn or do something else (cross train just to learn more about the company)and was told No!!! I asked for a explanation and never was given one.
good,"I don't really write reviews. Carmax is for the young person, doesn't feel like many chances for advancement. its ok for now but not anything I would stay with."
good,"The people I worked with were awesome, but that’s pretty much where the awesomeness ended. CarMax severely underpays their Business Office Associates in relation to all the tasks they are required to complete and the attention to detail they are required to give. Associates are also not granted sick time when they start and the “points system” is extremely hard to work with when the unexpected happens. This is a good job while in college as they offer tuition assistance, but don’t plan on any advancement opportunities. I was also told the latest I’d be in the office was 9:30pm and I’d get a Saturday off every 4-6 weeks, we are often in the office until after 10pm and you only get a weekend off if you request it."
good,"the work critiques are arbitrary.   For example,  you can recieve a negative observation from another associate for doing something you see other associates doing repeatedly, every day as well.  But because no one did an observation on them,  it does not go in their file. If you are part of the ""in"" group,  things work well for you but if you are not,  it can be a tense place.    Training is inconsistant and VERY scattered.  You will be told how to do something,  but parts will be left out and someone else will have a completely different way of doing it so you hear 3 to 10 different ways of doing something.  There seem to be very few tasks that actually have a written run down of the proper steps they want you  to follow.  Therefore you don't find out you're doing it wrong.... until you do it wrong.   Not the optimal way to learn."
good,opportunities for higher pay with commission but requires efficient fast paced work. room for growth is granted with hard work. must be able to withstand long hours of manual labor
good,I enjoyed the two years that I worked for CarMax.  They are a great company and very customer oriented.  As an employee I felt valued.  The biggest draw back is that their pay scale is very low.
good,"Nice place to work when you graduate college and looking for management training.  I loved working for Carmax, Carmax Auto Finance is a slower pace.  Great for IT specialist."
good,It just wasn't for me. While I was there the company had quality control issues. I would sell cars and they would be returned. Quality control standards were not always met.
good,"CarMax was a fun place to work, but I was only paid commission on cars that I sold, and accessories, etc. Some pay periods were great, others were terrible, so there was no way to really plan for anything, and the microscope was placed on me several times by management whether I was doing well, or not. There was a lot of pressure, all of the time, and I don't do well in those kinds of environments.  I did like to help people, especially in difficult situations, solve their problems and find the best vehicle to suit their needs."
good,the commission was lower than most other car dealerships in the area. stressful work environment. management was helpful but overall was powerless to ease the stress of the low pay and high stakes.
good,"monthly reviews, strict, not much chance for advancement, training not extensive, no benefits for part timers, management changes very often, hard to get a promotion"
good,"Family oriented company, with friendly staff and a relaxed atmosphere.  A typical day would started with a morning sales meeting, checking my leads o my computer, working the show room and sales lot.  I also accurately appraised cars for trade-in value, and assisted customers with finding compatible finance companies.  The culture was friendly and relaxed.  The hardest part of the job was having to tell customers we could not make a deal because of credit issues.  The most enjoyable part of the job was closing a successful sale and making the customer happy."
good,Everything is results driven and never with the associates in mind. Typical days include being understaffed and at times under paid with very minimal opportunities at development. Progression within the company is more so based off of personal connections very being based off of workplace skills or competency.
good,"They want people who are friendly, easy going yet ready to hustle. You will have meetings to attend that you don't get paid for since you are on commission. If you sales are low they will give you minumum wage instead of commission, but they won't float you too many months like that."
good,Carmax provides great training for entry level sales and the corporate culture is great. Unfortunately that culture does not always translate to the store level and mid-level management is grossly underpaid and under appreciated.
good,"8 hrs/day, "
good,"Workplace is great. I feel anyone can have any different experience they choose to have based on your perspective and who works with you. Started here not feeling equal but just like any other place you work. There is ego, entitlement and prejudgment. Slowly building rapport with every co worker and environment changed for the better. Hopefully one day the CEO can change that. I definitely don't want to grow here and favoritism is real. This is my truth."
good,"Coworkers were the best part of this job, meeting lots of great people. The ability to drive lots of different types of cars. Management were so focused on reports they didn't the actually person into account. When your hired they say there's not a certain amount you have to sell monthly but it really does."
good,"CarMax is a good entry level sales, interim, or part time place to work.  They have about 200 stores across the country and will freely allow you to move about should you so choose to do so."
good,"The department I work in is fast-paced. Work life balance needs great improvement (50-60 hrs. per week consistently). Culture of CarMax is enjoyable, but company is so employee-centric that it is difficult to make progress or improvements. Lack of communication with business partners and alignment of initiatives across the board."
good,"I was not even close to being compensated for my expierence there. Also, the points based system is garbage. It is like you are back in pre school again."
good,"The job is pretty easy"
good,"Hardest part of the job is the turnover in a fast place environment such as the business office and the low pay."
good,"It was a great experience for me to show myself that i could do one more thing. Management is not great. They promote sales associates who are not great in sales to managers to train new associates. kind of defeats the purpose. Commissions is not the best but if you work hard & sell a lot then you will make good money,"
good,"Long hours, nice co workers, not the typical car dealership. NIce benefit package, mentors provided along with training that is very detailed.  Lots of down time for follow up with customers"
good,"Great Foundation for volunteer but no work/life balance. No growth & expect to ""conform"" to their way of doing things or else you will be written up!!"
good,"The jobs are so broken down that my job consisted of looking over a car and either passing it to be sold on the lot or sent back for more repairs.  This never changed and became a mindless, repetitive job."
good,"While carmax is a great place for people to learn new things, techniques, and expertise there is a bit to much babying. By working on a diverse assortment of vehicles, you area able to pick up unique experiences that are unusual for traditional dealerships."
good,Management changed every year and each team wanted something completely different.  It was very much about who you know there on how far you advanced..
good,if you don't like to talk to people you will not make it you do learn a lot about the car business and the best ways to buy a car. as far as management goes I would depending on where your at can be good or bad the one I was at never promoted to upper management you had to transfer from that store to another to have a chance I was there for 3 years and not once did a person be promoted yet at the other store they always had people being moved up.
good,Long hours and management are all friends so if you discussed a concern within the work place everyone knew. Advancement was limited. The most enjoyable part of my job was the mechanics.
good,Some of the managers always take the customer's word over the employees. This is wrong and make you feel that you cannot trust management. Some of the manager's would push us extra hard to sell the accessories so hard until I lost my customer.
good,worked at the Burbank store location. store is very busy and often times can be chaotic. store is 75-80% appraisal business and have too many salespeople working there so it can be difficult to make the  amount of commission you want to make in sales.  team work among other salespeople is exceptional
good,"typical day come in meet your daily numbers."
good,"That's right. CarMax does sell new cars! In this case a lonely new Toyota across the street from the Laurel Superstore. The folks at CarMax are awesome! I do have issues specifically with the new Toyota dealership, however. I'll encapsulate first then go into detail if you're interested. Simply put: CarMax prides itself on being a stress free no haggle car buying experience. Problem is the pricing on the new cars is not competitive with the other new Toyota dealerships in the mid Atlantic region. So now we have to sell cars that do not have the best price. And we can't haggle because we aren't allowed. If it's no haggle then you must have the best price. But they don't. As a technology guy I was mystified by some of the late coming of no-brainer technology such as advertising. It was very common to have customers come in and state that they did not know we where there. That needed to be fixed. To have the LGM come over and announce a video advertisement for the dealership with such pride was almost funny. YouTube has been around since 2005; why did you wait until 2015 to put an ad up? A lot more work could be done to get the dealership on the map with local customers. In my humble opinion they were monkeying with the car pricing trying to eek out ever penny of profit. Unfortunately, that translates to some very hungry Sales Consultants. Also, don't quit. Even if on good terms they will NOT hire you back."
good,"Carmax really isn't too bad of a place to work if you like to be timed, watched, and feel like just a number. The store I worked at is a production store, which is basically an assembly line. You have a certain amount of time to finish your task. For an Reconditioning Associate, that means buffing or wet sanding on a car, washing a car, touching up a car and cleaning the interior. You have to get out a certain amount of cars per day, and if you don't you get frowned upon, and a small lecture on why you didn't meet your goals. Sometimes you had to stay an extra hour or two on Friday to get it done. The list of standards are absurd and you have to follow these exactly or you won't be ""certified"" in your area and you won't get promoted. "
good,"Overall car max was good.The pay structure was not so good."
good,"Being a car salesman isn't for everyone, and certainly wasn't for me. You have to sacrifice a lot of personal time to get a car sale, and in my case I had to sacrifice more than I want to admit. There were over 40 car salesman on the floor at the same time competing for a sale which was way too much considering the traffic the Carmax I worked for had. I was not pleased at all after I got out of training to see this. If you are a hard working individual and can find a store that doesn't have a lot of inside competition this job is for you. There are people that make a great living working for this company, but if you are someone who doesn't take things seriously I would look somewhere else."
good,"-Retail environment. As a manager expect to work 50+ hours per week."
good,Great company with awesome people to work with.  The hardest part is having so much down time when I am used to a work environment that is always on the go.
good,The problem with the company is they are a victim of their own success. Training is very important to the company but there is no time for it. that's the biggest problem for the company since you need to complete training to advance.
good,"Not your normal auto sales job at all. Most salespeople at CarMax have never sold prior to working there. It is more like selling televisions than cars, no price haggle at all. This limits how much you can make on a each unit."
good,"CarMax is exactly what the business of used car sales is. "
good,"10 hour shifts"
good,I have never worked for a company that is more committed to the training for the success of its employees' career. Career management could be improved and work-life balance was not what was promised in the job interview
good,"Sales Consultants work with customers through each and every step of the sales process. Interviewing customers to determine their needs and wants.Running credit applications, processing transaction and paperwork,Supporting our on-line customers via our eSales office."
good,"When I started the job it was an a.m. shift, the manager was very considerate of other, no mention of rotation until I was there 7 yrs. There was a different manager literally every 6 mos. with different policies from the last office manager. Some were friendly and easy to work while other who knew they were the boss had bad attitudes who did not want to hear what no one had to say."
good,"Very enjoyable day to day environment. Ping Pong tables, team events, along with structured growth meetings."
good,"Overall good company. The people are good, but like to stay in their clicks. The people I work for are very difficult to get the feeling like you are welcomed. They don't invite you anywhere, it is all up to you to fit in with them."
good,They are constantly interviewing new sales consultants as your working making you feel as though your jobs in question.
good,They know how to take the thinking out of sales. My store in particular had a fixed hierarchy which made sure you knew you were at the bottom of the totem pole.
good,The first thing you do once your on the clock is check your emails and follow-up with customers you had previously. This can take up to an hour before you start helping customers on point. The managers treat you depending how good your performance is. If you had poor numbers for the month expect them to be on you until you sell a car. There really isn't advancement in this company. Was there for three years and didn't see anyone get promoted. They usually like to hire newbies for management positions.
good,If you are staring off and want to get your foot through the door when looking to work in a dealership. The place might provide that for you. I saw no longer term benefits of staying. Low pay and strange schedules.
good,"Good culture, opportunities to learn and grow, collaborative work environment, fast paced, great, hard working teams, people are commited to doing an excellent job"
good,Overall great learning experience job experience and training provided great for commission sales essential a great place to work providing quality cars to low income families
good,"Carmax is a fortune 100 company, still an up and coming company that is leading the way in the car buying/selling industry. great opportunities for advancement and great benefits. work is line/standard and people make the job."
good,Ok place to work if you are with the in crowd. Little to no pay increases. Cost savings more important than quality . Typical day includes reconditioning vehicles to different standards as budget allows.
good,"Great company culture, managment is the downside. Too many managers, most of them micromanage which is kind of opposite to the company's culture of growth."
good,"CarMax has opened up a new call center, that they are using to stay ahead of their competitors. If you enjoy working in a call center atmosphere, then you may enjoy this one."
good,"Good benefits they offer 401k and full benefits,the problem is there is too much politics and not enough people being trained properly or encouraged to"
good,Car Max was fun but did not fit in my career objective and anyone who is thinking about working in sales should be able to work for commission and know how to push a sale.
good,"Carmax is a great place to start a career, but unless you move up into management, it's not the place to stay long-term.  You can gain great sales experience and get yourself into more competative positions in time."
good,"I have been with the company for awhile now and while some parts are awesome, there are others that are not so much."
good,Carmax is a good company to work for. They have a fool proof way of selling and guidelines to follow. Management seems to micromanage a bit to much but overall a good company.
good,"*  a typical day at work gives you two fifteen paid breaks and one hour lunch. We clock in and out through our computer systems."
good,"Great place to learn and hone your skills if you have no experience. co-workers seemed to be of liked mind and integrity, making it easy to get along with the people you work beside."
good,Management can be a little more organized. It's a good workplace for as the team. It is never a set schedule...you can work any shift daily and weekly. No set schedule!
good,"It’s an alright place to work, benefits get expensive and management expects too much for too little. Opportunities for advancement are ridiculous  You have people who have been there for years and still haven’t moved up. Look somewhere else."
good,"Multiple responsibilities on a daily basis, mainly inventory management and distribution. Supervisors spent several days teaching the Carmax culture and business framework."
good,Good work culture. Company emphasized customer service.  Flexible work schedule provided. Business office not compensated in line with other departments.
good,"Great place to work, however does have some drawbacks due to insufficient staffing. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to communicate with other people."
good,"Long hours, low pay per sale, splitting sales, losing sales to other store, no promoting from stores to home office, no room for advancement unless  to sales manager"
good,Pay is low unless your a technician or really good at sales. Management and culture is cool. Often gets boring and repetitious. Pay is low for Business office personnel.
good,You need to be very focused and follow up with all of your customers. Lots of opportunity to make good money if you are willing to put in the hours. Customers as well as managers will contact you when you are off.
good,"Drove customer retention, accurately and efficiently delivering orders."
good,"Carmax goes through the motions of all the things they stand for, but lack authenticity and genuine care of others in the work environment.  Standards are to be met, boxes are to be checked off and associates are left feeling unsupported or valued. "
good,i feel like this company is a waste if your wanting to learn because all they want is greed in there own pocket. i think that working anywhere else you could learn more than working there period.
good,Overall a decent place to work. Friendly staff and fast paced environment. Would be a good position on the 2nd shift for a student or single parent. Plenty of explanation of the tasks performed.
good,Always had work to do and everyone worked together well as a team. Things were organized well and well kept. You could always find help and find what you needed to get the job done.
good,"okay place to work, entirely too much micromanagement, takes to long for promotion requirements.  Company makes in the billions and large percentage of employees barely can make a living."
good,Great place to work but management sucks. They pick and choose who they want to train for promotions. They have a lot of favoritism and also a lot of last minute overtime. You are forced to stay for overtime Right before it's time to go home. If they didn't pay decent I would have left a long time ago..
good,"Good work culture, try and do the right thing.  You are subject to your current management, which can be very good, or extremely unfair depending if you are the managers favorite pet.  Lots of double standards."
good,Great company to work for. Constantly looks to grow and be the industry standard. Key is to find what benefits yourself within a company. Proud to have been a member of the Carmax family.
good,I worked here for 1 year and I was a business office associate. I liked my job but the pay DID NOT match the work. In fact the department I worked for was the lowest paid department in the company
good,Great company to work for can make a career out of it has great benefits and other nice opportunities can he’ll you get through school transfer you to better locations and more.
good,CarMax pays way below their competitors but requires you to work above and beyond your job description. They should at least try to have competitive wages and benefits.
good,"CarMax was an exceptional place to develop a foundation. Unfortunately due to rapid expansion of Management it has led to less than qualified senior managers leading stores. They quiver at the pressure of their associates and develop a culture that lacks ability to develop. "
good,"Jobs like this are tough. Management teams switch every couple of years & the whole atmosphere changes. You could have a good manager for your department or a bad one. They could look out for your development or stunt your growth. Literally it's all up to them & how they feel, not how hard you work. The current managers there in the operations department as of mid 2019 are good, but it's been bad ones there before. If you do apply to a place like this keep your head down & do your job no matter what anyone else is doing because with the right management team you can go far & they will notice your hard work. It can turn into a real career. If you don't mind traveling or relocating you have the chance to make some big money with this company."
good,While working there it was good pay but I was always in the car but that was the point of the job I don’t really like it after awhile but I did move so that
good,"The culture within the company is very welcoming. There will be days that are much harder than others, but there is always someone to assist you when you're stuck."
good,"I have been working for Carmax for a number of  years and have seen the good times as well the growing pains,  With growing pains there will be time when the employees become impatience, but Carmax works on improving the gaps."
good,"Flexible schedule if you don't mind working weekends and nights.  Great benefits and supportive management.  Sometimes not enough manager coverage which is normal at times. "
good,"The hardest part of the day is proving to your managers that you are engaging with every customer, many of which just want to be left alone.  Other than that, the job is fairly fun but can be miserable in wet, cold, or very hot weather; Management is fair, but customers can be atrocious, as they are trained by culture that sales people are trying to take advantage of them.  Also, many customers actively try to purchase vehicles they cannot afford, and despite efforts to help them, choose to over-extend budgets."
good,it gets slow. very slow. you must work for everything and sometimes it isn't your fault that deals fall through. They have changed the structure and it wasn't beneficial for me.
good,At first Carmax started off as a decent place to work. They seemed to care for their employees until there was actually a problem. Management seems to pick and choose what is important to them to deal with even when it's a serious issue.  If you are sick and don't have sick time expect to work while sick or get points for each day you need to take off. They do not accept doctors notes.
good,CarMax was a decent place to work for. All kinds of hoops to jump through to get a raise and promotion. Management was really subpar. They all came from department stores and knew nothing about cars or reconditioning them.
good,Good first job for high school graduates to start off with and help save for college as long as outside work in different types of weather isn’t an issue
good,Need to check on mentors more to make sure they are staying on track for training schedule. Did not fully understand what I needed to focus on. Good training program but not as good follow up by mentors because they had there on job responsibly. Training should be done by upper management.
good,This store is extremely busy and fast paced.  The managers are supportive and provide team building and helpful in getting employees movtivated.  Good atmosphere.
good,"Carmax began as a company I went in with aspirations of growth and advancement, and it was exactly that, until there was a shift in in-store management and C-level executives. The business office and service side workload and employees seemed to be overlooked, as the company focused more on the sales aspect and sales consultants, while changing the training modules for said sales consultants. However, the location was top ranked, the work environment was exceptionally professional yet enjoyable."
good,"Only the rich stay rich meaning if you are in upper management than your good anything else you make it what it is, management positions are the only positions that are content and safe if you ask me. Any other position you are just a number keep that in mind. And if you like drama and liked to play games and politics then this is the place for you."
good,Needs some work to be great. Service is not a priority only sales. Benefits are good. Pay is good. Training is non existent. Your are pretty much left to fend for yourself
good,Very fast paced environment with minimal communication between leads and high favoritism. Paid 11/hr to work in any weather conditions. Consists of constantly moving cars within a certain time frame. Inventory is the worst position you could have at CarMax.
good,Carmax is a good company that ive done business with in the past as well as worked for. My experience there was pretty positive and I learned a lot while there.
good,"Carmax is a cool company to work for. Something quick , get your money and leave. Notfor long term unless you are an absolute drone. If you’re a robot and you drink the Carmax koolaid. Not for the individual looking to make their own way through life. Leaders aren’t welcome... followers please apply!"
good,Great place to work but too much preferences coworkers were great get alone very well always there when you needed them helpful technicians great to work with them
good,I learned about how cars are secured and sold. Typical day consist of confirmations on cars from other locations. Answering phones and parking sold cars in parking lot
good,"Do what is asked and you will succeed. Paid for inclement weather. The company shows appreciation to the store for varies things like meeting budget, just because, holiday, and etc."
good,My favorite part of the job was assisting customers and helping them make the best decision for them or their families. My knowledge of vehicle maintenance was a key factor in assisting them. I enjoyed my time there and learned a lot about sales.
good,I did not actually sell cars. The inventory of cars was sold as presented. There was no bargaining over price. This meant that most sales techniques were usless.
good,"Great process, I beleive they have the best sales process on the industry however they should work their payplan. They pay only 160 per unit, this is considered a mini deal anywhere on the planet. You need to sell the extended warranty to make another 100 bucks."
good,"Great culture for a car dealership at the cost of commission sales earnings that you could make elsewhere, but there is no more than 40 hours of work a week, unless you choose to stay longer (which you may to make ends meet as it is completely commission)."
good,"Nothing like a traditional dealership. Seems like anyone can become a manager there. some of the staff is very arrogant. would not recommend this career path to anyone willing to sell cars, you can gross more any where else. & the product being sold is trash."
good,Going into it I thought that I would really like it but soon learned that was not the case. Management was great to work with but the sales people that were there for a while are not friendly to new faces and not very welcoming.
good,It was a good experience but the fast pace does not allow for the employees to feel appreciated by the higher ups. It is great to learn and to get experience.
good,Was a decent job for soemone in college or starting out in the work force. But nothing I would count on living on or trying to support a family with. Great envrionment though.
good,"Very fast paced and training was excellent, but pay did not match up. The work that came through and some of the scenarioius did not match up to the pay. But the morale was always positive."
good,"As a top performing mid level manager for over 4 years the annual pay raise very low, my salary has hardly changed from 2014 until now. The reason I stayed this long is due to a fun place to work, the people are great, the on boarding training is well thought out but the hours are long and the schedules are sporadic. 10-12 hours days, 5 days a week and random shifts."
good,Car max was a good work environment with an exceptional culture. Carmax  focuses on career advancement and also team building. They have a non hostile environment which is a great benefit of working there
good,"Company is good to their customers offering good rates, fair prices. However, the call center suffers from extremely low pay and the place is stagnant with ineffective managers with CYA mentalities who will throw you under the first bus comin'. They are rather catty and gossipy as well. No dress code means the environment is almost too relaxed."
good,"over staffed sales floor, salesmen do the work of the finance department but don't get paid for it. not hourly but have to arrange the lot and remove snow. must wear uniform"
good,"Salary/ commission structure needs to be changed.  Highly ethical company. The drive to disrupt the use car industry in their way was a great insight, but the inability to see the need to increase per car commission above a flat $300 with extended protection is problematic."
good,Where should I start? The Inventory position job itself isn't difficult. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the elements. If you work at a production store you have an inventory building but if you work at a satellite store then you either work on the service drive or work underneath a canopy. Being promoted to management can be easy and quick depending on the manager otherwise it will be a challenge. Inventory Department is looked as the bottom of the food chain. Sure some associates do appreciate your hard work but most don't and the pay is reflective on that. Also turnover rate is very high due to being underpaid. I think if you can become a management then a career at Carmax is definitely worth it. Otherwise if you are looking for a job that is very flexible with hours while attending school then you will be content.
good,"Must be a hard worker and be able to keep up in the fast paced environment. decent work environment, very fast paced, can be stressful, uniforms not so comfortable"
good,"There are not a lot of great things, but not a lot of horrible things about working for CarMax.  The benefits are great, and if you are a salaried employee the pay is pretty good.  However, for the buyer position the work life balance isn't great.  There was a lot of travel, but they are up front about that at the beginning"
good,"Overall a good company to work for. Great benefits, flexible hours, tuition reimbursement. I worked there doing sales. Carmax sets you up to perform well and to achieve all goals."
good,This job was a great opportunity for me to learn a lot of sales techniques and negotiation. It helped learn how to have an A to Z process to close deals.
good,"I was a part time worker so of course my pay check was not the best, this was a college job so i got what i expected. most co-workers were nice which is always a plus"
good,"One thing I can say about CarMax is that it takes a lot of the drama and backbiting out of the car sales experience. Because of the Ups system, customers are distributed somewhat fairly. As long as you work your customers until you are certain they will never buy a car from you, you can do well. One thing to note, there will be a large amount of customers that come in ""just to get their car appraised"". This isn't always the case, but it can leave less ""pushy"" sales people to have much smaller paychecks."
good,Management is great and the work culture there is very friendly. one of the hardest parts of the job is being outside in the heat moving cars around. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we got the job done.
good,It was a fun and great work evenvironment  to work in. I love working with all my co worker and the other staff was just great. the hours are great as well.
good,"Decent place to work. Advancement in null and void though and they will continually place you in ""coaching"" to try and ""build"" you up to the next step, but never actually help you attain it."
good,"It was a good place to work.  Pay was down due to the economy on commission based pay. Typical day was diagnosing and repairing vehicles,  Management was good.  Hardest part of the day was just being slow work flow."
good,Poor understanding of how to respect auto technicians. Managers are hired from places like Target to try to manage auto technicians. There has never been a construction foreman that wasn't first a construction worker. Carmax thinks that they can go aganist the grain. Their policy is not to hire industry experienced managers because Carmax is better and those people are already tainted by the industry.
good,"Senior manager act as if they care about you the first week but then they dont follow up with you and use the information you give them upfront against you later down the road. Leave on good terms and they say you are eligible for rehire but that's not the case you cant rely on there word, although you work hard manage great work ethics and make out standing numbers every month that doesn't matter."
good,"Good store and company to work   , good  stuff , all "
good,"As a worker, you're guaranteed long hour shifts even as a part time employee. The work you do is tedious and is often interrupted by other customers or things. However, shifts go by fast"
good,"they feed us often and had competitions with gifts."
good,"Working here was an interesting experience. The training was very rigorous, anyone could be a productive associate. The quality of vehicles has gone down. It seems that every other vehicle on the front lot has an accident or is a base model."
good,I enjoyed my time there getting to ride in beautiful cars and the job I was doing but I didn’t see myself ever moving up in chain of command. They would be more down your next if your wrong then if u did a perfect car
good,they were ok to work for. the point value system could use an overhaul but other than that it was a nice place to work. im currently looking for work so im in raleigh by capital blvd...
good,Due to the amount of salesmen on the floor at any given day it is very difficult to justify your earnings when you consider the time you put into this job.
good,"Good first sales job, if you can't make it here don't bother doing sales anywhere else. Training is pretty good and management does do a fair job of trying to cultivate and develop talent but it can bored on micromanaging. Splits on sales are given out to loosely."
good,"Typical Call Center job. Pay and benefits are great. Customer service department micro manages and is always on your back. Favoritism plays a big part in this company. If you do not kiss up or are not liked by management, its very hard for you to advance in the company. The company is great, but the CS department is the worse to work in. Sometimes there are really high call volumes and you are expected to take calls back to back with no breathing room and will get talked down on if you are not meeting ""company standards"" There is also no such thing as a set schedule with this job, must work the schedule you are given. Overall, carmax is a great company but if you are looking for employment here, it may be better to consider another department."
good,"Don't think you're going to make money here. Great people, job is more meant for after high school kids that need a job. Not a Career per say. If you're okay with living a very basic life."
good,This is a good company to work for that is always looking for ways to improve. The best part for me is the flexible schedule. I have learned a lot while here.
good,"Its nice but I knew I could make so much better."
good,I really enjoyed my job with carmax. The pay just as a commission based job is expected to has its ups and downs. The people where great. And all together the management team helped tremendously throughout my carmax career.
good,"learned processes and how to make them better. "
good,i loved carmax as a company...and the the people i worked with. It just was a bad management staff at the time i worked for them. really nothing bad to say aboit Carmax i even purchased a vehicle from them!
good,Decent company with stability.  They do recognize talent and take the opportunity to develop employees. It's a large and growing company so there are a lot of office politics. It's a good place to start in the automotive industry.
good,"There was a lot of turnover, largely due to low pay. If you don't sell a car a day, you make no money; yet, somehow the CEO got a $4 million raise. My general manager treated the job as temporary."
good,Very nice staff all around.  Amazing schedule.  Relaxed atmosphere. Facility as well as shop equipment up to date and maintained well. Air conditioned shop.
good,"Easy lots of money to made if you are at the right location"
good,"Great place to work if you want to learn about cars and provide customer service , every one is  friendly, great work ethics and OK benefits, Cant Complain"
good,Carmax is a great place to work and grow your career if you're in your 20's or if you're retired. The culture is amazing and the advancement opportunities are as well. I loved working there
good,"CarMax does have great benefits even for part time employees. The work environment can be somewhat stressful, but that is to be expected with any sales job. CarMax has a TRUE open-door policy."
good,"The managers stress about everything instead of being calm when it's needed, the people I work around is great it's just the management side of everything"
good,"Everyone is pretty much out for themselves. I had one manager who was exceptional, but everyone else was just mediocre. Not bad if you REALLY need a job."
good,Carmax is a great short term solutions for anyone looking to make great money in a small amount of time. The biggest issues for the job are the hours because you are a Sales Consultant you rarely have actually days off that you don't deal with customers and much like most corporate structures advancement is limited. Most of the management and people you work with are great and it is fun.
good,"Provide sufficient information to allow for an efficient, profitable, transaction that meets the client's needs and objectives, as well as CarMax standards for quality and integrity."
good,"Specifically the 290 local, when I worked there was a fun and exciting place to work.  There was a GREAT group of people to work with. Especially the Saturday crowd, everyone would be there then."
good,Is a stead job to begin with if you are looking. Many task are demanded of you and asked to stay late with very minimal pay. Have to move up to senior management to make decent money.
good,"Learned a lot about cars, car dealerships and the process of reselling cars. They tried to make a mundane job seem interesting but it was not. People felt self important and was not a job were you would want to spend years doing. Hours were ok for the low pay. Just not a job you would like if you like people."
good,"Loud workplace "
good,You make $160 per car plus another 100 if you sell the extended warranty.  Probably pretty good during the beginning of the year until October.  After October the car business slows down considerably.  Good place to get some good training and learn the business and a great place to buy a clean car.
good,This is a great place for someone just getting into the business to learn the basics of performing car maintenance. Someone who is a recent grad from a mechanic school would benefit greatly here.
good,I started off as a Technician. I was approached for managment and took the plunge. I first worked as a Technician Production Manager with 26 Technicians under me. Then transfered to Parts.
good,"more like an assembly line than regular automotive work, pay was great , work environment was boring. a lot of good people , great friendly environment"
good,Great company to work for. everyone is very helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. The best part is being able to assist the customers and help them resolve their account issues.
good,"Great company to work for, you learn quite a lot on different sales tips and ways to build proper relationships with customers. By asking every customer that you work with qualifying questions about what the reason they are looking to purchase you can uncover quite a bit to increase your chances of getting the sale. Management will work with you to grow stronger in your sales process and will always be willing to role play with you to ensure that you get better!"
good,Awesome opportunity for a college graduate to learn back office materials. Being organized and keeping up with daily productivity within the office...
good,"I worked in just about every department this company had to offer. Great people, fun work place and they can accommodate for most any type of work you're looking to get into. They look for the right people and are open to finding the right role for them, even if the one they applied for isn't working out."
good,Its very team oriented and company is very relaxed and values the associates opinions. I have enjoyed my experience with this company.
good,"- Job was exciting at the start, but company is run by Wall Street.  In South Florida the work load is a lot higher than most other regions, so working on career advancement is difficult when the customer and business is so busy.  Most decisions have become very political and the quality of worker is not what is was 5+ years ago.  Carmax has gotten big and you start to feel like a number.  Management has become more reactive than proactive in decisions."
good,"The hardest part of my job is the elements."
good,"Management is poor and unhelpful, only interested in company needs and not the needs of the employee. hardest part of the job is dealing with the managers who all act as if they are better than regular store associates."
good,"Consistently moving cars in and out, and placing them in proper positions to be build if they meet our standards. Gained skills in cosmetic interior and exterior inspections."
good,CarMax is a great place to work but they need to look at the 2 shift issues. An overnight shift for automotive can be hard on your family and your health.
good,Very chill job no hard work is required just boring and repetitive. There are alot of cool people that work here made many cool friends.
good,Lots of training which is good commission is set no matter what you sell must meet numbers they do micro manage there are employee referral bonuses
good,"Não tenho nenhum senão, sempre tive liberdade pra trabalhar e assim obter um ótimo retorno, junto aos colegas de equipe."
good,Was a great place to work with a lot advancement potential.Long Hours and Sunday work was a negative. Great Company and Management. I left because of the death of my father.
good,"Working at Carmax is enjoyable.I loved meeting the customers. Unfortunately it is a commission based pay. This system does not build a trust system. Employees can be very cliquey and will stick together to put themselves into your deal, giving them a portion of your deal. Managers really have no way to stop this other than counseling the consultant saying you can't do this. It's very nerve racking to do your job and watch your back."
good,"It was basically appraising cars for customers and also selling cars on a daily basis. My job entails talking to clients on the phone about the cars that they are interested in, setting appointments and doing test drives on cars."
good,"All about numbers and percentages, very strict company, somewhat good management, all about the money, dress code strictly enforced."
good,Its a great learning experience and fun place to work. Its a great place to build office skills and great experience for those looking to get an experience in a sales environment
good,"Good training program. Effective if you are willing to ""drink the CarMax Cool Aid"""
good,Company with good benefits and upward mobility.  Scheduling makes it hard to have a good work/life balance.  Only get consecutive days off every  six weeks.
good,"Good Management"
good,Great Coworker which are very caring.  Unfortunately new management hire is pathetic.  Everyday is busy and consists of a lot of multitasking.
good,"-Assisting customers nationwide by answering questions concerning the vehicle of their choice. "
good,Depending on what station you are working dictates how long you have to perform that task. Some stations have faster pace times than other stations. Management is friendly. The co-workers are very friendly and I feel they are the best part of the job.
good,"I started working at CarMax as an inexperienced sales associate. I did not receive adequate training from CarMax themselves.  This mostly comes from being trained by sales associates that are paid off commission so it is easy for them to pay more attention to their sales than to training.  It defiantly doesn't help that they aren't paid hourly.  "
good,this was a very nice workplace with nice manager and  nice employees. the workplace is very friendly and you will never feel out-of-place at CarMax
good,I worked for them over 15 years ago. They were good at selling used cars. Management was ok. Not a bad place to work for. Pay was ok. Not many raises.
good,"Constant and continued challenges found within the stores. Much management meetings making it difficult to allow needed time to manage your department. Round the clock accountability for your staff or team. Management does not hear your issues they just expect you to fix them on your own which can be difficult without some support. You are involved in many aspects outside of your department such as, attending weekly hiring events for recruits in other store positions. You must be willing to work any shift and all days to be considered for hire. This is a very demanding job and not for the weak. Job first and family second."
good,I love working with people and helping them get into the car that they love.
good,"Good pay, awesome employees, company takes care of every associate. There is so much to learn and a lot of room to grow and move up within the company.And not to mention awesome benefits."
good,Learned numerous amount of business improving skills. Worked as a team.
good,"I've worked in accounting for more than 5, but less than 10 years.  The fun culture, friendly people, flexible hours and casual dress code have made CarMax's corporate office a comfortable, mostly enjoyable, place to work.  The company is highly invested in maintaining a favorable reputation in the communities surrounding their stores, and in the national media.  There's a lot of emphasis internally, on CarMax being and remaining one of Fortune's ""100 Great Places to Work"".  The pride and enthusiasm expressed by representatives of the company had a lot to do with me deciding to accept a position there.  I think CarMax's overall mission and concepts are great and they do an awesome job of making the company look great from the outside.  From the inside, I have to say say that it's not that pretty.  There are many layers of management.  Inconsistent and sometimes unrealistic expectations have led to poor employee morale.  For example, one accounting manager might require biweekly written performance evaluations, while another might do quarterly check-ins.  The unlucky employee has to sell himself verbally and in writing twice a month, while the guy with the reasonable manager can concentrate on meeting his deadlines.  Advancement opportunities are scarce, for non management employees.  The internal application process is, for lack of a better term, shady.  Experience, skills and performance don't seem to factor much into which employee is ultimately selected for the coveted, elusive open position.  Pay raises are not merit-based; one can predict the amount of their next pay increase,"
good,"If you just need a job then apply at CarMax, but I would not just fight your way into the hiring manager's office to seek a job."
good,it had some fun moments and not fun moments management was okay and the co-workers was cool to work with.
good,Responsible for sourcing and procuring new inventory. Presenting vehicle appraisals to customers. Coordinated auctions for teams of buyers.
good,"Okay job, my training was rush felt like I had to learn everything on my own then you yell at when the job is not correctly."
good,"Fun retail environment, alot of recognitions, long work days, other associates are very nice"
good,Has potential but management doesn't manage properly. A lot of great co-workers that are just as lost as you are in life. Work here to fade off into the sunset.
good,Good company to work for and is aggressively expanding.  Employee development really depends on location and managers. Wages are slightly below industry standards for certain positions.
good,"Daily receiving and shipping of vehicles, inspecting hundreds of vehicle daily. Reconciling inventory on a daily basis via reconciliation report. I learned better time management and how to better critique/inspect a product. My co-workers are very easy going and make the work day go by much smoother. I enjoy hitting target goals of the company and developing myself as a professional."
good,"It is very easy to advance at Carmax. One must only pursue management to advance. However, once you are in management, expect 10-12 hour shifts daily and lots of over time. Be careful with outside interaction with associates; their Associate Relationship and Treating Associates With Respect policies are very strict, and are the reason a lot of associates are terminated. If you work in inventory, expect to be treated like the dogs of the company. Expect your managers to pass the majority of their tasks to you."
good,"As a sales associate, hours are bad (typical retail, one in every six weekends off). Couldn't go out and generate business."
good,This is a great place to start off if you have little to no work experience.  Not so great pay if you have a bachelor's degree or higher unless you are applying for a management position.  Management does play favorites but that comes with any career.
good,"On an average day, I tend to about 15 to 20 customers on an individual basis looking to either sell a car or purchase one. Within my year's time of being employed there I have learned a multitude of things about the car industry that I did not previously know. Things such as, how to process the title paperwork for a newly purchased car, or how to successfully run an auto auction. Within my office, our management staff gives every associate the opportunity to express their opinions openly, develop successfully in their current position, and/or encourage growth within the company as a whole, not just the office. The most difficult part of my job is finding a successful balance of my daily tasks so that I may have better time management skills. The enjoyable part of my day consists of me being around co-workers who share the same passion that I do about providing outstanding customer service."
good,"A typical day was satisfying knowing that I'm part of the creation a product that can be the difference from driving to a vacation or driving to work to provide for a family. I learned that attention to detail is a must and every little thing counts, because together it forms a bigger and brighter picture. The management stayed on top of almost everything. the co-workers made it worth wild going into work everyday because of the dedication everybody expressed in their work and each other. The hardest part about the job was the shortage of work and down time. the most enjoyable part about the job was the down time due to shortage of work, this gave time to explore other sections of the production line and learn new skills."
good,A typical day at Carmax is filled with constant changes and unexpected events.
good,"I can truly say that I enjoyed my time as an employee at this company. I would love to be employeed here again, if the opportunity presented itself I would definitely take it. I had some of the best managers. The benefits were great. "
good,"I walk to work early enough to eat before I clock- in. Then after I finish I clock in for a morning meeting. After that I go to the computer print out my paperwork then proceed to go to our back lot to wash, look over and repeat this process over and over until I finish. I go to lunch for an hour then return to do the same work again. Then I clock out to go home. I receive help when needed and they also give me encouragement and feedback so I can do better. The hardest part of my job are the truckers because they come back to back and you don't have a chance to get the first out of the way. I usually can do two at a time depending on how many vehicles the carriers are picking up."
good,If you enjoy working with cars on every level than CarMax is a great company to learn and develop your career.
good,"Good pay, friendly people to work for. Long hours as a service advisor. Dealing with a lot of upset people due to new car issues."
good,"A typical days is coming in and having meetings with mangers about your sales and how to improve them, then meeting with customers and finding out exactly what car best suits them. Management was a little to pushy with both customers and workers, co workers where great to work with."
good,Learned how to inspect and detail vehicles. there were many different positions at Carmax and the was room for advancement. I
good,"As an inventory associate of Carmax you are responsible for plenty. Everyday consist of receiving, inspecting and prepping of sold vehicles. My co workers are great. We all are one team. We assist each others when it comes to getting work done as well as training new associates. One hour lunch breaks and a ping pong table are also a plus."
good,"I start the day off by contacting customers trying to set appointments, so they can purchase or sell Carmax their vehicle. Constantly interacting with customers trying to sell vehicles. Management constantly making sure appointments are set or looking over paper work to insure deals go through. My co-workers are great and it is a friendly environment. Hardest part of my job is being on a commision salary. Most enjoyable part of my job is the environment."
good,This company offered no raises even after one year of service. there were no oppotunities for advancement.
good,A lot of detail oriented work. Must have good customer service skills to be sucessful
good,"Customer Service, ans phones, enter data. Tranfer to the business office. Learned how contracts are read to customer .Explain how customer could trade there cars wiithout having to buy another car. I was tranfer in the back, that is where you prep cars and get it ready for the customer to take it home.Inventory all vehicles. I have learned at lot of different thing. No job is hard."
good,nice people to work with...competitive...always learining...you are rated daily
good,"It was a college job. I'm not a used car salesman. It a tough unrewarding job. Learned how to close, but never felt good about it."
good,"Productive, high pace environment, good associates and fun workplace."
good,Carmax is a fast-paced company where there is never a shortage of business. The business office position requires focus and strong customer service skills.
good,Carmax is a great place to gain experience to help you advance to other opportunities.
good,"Role located out of Buford, GA. Role is underpaid for the amount of work that is required from a managers assistant, aka HR specialist/business office associate. Regular BOA's get paid a dollar less but this role requires more than double the work. At this location, the MA has to be a business office associate and MA in one day. The role alternates after lunch. We use Workday to do recruiting and manage associates but there was NO proper training for the MA to use this system. ONLY managers get to go off and get training on new systems and procedures, leaving it up to them, when they get back from their mini vacation to teach the associates. Workplace culture is ok and people are pretty supportive. Provides great HR experience because you'll have to learn ALOT on your own. Management is all over the place so I can't even begin to have a good opinion on them. I'll just say that they try their best...some of the time."
good,"The management team at CarMax was great for encouraging others to set goals and accomplishing your goals. Unfortunately,  due to a dramatic salary change, I had to part was."
good,"CarMax  has a good product culture that balances delivery of products with discovery and learning.  They have a risk averse mentality that silos a lot of information and sharing that makes it difficult to understand.  They do not move as fast as I would like, and at times I grow bored."
good,"overtime is almost every week. going in at 5 AM or even 4 AM to 3 PM."
good,"When I worked there I didn’t really like the people around me  "
good,"collaborative, flexible work environment, changing through technical advances, focused on employee development, encourage community and team involvement"
good,"CarMax was a great place to learn about car sales. The environment is friendly, but it’s also commission driven! Yes, there’s a salary but to make no mistake, the commission improves the paycheck! The more cars, up sales and add-ons you sell the better! "
good,"Not too bad. "
good,"Compensation was good for kids in college looking for extra money, not for anyone to make a living off of full-time."
good,"Great place to work as long as you don’t try and get in anybody’s way the other drivers only look after themselves they pretend to be one way then turn around and stab you in the back they talk big games but don’t back it up seniority means very little. However bullying by drivers is fine as long as management doesn’t catch on. Other than that the company is great to work for as a whole, however a lot of promises are made and reneged on."
good,"Fun work environment, good training, but pay hasn't caught up with the the rest of the industry. They love to develop current employees, but management is never on the same page. They like promoting to reach their own quotas, not based on who actually deserves or fits a certain position."
good,Pay is low and no set schedule. Very fast paced and you must have a strong attention detail. Perfect job for a college student who needs a flexible schedule.
good,"Overall had a good time working there minus my manager. Due to him, I left the company and all the great co-workers. Couple times got free lunch parties, which was nice. But as i said the manager made it not a great place to work for."
good,"Good company to work for overall. In sales you will have quality leads, and they have an honest and trustworthy business model, and you don’t have to be pushy. The management sometimes can be hard to track down for questions or issues, and a lot of times when you need them the most. In my opinion they do not pay enough per unit. They do show favoritism to consultants who sell the most, which can hurt the morale of those who strive to get better. It’s not a job you want to retire from."
good,The hardest thing to deal with was the salespeople and the sales managers. Try to use common sense and some respect and maybe just maybe...this job would be better. Maybe it's the high authority that they have but they will have a power trip every other day. Ever heard of being humble or using your brain cells instead of running your mouth?
good,"Carmax fairly compensates you for your time, has good benefits, and is a growing company with lots of room for advancement.  However, there are a lot of meetings, high goals, and long hours."
good,"Scheduled for 10 hour days, 4 days a week.  Paid based on productivity and quality.  The more cars you can do in a day/week at an acceptable quality, the higher the hourly rate.  We had a base hourly rate, but no real overtime due to the by the car payment.  They paid based on the type of work needed for the car and not the size of the work.  So you may be paid the same for a smart car vs. an SUV.  granted you can get a Smart Car done faster.  Another example, you are paid for removing window tint by the number of windows, even if some are small windows or very large windows. "
good,"Company has alot of benefits as well as good character in their employees. While many dealerships can feel stressful at times, CarMax offers peace of mind"
good,I enjoy working for Carmax. the Culture is fast paced and the business is ever-changing so we can grow with what customers want. New positions are being created and the managers care about the thoughts about the employees
good,Ok enough job. Poor pay for the amount of work expected. Management somewhat out of touch and at times unrealistic - excessively numbers focused vs what is actually possible for the given day/week.
good,"Its hard to make good money at Carmax, they have too may car salesman and not enough people that come through the door, the cars are way over priced, and you can work all day with one customer just to loose him to a dealership across the street that sells the same car bran new and only $1000 more."
good,"My time at CarMax wasn't terrible. The compensation for sales associates could be better, but the number of customers that come into the store can make up for that."
good,"It is a good company to work for, but it is very difficult to transfer to other departments if you don't want to do sales anymore. They would rather fire you or get rid of you than give you a chance in another department if you aren't meeting their sales quotas. They do this by putting you on some kind of warning so that you can't transfer departments. So look out for that, if you're trying to get to a management position or other position you're better off starting in that department rather than anywhere else."
good,I enjoyed my job and co-workers. The office hours and benefits were great. I left because of no real advancement in a future with the company and the low wages.
good,"good company to work for, pay isn't great for the work that is required. be mindful of who you end up working For, some managers shouldnt be managers and end up creating a toxic work environment."
good,"On the whole, CarMax is a good company that wants to grow and support employees at every level. To maximize advancement opportunities, you have to be willing to relocate, and the management at each store can vary greatly, which will have the largest impact on your experience. "
good,The company and values are great as well as the managers. The pay is not that great especially when at a newer store. I was promised a much higher pay than what I actually received. Subsidy pay with payback was the worst thing in the world. Overall ehh
good,"Productive and friendly environment with friendly and helpful fellow associates. Safe work area, except growth  is not so promising. Comfortable lunch area with television and ping pong table to make associates feel at home on lunches and short breaks. Strict guidelines when it comes to safety and security on the job..Job specification varies  based on department and personal protection equipment for safety on the job with OSHA approved tools and guidelines.Te hardest part of the job is when you are given an uphill task with an expected timeline and you can't finish on time, then it ends with you getting paid less as against the enjoyable part of the job is when you can finish your job in the required length of time with your pay intact."
good,"Enjoyed working with my coworkers, everyone on the sales team at the location I worked at tried to help each other. Your always working even on your days off in sales since it is commission based."
good,Good company. Worked my way up. Culture is friendly and relaxing. I would recommend to friend. Depending on your location and fit. Trying to stay ahead of the curve
good,"Fun place to work, Great training. A place to learn about the car business.  Strict work environment micromanaged environment. The hardest part of the job is management does not recognize you for your hard work and expect more from you."
good,At Carmax you can grow. As long as you put hard work and time in. It’s a great company to work for. Co workers are friendly. Pay is Decent and you can make commission.
good,"Its boring, slow, and mentally draining, but management is willing to bring in food or gift cards to make it a little better for a day then back to it"
good,"This is a great place to start your corporate/call center experience. It has a great work / life balance. The people you meet are wonderful and truly care about one another. Some managers understand the team work aspect while others do operate as ""management"" Unfortunately they lose a lot of hard workers due to salary and the amount  of work you do for the salary. There isn't too much micromanaging but it does still exist. Employees make sure there is still some fun such as potlucks and team builders."
good,While working there I was involved in many team building exercises. Carmax took pride in all employees feeling welcome and comfortable. Good place to work but mot much room for advancement.
good,Good place to work but I cannot say enough that every single store differs from another. The culture is not consistent from store to store. Managers often become unmotivated and comfortable and end up lacking on their focus of associates. Good benefits and ok pay though.
good,CarMax wants to make sure that no opportunity is missed and every customer is immediately taken care of.  This is great but unfortunately this leads to not enough opportunity for each consultant.  CarMax either needs to hire less consultants or pay more per car.
good,"I hve worked at CarMax for three years, and in that time I have gained valuable knowledge and experience that i can use in perpetuity throughout the rest of my career. I recommend CarMax as a place to Start out and get experience."
good,Micromanagment of the buyer position with too many corporate controls. Not enough autonomy for the individual buyer. Compensation is very low for this position compared to work load and competition in the car business.
good,"Training is basically sitting in front of a computer for days.    Use a lot of acronyms and work slang, making it hard to figure out and learn the job.  People will answer questions and help but the compensation for work required does not match up. Work days could be as short as 5 hours or as long as 9. Hard to plan life around unpredictable schedule."
good,"However, growing with the company requires a sacrifice of work/life balance once in management. The benefits are great but not worth sacrificing time with your family."
good,Long hours and management are all friends so if you discussed a concern within the work place everyone knew. Advancement was limited. The most enjoyable part of my job was the mechanics.
good,"Cleaned and refurbished new and used automobiles. Washed vehicle exterior to clean cars, using cleaning solution, water, cloths, and brushes. Applied wax to auto body, wiped and buffed surfaces to protect surfaces and preserve shine, using cloth or buffing machine. Applied revitalizers and preservatives to vinyl or leather surfaces, and treated fabrics with spot and stain resistant chemicals to preserve and protect interior components."
good,"There are some good reasons why it is in the Forbes top 100 places to work, despite being a used car dealership chain. "
good,"The company always allows you your hours according to part time or full time. There are good benefits and health support. The co-works are very friendly and work hard at their jobs. The most enjoyable part of my job is the other employees and learning something new as you move up in the company. It is hard to move up in the company and we go through many managers. The managers have little to no knowledge of actual vehicles and are hired on the spot with no training. They lack the knowledge of work systems and rules. The hardest part of my job is to have managers who don't know what they are doing in their position, going through many many managers, lack of training of new employees (being trained by other new employees), the lack of promotion in the company. The company itself is a wonderful company to work for, but each store I've been apart of has issues with management and keeping employees. I have been in many departments in the company and the training is always lacking."
good,"Great place to work, even better people to work with. This company does a great job in giving back to the community. Due to it's diverse staff Carmax has also created a culture that is very different from other companies. I find that this culture makes it easier for people to get along and work together despite differences."
good,"Start day receiving route sheet ,scheduled work for the day."
good,Not a bad place to work. Flexible hours. In all weather types year round. Buyers Assistant has little growth opportunity.
good,It's a good place to work until the management starts in on you. No matter how good you are (I was top 25 in the company) they continue to push to try their strategies and tactics for interacting with customers instead letting the interaction flow more naturally. They gradually take away your freedom until you comply fully or quit. It got ridiculous after a while.
good,"A typical work day will include 9-10hr work day, management is fun. My co works are great. The hardest part of the job is not making any money. And the most enjoyable part of my job is talking to my coworkers."
good,Great place to work and grow.  Management seems to be struggling with the pace at which the finance division is growing. Work-Life balance consideration is no longer a focus.
good,Co-workers there are hard workers and work as a team. Management needs improvement though. Micromanagement is common and the managers encourages their co-workers to report on other co-workers. Company often rotates inexperienced managers with no automotive experience at all. It can be hard adjusting to new managers and their ever changing rules and attitude towards other co-workers. Especially when managers have no idea how a car works so it's kind of hard to win their respect when they make a decision on repairs. A lot of politics. Work/Life balance can be improved. You work long hours and sometimes have to work six days a week to meet deadlines.
good,"CarMax is a good place to work, like any other place it has its pros and cons but overall it has been a job that I enjoy. I have great management to work under, there is a great feedback process that everyone follows. The pay is lower than average, and the balance of work/ personal life is not there. It would be a great job for someone that is in college or does not have a family."
good,"Our days started off with a daily huddle, we go over appointments, delivers and eoffice shifts."
good,"Over all job was and experience like no other retail I have worked for, every you do as a manager requires a second or third opinion before you make any descions. This make you day longer and drag out and pulls other managers away from doing there jobs. As a salary maanger who manages people and processes for over 25 years I dont feel this proces allowed managers to be managers, nor did it let them in power themselves. This just allowed associates to under mind there managers, question there manager descions. The company needs to unlease the power of the people and live it, not talk as if they do. As for quality of life-zero I work 6 DAYS a week my first year with the company because managers cant manage people and processes without a second or third opinion."
good,"Enjoyed culture, Money could be better, A lot of family oriented activities."
good,not a bad place to work if you dont have a family to support. They flood the floors with as many sales consultants as possible. Tough to get a decent piece of the pie.
good,Long retail hours with holidays blocked tons of responsibility with low pay
good,"Typical day is very busy."
good,"Carmax is not your typical used car lot. "
good,"Very busy and productive workplace, management very rarely seen in the parts department."
good,Training program is structured to help staff succeed. Long hours but the compensation can be very rewarding.
good,Fun place to work. Learning atmoshphere with the potetial to make a lot of money. Values are high and days are usually calm. Months become stressful and plan on not spending a lot of time with your family and friends. Very time demanding.
good,Nice people. Care about customers. Really will go the extra mile for associates and customers. Work life balance is very very great. Friendly managers
good,"focuses on development and team building aspects. great company benefits (medical, dental, 401k). Work life balance could be better. Great training programs for opportunity areas"
good,"As a technician, it's a good place for new mechanics to learn and grow. It's also a good place for older techs when they become exhausted.... What you do as a tech in between these two stages should be done elsewhere if you really want to perfect your skills and earn top dollar."
good,It really depends on your manager. There were some management partners that were helpful an cared to help there associates grow. There were some that didn't care .
good,"When I hired into CarMax I asked about management opportunities and was told there were plenty. I asked for the direct path to become one and I have been led on and on and on about obtaining the position. However, while I wait for the bogus lies being told to me. Another manager gets hired in with absolutely no clue on how to manage has never been a manager before and was walked through the MDP process like it was the easiest thing since sliced bread. It’s obvious managers pick and chose who they want to be a manager based off who they like and not by who deserves it."
good,I have been an employee for 2 and half years. I was used to being able to come and go as I pleased and still be productive. I was able to get my kids to and from school without enlisting the help of my entire family. I was also able to decide when it was and wasn't benefiting me to sit on their clock being a commission only employee. Now I am forced to go part time to accommodate my kids schedules which means I have to work every weekend. Our market is not the best around here so now I am not making any money and if I am paid subsidy for being on their clock I have to pay it back out of my commission. I used to love CarMax. No so much any more. Since new management has come in we have lost about 7-10 employees.
good,"Easy going people, management could use some improvement but they did have some great benefits. The workplace culture was great and I really enjoyed working with my coworkers"
good,"Typical wok days for my position included ordering parts, Inputting parts in the system, Stocking parts, Making phone calls to dealerships, Relocating parts to the proper vehicle"
good,Long work days and a very fast pace along with a stressful environment. I did learn a lot on how to manage people while I was there. Management is poorly ran and they go through a lot of managers. The best part of the job is the other employees who work there to make the time go by quick.
good,"In a leadership position at Carmax, there is a huge demand for setting the example to fellow associates.  You are definitely held to a high standard of performance.  The daily responsibilities between your daily job and associate development are demanding and sometimes not possible to meet expectations.  You do learn alot about developing associates and growing your own skill base."
good,"Management can be very un organized and bias. Management have there people picks.  They also seem a little untrained. They do not appreciate you staying late and multitasking to make sure all the needs of the business is met. They always want more out of you. There will be several days where you get no break however management will still comment on you not taking a brake when they saw you working with customers. they do not believe in swapping out associates so you can take a lunch or leave on time. Management is also extremely slow with closing down the store which sucks for the closing workers. Also there is no such thing as set closing time Carmax closes when The last customer leaves and sometimes that could be 11 or later.  Compensation is Great!!! That is probably the only"
good,Not a long term solution by any means but met a lot of great people there that I remain in contact with today. Compensation is about what you'd expect if you hustle but it requires more than 40 hours a week to achieve presidents club. My biggest gripe was not getting compensated for things that were beyond my control but withing theirs.
good,The training program for sales is very good.  I wish they pay a base salary. You have to spend more time at work to make extra money but lose time with family.
good,"- Great benefits"
good,"Company culture, and individual store culture are good. Pay rate is competitive, and associates are acknowledged for their success, and developed in their opportunities. Only soft skills practiced here can translate to other jobs, and the schedule does not promote good work-life balance. Benefits are not great."
good,It's good for first timer people getting into the car industry. There's many way you could go from there. A lot of skill set you can develop that will impact your life situation.
good,since there are usually a morning and night shift you will get to know most people in different departments. Every one is friendly and ready to help if asked
good,"push for number of vehicles,not quality.when you hit a goal, there is no manager there to thank you for it. but if you miss a goal there all over you wondering what your going to do to get back on track."
good,"CarMax was a fun place to work. The managers are hands on, always available to help when needed. I learned many sales skills while working at Carmax. The sales process was simple and easy for customers to understand."
good,Pay is way too low for all the legal information you need to know. Salesmen can be rude to business office staff. Liked the work and the staff in the business office.
good,"As a part-time Business Office Associate at Carmax, I have been providing technical assistance with verifying documents, presenting financial contract along with terms and conditions, tendering transactions, obtaining payoffs, processing cash receipts, money orders and disbursements, preparing bank deposits, preparing documents for VA and out-of state DMVs and providing assistance with titling, registering and processing tags. Moreover, other responsibilities include promptly responding to customer inquiries and complaints, documenting communication, finding solutions and providing general assistance with answering multi-line phone calls. In 2014, I gave presentation on how properly to process out-of- state transactions to 40 sales consultants and 15 business office associates."
good,The training is about a month long but the pay was poor. I was from out of state and my check was less that $600 biweekly. Great atmosphere to work but lack of explaining pay or outlook was the downfall of my resignation
good,"Overall, CarMax is a great place to work. My review is specific to my store/office."
good,"the hardest part of the job was not having enough hours."
good,"CarMax is a very good place to start your sales career if you feel like that might be your thing. They have a very standardized training system which even though could always be improved, it is adequate and gives you good tools to start. I've heard horror stories about management but that was not my experience. My managers were all very professional and I was fortunate enough to be assigned to one who would leave you alone if you were doing your job, which is what I think any mature adult would like. The only thing I didn't love about CarMax was the roller coaster your family gets put through as far as finances go. If you have a magic touch and can sell 30 cars a month, you'll do fine, but then you'd probably do better somewhere else too. If you're an average Sales Consultant (SC), you'll be running on fumes right before the next paycheck arrives. Not all wives/husbands can deal with that. Also, Saturdays will be spent working. Pretty much all Saturdays if you want to pay the rent. Aside from that, other SC's are typically helpful and supportive since you all make the same amount off a sale anyway. The camaraderie is good and the potential for growth is there as well. Overall, a good place to start a sales career..."
good,"Overall good place to work."
good,"Good work environment and people, stressful at times but work is self paced. Managers are ok, overall company is its a good place to start off and eventually grow if wanting to go into management."
good,I like carmax but we still need to improve on something's its a work in progress some things need to be addressed work wise but things are getting better
good,"You'd never have time to finish a task before getting asked to complete another one, it was to fast paced and you'd never be able to just have one job it was like working in 4 different positions"
good,"Fun job, low pay.  Imbalance between work and life.  Staffing at a minimum.  Issues with working scheduled hours.  Good benefits."
good,At CarMax I learned the skills and techniques needed to run a successful Supply Department. Very organized company but the management team is always changing and the associates sometimes have a hard time with so much change.
good,"as sales rise and fall production techs see rising and falling income. the fluctuation of income is not for those that have not previously become independently wealthy and feel like diagnosing and repairing other peoples vehicles just for kicks. Coworkers were great, friendly and helpful, management changed often, some were fantastic, others, half brained."
good,"I was promoted from Customer Service to Retention in 8 months. Management doesn't really support you during weaknesses. The company is more focused on the customers than the employees. I had a very strong bond with my teammates, they were very supportive."
good,"Typical work day is around 8-9 hours, with retail style schedules. Must work most weekends. You are managed like it is your own business. Following up with prior leads, expecting you to hit general sales goals on a regular basis. "
good,"Not a bad place to work and get some experience. Some great growth potential, but hard to make a living first coming in. Also, many growth opportunities have a lot of competition for a limited number of spots. Like any retail, need to be willing to deal with baggage that comes with customers. Co-workers are all awesome and it creates nice dynamic, but managers can be over-bearing and micromanage a lot of the time.Great place to get your feet wet, but not really viable for long term stability or those with a family."
good,Just seemed like the company was letting people go for no reason at all. Good place to work overall if not for the over bearing managers and lgm.
good,"Love the people and the culture. If my day to day were based solely on who I work with, then I would never want to work anywhere else."
good,CarMax is a great place to work if you love the ambition that a commission environment brings. Great atmosphere to be a part of.
good,I worked there part time while attaining a Bachelor's Degree so I didn't have a great income but it paid the bills while being a full time student.
good,I looked for growth and I moved to UPS hoping to grow and learn about a new business and expand my knowledge.
good,Associate development focused while producing a quality vehicle for our customers.
good,I learned a lot in my time there regarding the importance of giving and receiving feedback to develop associates.  Focus is on developing engaged associates that are bought in to the Carmax experience.  This results in engaged associates delivering world-class customer service.
good,"Took inbound calls from customers to make payments or make payment arrangements. "
good,Overall being a sales consultant at Carmax was a very fun job nice facility every one acts as family the only downfall about part time is working on sundays
good,Enjoyed working at CarMax. Loved the challenge of multi-tasking and the many different job oportunities there. The warranty they give on the vehicles purchaced there is very good. Found very expensive repairs were covered in their warranty plan they sold.
good,If you are lookingfor something while in school. it is good money to live on while your a student.
good,Days can be long but if you are productive it can be rewarding. No pressure sales from management or sales consults.
good,"Inspection of the engine and hoses, leaks, wires and belts, top off all fluids and inspect underneath the car from the front bumper to rear bumper looking for frame damage and leaks from under the car."
good,"CarMax teaches you the values of the company, so that you can execute your job tasks at the best of your ability while keeping in line with the CarMax standard."
good,I enjoyed my co workers but not the pay structure. The company was ok but I wish they would’ve paid more per car sold. The would feed us on Saturdays which was nice.
good,"Typical day at work is assisting customers with appraisals, test drives, qualifying for auto financing and finding the right car. Management seems to be the main issue; too much micromanagement. Workplace culture is good. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and helping people get into a car that they thought they couldn't qualify for. Hardest part of the job is getting into President's Club because to qualify you have to sell a certain amount of cars within a certain period of time and for some people at stores that have a high appraisal volume, it requires you to work on your days off or a massive amount of overtime. I loved working for CarMax, however, I felt that the amount of micromanagement was over the top and qualifying for P Club can be extremely difficult if your location does mostly appraisals. The training provided is really good and CarMax does provide you with the right tools to be successful in sales. I have made lifelong friends through CarMax while I worked there and I feel like I learned a lot to help me further in my career path. I would only recommend this company to people if they do not have a family or don't require time off to spend traveling or being with family. If you are a very career focused individual and you are ok with working long tedious hours and on your days off; then this is a great company to work for."
good,Look if your looking for a place to work or have been working at a regular car dealership and are tired or the run around carmax is a step above that.
good,"Worked at carmax for 2 years. It got worse over time. Managers are all stressed out if pace times aren’t hit or quality of cars go down. Because they can’t bonus. Constantly on you about everything, they want “quality” but at end of day it’s all about their numbers hit. Each station only gets 22 minutes, which is no time at all to clean the whole interior of a car."
good,Its a great entry level job into the Automotive industry as a sales consultant. Great operational system in place for you to follow. Employees are fun to work with and makes it enjoyable to spend time working at CarMax.
good,good to work with the team they put you with but the manager team was awful they never new what was going on one would say one thing and the next would be very different
good,"Working at CarMax is a decent job. You don't get much for selling a car compared to a traditional dealership, but the hours and flexibility is much better. The environment is less stressful than a traditional dealership if you can hire awful micro-managing, which comes due to being a retail company. If you sell a certain amount of cars a pay period for consecutive pay periods, you get more per car and warranty. The location I work at holds you accountable to just about everything, on top of already doing all the financing work and quality checks. We are fed pretty often, which is nice."
good,Great honest pricing and buying of vehicles.  too many hours and to little sales for my taste.  not busy enough to make working the long hours worth the money for an experienced sales man.  great learning experience for green peas
good,"Carmax is a good place to work but on some days you can earn very little money, $7.75 an hour.  I prefer to have predictable income.  I don't mind a base plus commission but $7.75 an hour is no longer an acceptable base salary for me.  For myself I think it would be a great part time job."
good,"Overall CarMax benefits were good and fair. Pay not so much. 28,000 included benefits and bonus if you make bonus. CarMax management was not so good. Why? because this is the only place I have ever worked where the managers were going in and out the door like regular employees. They had good managers and I think the polices were not fair. People were walking on egg shells because of write-ups. This causes a huge turn over in the company. I have never worked in a place where I did not thrive."
good,"I say is good for those pursuing a higher education and want a good part-time salary since is paid fairly well compared to the competitors. If you do decide to go full time, buyer assistant is a good choice as well as parts and business office. Full timers get paid vacation and other benefits"
good,"some days is slow, but when the store is full it does get crazy. You'll learn everything within a month, they train you about everything. Co-workers are really diverse, which is pretty cool."
good,"Good pay and benifits , but they have a lot of mandatory meetings and on line training that you are not paid for attending or complete.  They don't have to pay you for them because you are payed by what jobs you complete . But that stuff waste time that you could be making money ."
good,"However, my experience was unfortunately limited with no availability for promotion with my position. Managers showed little urgency and desire to assist associates in climbing the ladder to management. Most of my coworkers either quit or transferred states to pursue further employment goals."
good,"The job is comfortable, I have worked at worse places. The management is scared to fire certain employees which causes problems for others. But some of the benefits are nice."
good,I enjoyed working here because of the benefits and co workers but management was lacking. They could come in anytime but don't dare be a minute late. Answering phones and taking care of customer needs was the main part of the job. Hardest part was seeing people move up quickly with barely any experience and watching someone get turned down for a job no matter how much more qualified they were than the other candidate just because they stumbled in their interview. They also let go of excellent workers and keep the ones who don't care for the company.
good,Busy environment but flows nicely. The training program are very effective. Management is very approachable and focus on helping grow in your role.
good,"Lots of multitasking, customer service, and learning on the fly. Frequently put on meetings and free lunches to boost morale and  to keep everyone informed on changes and updates to the company."
good,Fun work environment. not so supportive from management. Flexible work schedule late closing shifts. A great sales team ...not so great in the Business Office
good,"CarMax is a good company to work for.  In my line of work as an automotive technician there have been several opportunities for growth within my immediate field. Once I became a high level technician though, I quickly realized that the only available growth opportunities would require relocation and/or a major pay cut to go into management.  I have been there 10 years starting out as an apprentice and have grown quite a bit as a technical professional."
good,"Productive and fun doing a job that you love, but the pay did not change for the different job title."
good,This is a good place to work. Flexible with your schedule and a fun work atmosphere.
good,Long days but made the best of it along with my coworkers.  Its nice not having to work the weekends.
good,Carmax is a very busy place during the day and even at night. On a daily basis there is a need of multitasking and problem solving. Everyone there is a joy to work with.
good,"A typical day at work for me, is giving the customer exceptional service, when they sit in my cubical to sign there paperwork. My day also consent of inspiring teammates on a daily basis, and steps in to help as needed. Every day is a learning experience. I have learned how to give excellent customer service, inventory control, and loss prevention, time management, leadership, and performance assessment, manager on duty Process, creating an exceptional customer service environment, conflict management, and situational management. Me and my co-workers foster an environment in which customers enjoy high levels of quality vehicles, exceptional customer service and employees that are motivated to deliver at top performance. We manage the office area to ensure friendly and efficient transactions at signing, and delivery of their new vehicle as a team. The hardest part of my job, not having set hours. The most enjoyable is when I see my voice to customer scores at a 100%. Then I know my customer left feeling good about the service they have receive from CarMax."
good,great company. its the management that could care less about you unless you drink with them on friday nights (which is against policy)
good,Long hours. Management treats the team like family. Co-workers were competitive. The job is very easy.
good,"Management could be better, four managers worked the floor. Two of them will go above and beyond to help you get through a tough customer or situation and help you close the deal. These two specific people I greatly appreciate each day I walk in the door. The other two always have a bad attitude when ever bothered, main focus were reports and sales for the day so we hit budget and they get paid, and often make things more difficult than they need to be. A Typical day at work often consisted of morning huddles, diverse crowd of customers, and the training never ends. You will be training and watching Carmax University videos in your down time."
good,"Overall it is a nice please to work, but it could be very miserable if you do not like your fellow co-workers. Some days work can be very fun even if it is busy other days it is really frustrating because of the employees you are working with on that specific day."
good,I loved the associates I work with.  Good company to grow with if you are looking to relocate.  The best positions are in sales and management they make the most money.
good,some policies are not fun to deal with. everyone i worked with was great. there is  a lot of room for growth as a manager if you really want to pursue it.
good,"Carmax is constantly changing and growing, its a great company to work for with a lot of benefits. I currently work a rotating schedule and have to work some Saturdays. I just want to spend the weekends with my family. I don't feel like I get compensated enough based on my work ethic and effort."
good,"Working here was a great learning experience. I admit that I wasn't always in the best of moods because I felt like a lot of our hard work and additional time went unnoticed. We were constantly asked to stay later than our scheduled shifts and to cross train so that we could help in other departments, especially collections. There was no true chain for advancement besides the ""buddy system"" and most of us know how that works. I believe the pay is what kept most of us around as long as we stayed but all of eventually left feeling like there was no opportunity for advancement. I would recommend this job to someone that needs to make some money to support themselves/family but not to someone that is looking for a career."
good,"Love the job, culture, and my management team but the compensation sucked! Fun company culture. Performance incentives to win a trip to Vegas every year."
good,"Good place to start out if you have no sales experience, they have a fun hiring process along with a drug screening. After a month of paid training, and requiring your sales license, you are ready to make sales."
good,Learned a lot about how banks finance people based on their credit scores. Being a business office associate made me feel important and it was very nice seeing people with a smile on their faces when they bought the car of their dreams.
good,I enjoyed working here i loved the job but when it came to management it was horrible some managers had poor attitudes and i believe that some of the scheduling was not right
good,"Everyone is very friendly, manager are nice but some suck up to the big boss. hardest part of the job is getting the paycheck and spending it all in one day because the hourly sucks but i honestly love my job. Carmax really is a great place to work for if you want to work their part time or if you start out in management and would like to move from store to regional to corporate level."
good,One is able to balance work and school or family. One is treated with respect although there is a cap of where one can reach careerwise
good,It was a great place in 2010 when I first started but has changed a lot. The store I worked at went through a lot of management changes and definitely a swinging door for sales
good,Seems like some employees do all the work while the rest slack off. Sometimes they provide lunch. You can set your own hours great job for when your going to school
good,"Wonderful company with awesome benefits. A job is a job, as long as you do what you are supposed to do. Just cover your butt. Your manager will not try to save you."
good,"Appraisals of customer vehicles"
good,"Enjoyed working for Car Max, people are friendly and helpful. Easy to get promoted but pay wasn't good for the work, could be stressful at times but company always had fun activities to keep you motivated."
good,As with any car dealership this job is very competitive but can be extremely fun. The team has great attitudes and doesn't take themselves overly serious.
good,"Great company to work for but the only place to make money is to become a manager or work as a detailer or service tech. Inventory is alot of work for low pay,great benefits but money talks,period. Alot of micromanaging and the work atmosphere is horrible. Currently looking to leave inventory or the job ."
good,"Carmax is great place to begin your career. A typical day at Carmax will consist of a lot of one on one time with customers, ensuring that they have the best car buy experience possible. I have wonderful co-workers that always lend a helping hand when needed. The hardest part about working for Carmax is not being able to help a customer when the situation is out of our control. The most enjoyable part of my job is to see the excitement of customers when they are purchasing their vehicles."
good,"Benefits are good, management is good, opportunities for advancement are okay. Pay is NOT where it used to be. Opportunities to increase income have been cut."
good,"It’s your time just use it wisely and study up on your cars.It’s was hard for the slow months but the busy months are great "
good,CarMax is a fast paced environment and they are great at staying on procedure. Typical work day involved getting information on title and registration for each vehicle that came in and out. We also signed contracts daily for car buying customers.
good,"Many employees will transfer to or from other locations to get a different position. The LGM seems clueless. For the most part, all of the associates are great people to work with. However, I've considered quitting because of someone I have to work with. They don't pay more if you have a college degree, but they do provide tuition reimbursement. The store is very busy which is nice. There is always work to be done, and everyone is willing to help you because just about everyone works hard."
good,"If you want to work in a fun atmosphere with great people but not get paid to do it, this is your gig. "
good,"From working as a janitor at Carmax, I have learned that as long as you are willing to learn to do the job, everything else will come naturally. Aside from knowing what to do and when to do it, the job people at carmax were welcoming and were easy to get along with. My co-worker was always there when I needed help and he taught me a great deal within a short amount of time. For me, there was no hard part of the job. The easy part was getting the job done. I enjoyed getting to know a few employees and making friends."
good,No advancement opportunity wish it was better.
good,I enjoy working with customers and being able to provide good customer service/solutions. I interact with customers verbally and in person and I make sure each time my customers are pleased to leave satisfied.
good,"Nice place to work but low work hours.Bad management, employee favoritism.80% of the technician have no ase certification, only mechanic apprentice."
good,Carmax is a great place to work. it is very clean and lad back. highly place to work and be a part of..................................................
good,Don’t work here unless you want to live there and slave to the boss. Good information on cars and learning about company but they don’t care about you.
good,"I learned a lot from CarMax. You will move up very quickly if you work hard, but you will reach a point where you are stuck in the middle of making good money and trying to make ends meet. The only way you move up is if someone dies or gets so stressed out from the very demanding work load and quits witch happens alot. Be prepared to completely detal 40 cars in an 8 hour shift."
good,The daily work was fun.  Buying cars in the appraisal lane and at auctions.  Advancement depended more on your relationship to the higher ups than on skill.  Be one of the favorites if you expect to get promoted.
good,Fun place to work however the pay was not worth the hours you had to work.
good,"Management was the down fall, co workers are nice and friendly but do not expect to move up unless you make friends with management. company takes care of the employees overall but in house management needed work."
good,"Strong Company that has a great sales process and formula for success.  Company's success is leading to expected challenges "
good,"There are a lot of state-specific guidelines to follow, but the work isn't that bad.  Customers immediately dislike us because we're a car dealership.  The business office is very clique-y and the MoDs tend to react based on emotion rather than logic.  The MoDs tend to have meetings when the office gets busy, and leave two people or so to handle the rush.  Sales managers push for deals to go through after we're supposed to be closed."
good,"Carmax is a great company with a great business model.  The training is great.  However, compensation is low compared to the industry.  "
good,Good Company to work for in the beginning. Benefits are great. Changes in store level management have affected store moral.
good,"I believe that in the sense of dealing with people that are aged a little more than me, CarMax helped with the confidence level and has allowed me to be able to talk my mind or converse with people about almost anything."
good,If you do not mind not having a life and being unhappy then you will love this job. The schedule is all over the place you can work one day from 1pm to 11pm and the next day work at 8am so that when you are really tired and you just feel like you never left work.
good,The full commission based salary made it incredibly difficult to have any stability in any facet of the job. The management and company itself I would recommend and the people are awesome.
good,A typical day at CarMax involved helping customers find a vehicle. I learned how to sell cars the CarMax way. Very simple and seamless process where we sold exceptional used cars.
good,"When you get to work you have to follow-up with previous customers to see if they are coming back in."
good,"A lot depends on consumers. You can give 100% and work 80 hour that week, but the economy affect weather you sale or not. Need more job security."
good,Carmax is a great place to work with great benefits but can be tough to move up depending on what position you start in. Once you hit a certain point at some stores you don’t have much opportunity to move up.
good,This is a good place to work as long as you are not trying to build a career. There is not much room for advancement and salary/commission  raises. It is a better place for part-time or retired people.
good,of rumors. The management are ok but you need to get on their good side for them to be responsive. If you want to apply.. night shifts are more relaxed. pro- you learn to drive stick shift. (Depending on who is willing to teach you). You’ll end up doing majority of the preps. You’ll have to detail the vehicles because they don’t get cleaned properly. you get breaks and smoke breaks. Even though the job sucked sometimes.. it’s still better than most.
good,Good place.  Don't become an ra4. Love having Sunday's off. More concerned with quantity then quality...................................................
good,"Great co-workers, very low commission rates and expensive benefits. Terrific job for a single person with very few bills. If you have any work experience you will already be ahead of your manager."
good,"My time at CarMax was overall a good one, just the nature of the job is tough. Used car sales is notoriously a difficult job, and I would say CarMax was better than most."
good,"I enjoy working and learning about new things, although I am no longer with Carmax the time spent there taught me several lessons. My career there began in the parts room earning $12 per hour and I was able to progress to a paint lead earning $33 per hour."
good,If the company policies are followed it's a great place to work. But unfortunately they are not in most cases. Enjoyed working there for many years but over the last year or so the company has changed in it's quality and their management.
good,"For a commission based job, the company underpays the sales people. Over the 11 years I worked there we had only one pay raise. Even though the cost of living has changed, the commission structure has not."
good,in my one at carmax i realized that nobody really cared to see my further my career and nobody was willing to work as a team but just for themselves. i would not recommend carmax as a career choice
good,The possibility of advancement is not available. I continue to learn as much as I can so that I will have a better change of finding a more rewarding job.
good,"Here at Carmax there are a lot of things that are great and a lot of negatives, I just wish things were different when it comes to the employee.  There are decisions that are made based on the past not the current so it puts a damper on moral."
good,"CarMax is a great place to work however, the growth in the company is very limited and many requirements are set in order to be promoted. The work environment is very friendly and positive and is very exceptional in customer service."
good,"A typical day for me at work is to process title work for customer who recently purchased vehicles.  Also, I prepare customer's documents for the signing process and check for any errors that need to be corrected so it does not cause a funding issue.  Take customer payments, open and close cash drawer, deposit checks electronically, and ensure that all tasks are completed by the end of my shift.  I feel that my manager does not always support the team and I have great co-workers that some time need guidance in difficult situations with customers and I feel that everyone in my office looks up to me because they are constantly asking for my feedback because they have the confidence in me.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the team I work with, they are always upbeat and make going to work something I look forward to.  I have maintained one of the top VOC (voice of the customer) scores in the office and because of this have also maintained President's Club Silver Level and working toward Gold and Platinum Levels."
good,I have learned to work successful with customers over the phone and also face-to-face. I have mentored sales consultants as well to help them through their training process. I learn to successfully explain the financing process and approvals to customers and have sold about 200 cars in a year and seven month span.
good,Can be stressful at times when associates need to make there numbers.Management try's to keep you interested by dangling positions in front of you but never following through on those positions.If you are a good sales person you can thrive but you still need to be a used car sales person mentality.
good,It is an fun job really love the company. My job on a daily basis was to sale cars. I was very good at that. The management is to controlling.
good,It's hard to know exactly what they are looking for.  There are a lot of games and carrot dangling.
good,"I am responsible for getting customer's vehicles registered and paper work processed for titling. I follow through with customers on a daily basis and send the proper documents out for DMV processing. From my duties as DMV Clerk, I have learned the various laws from state to state associated with processing documents legally, to professionally handle difficult situations and manage duties required for store progress. My management team has been very helpful with my training and making sure that I am equipped to handle the task at hand. Whenever I need assistance from my fellow teammates, they have been there to help at any moment."
good,"Working in service department is overwhelming due to the lack of management. They are long work days, 10+ hours shifts with 1 hour lunch break. They do not do 15 min breaks so be prepared for that."
good,If you are willing to work had and long hours Carmax is a good place for. There is not a lot of work and home life balance If you don't need to be home a lot you could be happy here.
good,"Not the best to work with, seems nice at first, but flipped the script very fast.  Turn over rate is getting higher and higher by the day!  Your compensation is based on your transact rate."
good,"Very few experienced managers in both vehicle sales, management and lean systems. "
good,"You can make good money, and the training is very good especially if you are new to sales. "
good,"I worked at CarMax for about 5 years. In that time, I was trained to sell cars and ascended to one of the top 3-5 sales people out of 40. I was awarded the yearly Las Vegas trip multiple times and awarded bonuses and recognition. It was good."
good,"Every day went fast, but too many notes in the computer and not enough time to just take with customer.  Low stress job, just not enough volume to make an honest living.  Open 7 days a week."
good,"I was CarMax biggest fan until I had an immediate supervisor change.  Good benefits, workplace culture, peers and associates."
good,"Sales is stressful no matter where you are. The system is good way to sell cars. the managers are good at training, however, they are big micromanagement company."
good,"I don't even want to be writing this review. I really don't care, I just want to skip it, but Indeed wont let me for whatever reason. I was only there for a few months doing commission based sales and needed something with steady pay."
good,This company how to distinct model that had to be withheld amongst management and peers. You could not go outside their model of business. It was hard to advance their however overall working for the company was quite Pleasant
good,other then the managers being rude at times. carmax is a great place to shop for cars i loved working here the environment and people there are incredible they get the job done on time and focus on customer wants and needs i will recommend this place to anyone.
good,Good company to work for at a store that has quite a bit foot traffic.  If at a slower store it's hard to make money.
good,"Unfortunately, my particular location is an appraisal heavy store, meaning many of my customers are only there to see what their car is worth. We have a lot of down time that can only be used for a few limited things. I have learned a bit about sales, but CarMax is geared to be more of a retail store, so some traditional sales techniques are useless or futile here. Management is fairly good overall, just lapses in consistency really hurt their value. The hardest part of my job is spending a long time with a customer or waiting for an opportunity, having that opportunity fall apart, then having to repeat the process all over again with a good attitude. This would be an extremely difficult job were it not for my great coworkers who make every day very enjoyable."
good,The industry brings interesting characters.  Must be prepared for a variety of situations. Fast changing environment. Great model with a focus on individual growth and development.
good,amazing company to work for youll love once you first start but as time goes by you realize how poor  the management executes and how careless they are about their employees. Not all managers but most
good,Had fun at first but my hours changed and they make you answer the phones 3 hrs out of day while you just want to sell cars. Some of the cars i have sold have had issues like the buttons not working. it was pretty embarrassing when a customer tried to use a sun roof and had it not work at all.
good,"very good company to work for and advance in if you are willing to relocate. Sometimes meetings are very repetitive and management can be micro- managers but overall enjoy working there,"
good,"Management could be better, overall though a pretty good place to work."
good,CarMax was a great place to work. You do have to have a strong work ethic and be able to keep up but there is an opportunity for growth. Every department does have a different culture.
good,"Good Place to work, good benefits, but at the end of the day, it's a used car lot. To move up from a Tech position to a manager would require my pay being cut almost in half. I worked overnight and the atmosphere was good. Good people."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Carmax. My biggest issues where the pay  working late nights , and the process to advance. In general, I learned a lot and made lifetime friends."
good,My Manager was great about ensuring I new how to be successful. He continued to follow up with training and monthly projections. Work life balance was a challenge but expected since customers usually wanted to buy cars on weekends.
good,"Work hours as a sales consultant are either 9am-6pm or 12pm-9pm and neither is consistent. You will always get 2 days off per week but neither off days will be consistent it changes every week. You will get 3 day weekend Sat, Sun, and Mon. but thats after 4 weeks of work. You are paid hourly and or commission whichever is higher at the end of the pay period thats what you will get. Customers decide when they want to come in - I use to come in on my days off to close a sale, but it was a waste because customers won't show up and or show up on your days off and end of getting a half-sale (split). Benefits are good, good job if you're okay with settling. Good company but just a stepping stone for me but career for some. To each is own."
good,"It is a good place to work and knowing that everything is clear and ethical. The sales car industry is one of the most difficult industries to achieve what Carmax represents. The process is easy and clear and the customer service previous and after the transaction is just amazing as well as the culture. For me personally the schedule was the down point in terms of balance between family and work, also in order to advance in Carmax you have to be open to relocate and that is not possible when you have a family and both parents are working full time plus school for the kids and everything else that involves in life when you are part of a community."
good,"Not something I would call a career, but not a bad place to work. Full commission though, which is a downside. Long hours as well. It was nice being able to be free and not be micro managed."
good,I can only speak for the department I worked in which was the business office. It's was one of the coolest places to work and I love what I did.  The benefits was great but the PAY was terrible in my department.  Was there for 3 yrs and only made $11.70.  Went through 2 managers and new one brought people in way higher than the people that had been there.  You only got one weekend off a month.  Management was horrible and it took forever to get promoted.
good,"Typical day was coming into work and getting on the ups list so you can see a customer that comes into the front door.  The hardest part was trying to get the customer to buy a vehicle from you.  Most of the vehicles are good and still under warranty from the manufacture but the ones that arent, you try to sell the carmax warranty and that is also a hard sell.   Overall it was a ok place to work.  Too many sales consultants trying to fight for a sale."
good,"I've enjoyed my time at CarMax, but it's becoming less employee focused and becoming more investor focused. It's been a pretty significant paradigm shift."
good,"I think the training and process is too extensive for part-time workers. Most part-time employees only come in for a few hours in the evening and some hours on the weekend, so a lot of the training material would not apply to them, since most transactions happen during the day Monday thru Friday"
good,Company culture was amazing.  Pay and commission structure was terrible.  Management hires too many sales people.  It's not possible to meet necessary goals with that much competition.
good,"This is a very exciting place to work and is great for first time sales people. The people are friendly and the system makes it extremely easy to sell cars. THE PAY STINKS. To make any kind of decent money you need to hustle, HARD."
good,Great place to start but the pay is to low to stay. The managers are willing to train anyone. This means the all kinds of people work here. The benefits are what helped me to stay however the pay is not a livible wage like many jobs. My personal skills were not used in Accounting. I was told that after I worked for them for six months I would be advanced however this never happened.
good,"Carmax is a great place to work. The employees are always helpful, and willing to teach you a different approach  to a situation.  The managers are always there to provide feedback and help you in any possible way"
good,"The buyer position is demanding physically and the schedule can be taxing but it is an amazing opportunity! I loved the job and the people, but in the long run the schedule did not work for me and my family. "
good,"3 years, worked in multiple departments. I found that you are only important and respected within your department. Theres a lot of division within the company. Some managers are managing positions they know nothing about but are expected to help you? Decent temporary place to work, but all depends on who your manager is."
good,"Was fun to finance your own deals, explain the process and the warranty they can choose from for great peace of mind. Management was a quick turnaround and they bullied employees."
good,"A good place to work but must work retail hours. Fun, fast atmosphere.  Upbeat workplace culture enjoyed working there but hours are horrible for family life."
good,"Great place for meticulous person, pay is good , have to ask everyone to verify and confirm what you're doing .music over intercom.everyone is out to blow the whistle on every little thing to get ahead"
good,Good place to work but you could make more doing the same job at another dealership. Some manager jobs are under paid  Great Relocation program!!!
good,"Carmax is a good place to start, especially as a buyer.  They put you through a 10 month training in order to have you prepared to be a successful buyer."
good,"Typical day of work includes several hours of standing, showing vehicles to customers.  Investing in a comfortable pair of shoes is imperative.  Co-workers come from a varied background, where the turn-over rate is high and the 100% commission tends to be strenuous for Sales Consultants with families to care for at home.  The most difficult part of the job is being able to withstand the slow days where you may or may not make any sales.  Customers will call you on your day off (or show up with no call), and you will feel pressure to go back in to work and close a deal, lest your hours of hard work be split with another Sales Consultant.  Life and work balance is difficult.  There is modest money to be made by putting in about 50+ hours a week.  The most enjoyable part is engaging with customers, and helping them make informed decisions regarding their next purchase."
good,"As you know with the car industry, the days can be full of nothing but sitting around on your butt and other days are full of sales. I enjoyed the training and the managers at first. My co-workers are some of the best i've ever had. They are fun to hang-out with and they know how to do their jobs. After being here for a few months however everything is starting to lose the shine it once had. My co-workers are still a joy to be around, but everything else is getting old. The non-stop training is annoying, and they use it as an excuse to micromanage. After they review your performances every month you get the general idea, that no matter how successful you are there is something your doing wrong. "
good,Good place to work; good value on cars; relaxed atmosphere; offer some benefits for PT workers as well as FT
good,It was a great job for someone that was just getting in the business. I have been in the business a long time and need to be challenged. They could not give me that.
good,Carmax is a great place to work as long as you watch you watch your P's and Q's. There can be great opportunities for advancement as long as you keep your head down
good,"I came into the job with no car experience and less than a year of customer service experience. The training in phenomenal, and on going through out your time there. I learned a variety of customer service skills, like taking phone calls, updating notes in a CRM, and guiding clients in a way that makes them feel supported. Workplace culture is generally healthy, and not uncomfortably competitive like other car dealerships."
good,does not pay enough and management was a hit or miss. they did not appreciate how management handled my situation when it came to conflict of interest.
good,"Fun times working at this place, my experience was more so in the beginning then it became a much more tense workplace than what it was at the beginning. Constant movement always having something to do."
good,"Flexible schedule and decent pay, a lot of micromanaging though. Management needs to trust their associates more instead of continuously double checking everything."
good,The only problem I had working at Carmax was being in the heat constant during the summer. Being in the inventory building for a full shift during the summer caused myself to have headaches due to the heat.
good,Personal experience it’s a good starter company not for a beginner trying to move up but learning is easy there i personally wouldn’t go back I’m in the market for a career not a job
good,Formal carmax employee sales. Work for carmax for 13 years enjoyed the benefit in sales rep. My recent for leaving was change of pay planner Work more for less money does not make sense.  Great training great place to learn after 6 months move on to a traditional  Dealership and make double the money. It's a shame the company decided to Cut the pay and sales rep To support another department
good,"Great spot to work at, but this Carmax in Cle is the lowest productive of them all they are looking to turn things around now but you'd want to have another job working here or be here everyday day even on you off days to get what you can to make it through the month. The winter time is going to be tough and you are going to have to be able to weed out all the BSers and work the customers who truly have potential. Overall still had a blast working here and made some life long friends still would recommend plus they are working on getting this location from the bottom to the top currently."
good,I’m a buyers Assistant and the only bad thing is wholesale where you go and take pictures of the back of the lot and those are strictly only the ones we don’t put in front lot
good,"As a part time employee I liked the job, but it seems like its more of a full time job due to customers schedules. I did receive tuition reimbursement."
good,Driving for Carmax was a great experience for me. I love cars and the environment was cool. I got an opportunity to meet people that I'll more than likely associate with for the rest of my life. The whole team at the Lithia Springs store were some of the coolest people I've worked with. The GM goes over and beyond for his team! I appreciate my time with the company.
good,"nice place to work "
good,"Great company to work"
good,fast paced environment and great company to work for. Great hours and benefits given to employees. Great culture to work for and really developing associates
good,A lot of great things about working for CarMax. I enjoyed the emphasis they had on their employees and how they empowered us to do what was right for the customer.
good,The pay is pretty decent overall. I will say if you work in a position that does not have a set schedule (Monday-Friday) you feel as if you have ZERO work/life balance.
good,Good place to work with advancement opportunities. Good pay and vacation days. Very relaxed working environment. I learned a lot about detailing at this job.
good,A corporate company that is always changing with the constant change of technology and ways of doing things. Great company and place to work! Retail schedule but fairly decent starting pay with ways to increase!
good,"There will be times where you love working at CarMax."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Carmax. They treat you very fair there and have a very good company mission. The only negative I can say is the hours can be a little tough as you will be required to work weekends and some nights. Typical retail schedule, but if you are fine with that then this is a great place to start or continue your sales career."
good,Idk it was alright not that great to far low pay. You have to work hard just to make like $30k. Fast months you make like $4k and slow months min wage.
good,"Great benefits, flexible schedule, overall awesome place to work. I would highly recommend this workplace. Referral incentives for new hires, appropriate pay raises, manageable work load. BA is an easy easy job and lots of fun!"
good,"Very lively environment, great people to work with. Normal work day is 8 hours. Learned how to communicate with staff and customers. Managed time wisely. Work Culture was very unique, all different types of people. Hardest part of job was dealing with irate customers. Most enjoyable was driving different cars."
good,"Honestly the only thing that I dislike about this job was the pay. Unlike other dealerships I've worked at (They offer salary and commission) CarMax only offered either a BASE rate of 9.50 an hour OR if your earnings in commission was higher, you would take that home. They also have a system that doesn't allow one sales person to be hungry and get as many sales as possible. If you have two clients stacked up, they only allow you to work with one at a time- and you will have to give your second customer to another associate and split the commission."
good,learned how to servive and help others as a team. also worked in a great enviroment with good pay for a part time job. People were really nice and i enjoyed my stay there.
good,Always had a million things to work on but no time due to being required to also assist clients in the window and answering phones. The pay is not what it should be for the amount of different job roles you do.
good,Loved the friendships I made while working for Carmax. Really a fun environment being around the cool cars all day and noticing just all the similarities and little differences between the makes and years.
good,The hours were long and there was no work life balance for managers. The expectation was the job came first which made it difficult for managers with families.  The hours were long and the requirements made it stresssful.  Carmax is a good company to work for if you are a driven person.
good,"Sales car, contact with customers to help  them"
good,"For someone who loves cars, this is a great job. As a detailer, you get to drive and clean both daily drivers and exotic sports cars. With two fifteen minute breaks and an hour for lunch, there was always enough energy left to complete the job."
good,Sold cars online or in person. I learned how to deal with customers and advertised. The managers were really helpful. Everyone in the company helped to sell cars. There was nothing hard about the job. The whole job was enjoyable.
good,much better from traditional car dealerships for customers and employees.  fast paced and need to stay on your toes to succeed.  will be around in 5 years when other retailers will not.
good,Tto make the money expected it takes over 40 hours per week. The overall working environment is good and CarMax is a very good company but it's very difficult if not impossible to earn the amount of money that is suggested by management.
good,"Employee morale is always up. Everyone works together and collaborates where they can for the success of the company. Open schedule, can work pretty much all hours."
good,"I enjoyed my time at carmax for the most part. Management was always nice and helpful, coworkers were great, and overall it was a pretty relaxed environment. Pay and hours are the only negative."
good,"Carmax LLC is a good company with good people, They take an interest in you as an individual and provide ample training and opportunity for advancement."
good,Get ready to be bugged to sell cars and go against company policy! Most stores have good management but I would not recommend the charlottesville location to anyone! Overall great benefits and 401k and set hours. Hard to get advancements without a fancy college degree.
good,"CarMax is a great place to learn car sales and also how to do appraisals.  However, the earning potential has a ceiling.  Their commission structure is a max, and it's hard to make more than a certain amount of money."
good,"Fortune 100 Company, Best Place to Work"
good,No review. This company was a great company to start your sales experience with. Customer service and communication is a major part in your position no matter what.
good,Carmax was a great place to work. Ton of friendly coworkers and hardly did you run into any customer service issues. Work environment was very relaxed.
good,"Great place to improve on your skills, especially if you are trying to build personal growth. Great stepping stone for anyone looking to advance. The company has many opportunities for advancement."
good,"While as a company Carmax was a good place to work, however being surrounded by untrustworthy people takes a toll."
good,As a sales associate you get great initial training as well as sustained training on a weekly bases. The sales associate does have opportunities to advance.
good,The position was fine.  The only reason that I left Carmax is that we moved out of Austin Texas to Modesto California.  I had some really great times at the job
good,Workplace culture is inviting to a point. Hardest part of the job are the complicated computer programs to learn. The most enjoyable is customer service.
good,Customer service based. Some customers were not so friendly or understanding of things explained. The management was average and at times unprofessional. The overall experience was a positive one.
good,"Solid, growing company nationally. Business model for sales is one of a kind. There is Tons of turnover. Undisciplined and tough sales process to find quality sales people."
good,you had to pay back subsidy if it was needed. no base pay at all. people were cut throat and would lie for sales. has to monitor everything so you got credit
good,The management is great and the only thing that I didn't like was their pay rate. Their sale men are very knowledgeable about what they are doing. I learned from Carmax to always smile even while on the phone. Great place to work at.
good,"Buyers assistant is not a bad job but feels constricted and little room for growth. Good for just out of college but until promoted to middle management, assistant positions seems stifled."
good,Fun place to work as long as Management steps in to resolve issues with associates before they become a bigger problem. No real set time end to your work day. Some days you work 1 1/2 hours pass closing.
good,"Typical day at work can be very vast with customer sales and appraisals being done. I've learned a ton about being part of a team and how every area of work comes together to give the best customer experience. The hardest part of the job are the times that there aren't any customers coming in and there are about twenty consultants on the ups list, but there are always follow up calls you can make with that time."
good,"A typical day for me at Carmax was starting the morning with a meeting for feedback, stats, and any new products arriving or any changes."
good,"the most enjoyable part of this job was working with great co-workers. a typical day would include taking down payments, signing contracts, DMV, take phone calls, call banks, count safe funds, close drawers."
good,Great company and people to work with but corporate doesn't give enough hours to the location I worked at to staff enough people for the amount of work that is required to accomplish by the end of the day.
good,Carmax is a great employer and opportunity for growth. They have flexible schedule and great benefits
good,Things have changed in the last year. Hard to make money now and managers are MICROMANAGING good sales people out of their jobs.
good,If you love cars and working on them then this is the job for you but if you like to move up quickly then dont apply here the pay is decent but if you dont like fast paced.
good,"Carmax has a healthy corporate culture with emphasis on respectful behavior toward all fellow workers, also embraces diversity of employees."
good,"fun work environment, focused on self and career development, management changes a lot,good work hours, healthy place to work, medium stress."
good,"You have the possibility to meet a lot of different people who are coming to sale or buy a car."
good,CarMax is a great company to work for. Day in and day out I was always busy and there was lots of information to learn. Overall I enjoyed my time at CarMax and recommend it to anyone who loves a fast paced enviornment
good,"I loved working at Carmax, best job I've had. The things I didn't like was micro-managing and their is a lot you can get in trouble for."
good,Nice job to meet people from different walks of life. Hardest part of the job was the constant training.  I learned to stay positive with every customer.
good,"Great place to work, but not good for work/life balance. Also the commission system is a flat rate system so you must sell volume in order to make a good living."
good,"Fun retail environment based on customer service and teamwork. My day consisted of managing several aspects of the company's bottom line. I learned a lot about a fortune 500's operations and how to maintain profitability. As a manager, I enjoyed working with the various sections of the day to day operations, as well as developing the associates. the entire staff has a positive attitude and enjoy coming to work. There was no difficult aspects of the position outside of finding harsh information about customers vehicles that would affect its value. I highly enjoyed helping our guests find the right car that fit there needs."
good,The training program is outstanding and ever evolving.  The compensation is adequate and the people are friendly.  The turnover is also very low.
good,"What I learned from working at the company is have patients for everyone. There was nothing hard about the job. I enjoyed the management, they were helpful and not pushy."
good,"Responsible for selling the maximum number of vehicles possible at optimum profit. Also in charge of building relationships with"
good,"Every job has its stress that comes with it. Here there's a pressure free environment.  The managers are not always so hard on you and because its sales, you control your own wages."
good,"Great benefits , employees make the job. Very little chance of moving up the ladder , steady raises and lunches on weekends."
good,"Family environment, good people to work with.  Typical day revolved around providing qualified store traffic and strategies to meet sales goals."
good,"good learning environment, learned about good quality and inventory control."
good,"Great company just wasn't what I was looking for. Weekly meetings, friendly workplace, involved in the community. Co-workers were nice and worked hard. Management was available whenever you needed to speak with them. Very open to discuss any issues."
good,"-  Great environment"
good,"CarMax Auto Finance is a great company. The benefits are decent, the people are very nice and the pay is somewhat ok. The only issue is that the culture has tremendously changed under new leadership and the value that used to be placed in the people has diminished. Otherwise it is a good company. I wish leaders would go back to truly caring about the people."
good,"CarMax's way of business is proven to be a great model.  Increasingly touch to live with full-time commission only compensation though with sales.  "
good,"If you are in sales and you don't sell cars, you don't make any money"
good,"Values are the foundation for CarMax operations, and through them we seek to treat everyone—customers, Associates, and investors—with the same level of trustworthiness and ethical practices. We merged the best practices of retail with the automotive industry, building a solid platform that is fair and equitable."
good,Great training program. Long hours including weekends. Very team-oriented. Seasonal job.
good,"	Uses interpersonal skills with customers and fellow associated to facilitate vehicle purchases. Daily activities included describing what makes Car Max unique. "
good,"Team meeting with immediate manager. Meet with associates that I manage. Manage several accounts and allocate assignments accordingly. Meet and greet customers. Manage repairs to each vehicle. Communicate with outside and internal vendors to provide consist business opportunity Provide feedback to employees for associate development and improvement Organize time slots to keep clients informed on a regular basis. Follow up with customers on previous service experience. Hardest part of the job is making sure every customers gets the full load of what service has to offer. Most enjoyable part of working in this position is the constant communication with co-workers and management, and being able to assist in anyway possible."
good,it was very rewarding. I enjoyed working for CarMax very much. I am being helped a lot to become the best in my field.
good,"CarMax was a wonderful place to work. I know that when working, you create a work family, meeting such wonderful people and being apart of that was the best thing."
good,Great place to work when sales are up.  Commission base is minimum wage.  Expected to sell 10 vehicles a month.  You are scheduled no more than 40 hours a week but will work 40+ hours in a slow market and may not make 10 vehicles a month
good,"You can make a very good living but at a price.  "
good,"Fast paced, associate driven, retail environment. Fast growing and competitive."
good,I enjoyed the new tasks and overall challenge of the job. The company is growing and it was great to be part of it.
good,"CarMax is an excellent company to work for, especially as a non manager, non salaried employee. There is decently good training provided at these levels, but they fail to continue the training for managers. There is little to no work/life balance as a manger, and you can expect to work upwards of 60 hours per week including the occasional weekend (department dependent)."
good,Enjoyed the people and environment. I loved having the ability to interact with people daily.
good,"Busy work environment makes shifts go by fast. Emphasis on development of employees through training, and encouragement to stay with company."
good,"At CarMax you will work with great people that are on your level. For the Managers, some are great and a lot of them are not. Because Sales Consultants only get paid on commission and Managers have a salary they don't seem to comprehend how hard it is to sell a car. They will sit you down, go over your numbers and give you tips on things that they have never applied themselves. You can however make a good amount of money, but you have to be the their 24/7 to do so."
good,I was a supervisor there for 2 years. Great fortune 500 company to work for.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me detailing vehicles interior/exterior. I learned a lot about vehicles inside and out. The management there was actually the bes I've ever had I cant't really complain. My co-workers very friendly and helpful, the hardest part of my job was when a vehicle was very dirty and it took me a long time to complete it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the time me and my employees spent together."
good,a fun place to work. Management was very good and understanding.
good,When they say they are different from other dealerships they are definitely correct. The whole process is totally different that what most people expect.
good,Carmax is an amazing company to work for with competitive pay and opportunities. The experience there was a great one. They train you and show a lot of new skills you can use in your everyday life
good,Car sales: CarMax is a great place to work where the managers are supportive and co-workers are team players. I recommended this career path to anyone seeking a challenge in life.
good,"Carmax is a sales Job in a retail style environment. This means there is not a graduated tier of pay the better you do, or the more expensive units you sell. If you are coming from other retail jobs and are comfortable with the unexpected nature of sales and pay format then it is a good job. However if you are looking for a sales job (Carmax is strictly commission, no base salary) with high commissions then another dealership might be a better option."
good,Make your own schedule once you obtain presidents club. Free trip to Vegas once accomplished. Micro managing can tone down a bit but overall great place to work.
good,"I worked at Carmax in the sales department for a year. I learned many valuable things since the job was so multifaceted. Unique to Carmax, sales associates typically handle their customers from the greeting to the signing. We are trained to help the customers find the perfect car for them based on their budget, features and overall need. You have a rotation of different sales managers to help aid you in approving documents, financing and flow of business. I enjoyed the people I worked with since everybody was so different. There were people that had been working there for 10+ years which is always a good sign of a great company. One of the tougher parts of the job involves you always being alert to possible fraud. You have to constantly be on top of policies  and regulations to ensure the best customer experiences. You have to be willing to deliver hard news to people but be kind and direct in your delivery. The best part of the job was helping people from all financial backgrounds find their perfect car."
good,Good people and really take good care of you. Management varies from store to store and customers will always get their way here. So be ready to bend on policies at any given time on a case by case basis.
good,"Carmax use to be a really good company and fun place to work.  Now Sales Consultants are like cheap laborers!"
good,"I learned a lot which was my goal to be a better manager. I am a much better manager from learning how to be a sales person.  Worked for management that was different, that also helped."
good,Excellent until I was promoted to service manager after being a line production manager in Sacramento. The service manager position is grueling labor intensive stressful exhausting and lacking in all support. Myself as well as three other service managers in the region quit or were terminated within a year. Amazing company if your an hourly associate though.
good,Typical day is 9 hours with 1 hour lunch break. Management is strict and focuses very heavily on personal development which can result in 3-8 hours of meetings per week Development meetings take you away from customers and restricts your ability to make sales. The hardest part of the job is customers treating you like a used cars salesperson. Most enjoyable part is making $2000+ paycheck when it happens. Most people quit after a year and either get out of sales or go to a real dealership. There is minimal room for promotion. Top earning sales consultants will make more than sales managers.
good,"Way too PC, they embrace the 1% at the expense of the mainstream. It was very hard not to offend someone somehow. Managers were hypocrites about this policy"
good,Productive and fun work environment. You get to work along side individuals and closely with consumers to help meet their car shopping needs. Low pressure sales.
good,Overall good place to work alot of paper work to learn you handle it all from greeting the customer to getting them financed. Car preparation. The good thing about that is the customer doesn't get handed off to 3 different people. So when they leave they did business with you and will refer you at Carmax not just Carmax. (Medium stress level)
good,Interaction with people was nice. It has a nice training program and really focuses on ways to sell cars without trying to pressure anyone.  It is a good place to work.
good,"Carmax is a good place to get your foot in the door to learn about cars and gain people skills and so much more, but the management is bad and job can be extremely stressful.Not a place I'll recommend for anyone over 30-35 years old can make a living just be ready to work long hours and not to see your family or kids for possibly a few days because making a sale is much more important to the managers."
good,"A typical day depending on your shift is pretty much the same, you start your morning by greeting office staff and once you greet your fellow employees, you head out to meet customers and make it your duty to provide them with the greatest customer experience ever."
good,Nice place to work with training around every corner. Good work life balance and discounts. Paperless culture with a very clean work flow process in each department.
good,"Fast paced, but still fun. Challenging place to work. Dealt with a lot of different cars both on and off the CarMax lot. Management was good, not great but would work with you if you have a problem."
good,"When I first started I had awesome managers. Over time, however, that changed. Before I left the managers I had played clear favorites and opportunities I was previously spoken to about where no longer planned for me. I appreciated the experience overall and learned a lot."
good,"I feel as a sales consultant at Carmax we are micromanaged. Managers are not always on the same page, meaning one manager will tell you to do something a certain way while another will tell you the opposite."
good,"Days are always busy, you'll always have something to do during your shift. You are also able to change positions within the company. Management can use some work in all departments, some take advantage of their roles. The culture is very diverse and everyone is very friendly and helpful for the most part."
good,"This job was a great place to work. Very flexible. There were a few issues among st workers but never interfered with the work load or adhering to customers. I received alot of experience with dealing/handling money, which is something that I have never done."
good,It was an okay place to work. The management is average. They have high turn-over of employees. A good business model. They sell variety of vehicles. It is a no-haggle sales policy. When I started there in 2004 the management was excellent but changed tremendously later.
good,"Great place to work, management not so great .Purchasing department is okay . Use to be great now its just okay because of the changes they have been making ."
good,Pretty decent place to work needs better pay to match cost of living rates in the area. There are a lot of fun activities to participate in outside of work as a group.
good,Great opportunity to train and learn new skills. I was hired with no experience. Underpaid compared to every other competitor in the automotive market.
good,"CarMax is always about constant ""touch bases"" with associates. You almost always feel like you're doing something wrong. While constructive criticism is helpful, it's a little excessive at CarMax."
good,CarMax is a very structured company with no flexibility. There policy's are designed to work in all states the company operated in instead of the state the customer is purchasing in. This creates a need to require documentation that most local businesses do not require. If you like  structured environment this is the company for you.
good,"great culture with upbeat atmosphere. However, the management is over bearing and demanding (micromanagement at its best) If you work here be prepared to receive plenty of ""feedback""."
good,"Extensive training, friendly work culture and management, very low pay. Hours are traditional dealership hours: evening and Saturdays. Hour lunch....."
good,This job worked around my school schedule. It's a gear job while your younger but can take a toll on you after a while Because you work out doors and constantly moving around.
good,Training process is very well thought out and I was able to learn so much. They are very accommodating and organized. Work events and activities were always fun and the free food was great. It just went downhill for me when we got new management.
good,I enjoyed my time at Carmax and learned so many things.  Their methods are proven and quantity of customers is strong.  
good,"Loved, Simply enjoyed working at Carmax Auto Superstore. The Service Dept. was just a big family... Although the pay was not suitable to live, I sometimes wish I was still there.. I was there a long time."
good,"Depending on the department you work in this is a great workplace for anyone who is looking to be a contributor to the company. There is room for growth but only if the applicant is willing to expand their availability. In other departments there seems to not be too much room for growth due to other associates that have been there longer and seem to be more qualified and looking for advancement as well. However if you are willing to relocate, there are methods to achieve the desired management role. There are also times when management opinions rule over company standards and its usually at the expense of the employee. The workplace culture is mostly good, there are always someone there to motivate you and help you advance your skills set in every department, very few bias attitudes and many ways to correct them."
good,"Great place to start your career and make some decent money while you are improving your skills and experience in customer service, value building, meeting new people, client management. You have to move for career advancement, which was the reason for my departure."
good,"Old school working environment.  Excellent organization structure, vision, strategy, mission and goals.  Company uses a 5-year continuously evolving Roadmap to improve capabilities every year throughout the company.  Awesome!"
good,Carmax is set up to make life easier for the consultant to work with the customer and you can make as much as you want but you have to remember just like a traditional dealer not every customer will buy a car. With that said you just have to put in the work by keeping up with your follow-ups and have a core group of reliable associates you trust in order to make money during the times you aren't available or aren't at work.
good,Carmax is a great place to work. They have good pay and benefits. They do a decent job to take care of employees. They actually treat you like a human being. The only negative is that it’s a garage type atmosphere with the rules of a big corporation.
good,"Great benefits. Even though it's advertised as a transparent company, managers lack motivation to actually change anything even with multiple complains from different employees and often shun out any criticism."
good,"I enjoyed the Company (Carmax) but, the managers would praise you and even use you as a good example when your sales were up. However, when you had a bad sales month, they would try to retrain you or even embarrass you. I liked working at Carmax but, did not enjoy the Sales position. You work long hours, over what you are scheduled, to try to make sales. The sales managers only recognize number of units sold, not the time you put in to the job. I would have preferred working in Service or another department."
good,"come in check cars on hold and notes, check appointments, follow up with passed customers, get on list to greet new customers try to buy or sell something."
good,"No matter what department you are in, you will be busy. You must be willing to work as a team and have great patience. I learned a lot about myself and how to handle customers and many different personalities while I worked at CarMax. Beware of politics and follow the rules or you will get fired. The hardest part of the job is some days you will feel like you are working harder than everyone else and there is nothing you can do about. Best part... free food, prizes, awards and recognition if you've performed well."
good,"if your good at sales pay is good, otherwise career advancement is not the best. They typically hire outside of the company for management positions.."
good,Good place to work if you are looking for a competitive and high paced environment. You meet many people and learn a lot about selling behaviors and financing
good,Overall great place. Pros and cons like most employers. Would not hesitate to return. Job was not difficult but there was no chance to be promoted to higher positions
good,"It isn't a very different atmosphere than any other dealership I worked at. If you can wade through what seems like endless appraisals, that are mostly a waste of time, you can bring home a solid paycheck. You will need to sell extended service plans in order to do so, not just cars."
good,"If you're new to benefits and company policies I would recommend  carmax. I was in inventory and reconditioned cars, so my day was never complete. You have to be responsible for every single car on the property owned by carmax. My particular manager didnt have it all together and was poor at communication, but the other departments had some pretty cool ones. The workplace was genuinely relaxed because most of the people who work there have an interest in cars and loved their job. The hardest part of the job where the ones that didnt want to do it, and you'll often have to pick up the slack. People take advantage of the company's forgiving policies. The most enjoyable parts where watching happy customers leave with a good deal."
good,"Carmax is currently at a point where they are cutting costs. They are adding responsibilities but distributing them to less people. They have a lot of really caring managers, but even more micromanagers that try to squeeze every drop they can from you without expecting the same type of work from themselves. It can be very stressful if you work at a high volume store. There are a lot of figure heads who just talk but don't know what they are doing. Additionally, a lot of these managers get to drive the cars for a period of time for free and they spend a lot of time just looking for their monthly car instead of working. It gives off the appearance that they are of a higher class than the regular workers."
good,Great place for students to work for..hard to work as a full time job for the pay expect to work long hours to make a decent living. Has a high employee turnover rate
good,"Car Max is  a great company to work for. A typical day begins normally assessing your follow ups or customer contacts from the previous day. Which includes emailing, calling and going through messages. Then, proceed to the point to greet customer. The day's progression is determined by the flow of customers. Family friendly environment very structured.The hardest part of the job is you have no control over your pay and the flow of customers coming in the store. The most enjoyable would be your pay and the customer's delight when you help them find the perfect car."
good,"It's a good company to work for, they have a strong work/life balance.  Sales can be a challenge though, you are always worrying about your monthly numbers"
good,"Great place to work. Great management. I was always treated fairly by everyone, all departments communicated and worked together efficiently. Work flow was optimal."
good,"Work like it is your personal business but CarMax is your franchises. If you do not adhere to their rules to the fullest, they have no problem releasing you from employment no matter your rank or how much money you have made for them. This is coming from someone who has moved an average of more than $14,760,000.00 of inventory for them."
good,"Learned what they do to approve a vehicle for sale. Inventory is the last people to check a car before it is able to be sold. If it does not pass the checklist, it is sent back to the person who did not complete their job. After lunch you scan and account for every car in the system that is assigned to the dealership. All of them. It takes a good 5 hours to do that. Have a 4 day 10 hour work week, so Fridays off and do not start again until 7 pm Monday."
good,"Commission based for Sales Associates. I found it stressful, because one week you could be great and the next nothing. Don't like being pushy or overwhelming."
good,Excellent job for someone to kick off a carrer. This is an entry level position and requires little to no experience. If your looking to get into the automotive field this could be the job for you.
good,"I worked there 3 years, Managers only care about themselves, If you wanted to move up as a white sales manager expect to jump through every hoop known to man! I would recommend working there just for the training. If you wanted to move up in the company just start as a sales manager it seems it is much easier."
good,very good experience for customers.  I will probably buy cars there every time.  However the customer facing staff are mostly underpaid for the work they do.
good,"Fun workplace in a retail setting for selling cars. Middle management is arrogant. Good upper management. Great coworkers but some are selfish about commission. High stress, low reward."
good,"This job is great for someone who loves cars and wants to continue to learn about them. This position is outside all day, in all of the elements so that is something to keep in mind. The management is nice however there are no signs of advancement, many employees have been here for 2 or more years and have remained stagnant. Hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with the ever changing Georgia weather. Thunderstorms, Extreme Heat, or Frigid mornings. Being a part of the On-Site Auctions and the cars we purchase has to be the most enjoyable part of the job, from rare foreign cars, to fully built muscle cars and all of those in-between."
good,"The benefits are great for full timers however being part time meant NO hours above 25, pretty much no benefits at all. I was considered for full time, and last minute they chose someone who didn't even apply for it (in the store) so that sucked. Now I am trying to pay bills working 25 hours a week which is really tough."
good,"People are friendly and they always find the way to satisfy business needs, I had to work with different work streams creating a good partnership to get the project and task completed."
good,"Carmax Auto Finance is a great company to work for. As long as you follow the rules and do your job, you can have a career. Moving up can be tedious and daunting. The culture is great but the benefits such as health insurance are high for a large company."
good,"morning meetings every morning can become redundant...not a stressful job...extremely corporate they document everything..mandated training for new sales people is way too long,micro managed up the you know what, flat rate commission means your income will be steady but will be low compared to other deals. Ex: you sell a Porsche 911 at Carmax you make $150 sell the max care insurance that's another $100...If almost any other dealer sold a Porsche 911 that salesperson would make at the minimum $900 off the front end simply from markup that Porsche's carry will be even more if it's cpo, could be anywhere  from $900-$3500"
good,CarMax provides training for it's employees and the benefits are good. However there is a lot of overtime required just to maintain a decent sale rate.
good,"Being able to work with different people either as customer or as coworker. Learned how to communicate properly and how to set goals and meet the set goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I would sell a car and get good reviews from the customer and their point of view. Being able to team-up with my coworkers to meet the deadlines. Meaning if I had two customers at the same time I could partner up with a coworker and pass one customer to him and still be able to keep half of the deal. "
good,CarMax does not have a good Job Work/Life Balance.  The compensation is fair.  Job security is very high.  Working together to reach our daily goal helps you to realize you are part of something bigger than yourself.
good,"Carmax was a great company that focused on its associates and their well being and work life balance, Although its still a great company to work for, would love to see them return to the associate focus,"
good,"Straight commission sales...it is what it is! Some pay periods are better than others, you get out what you put in. Training is great but can be redundant at times. Co-workers are pretty cool but like anywhere else, you have to keep a close eye on one or two. Its a 40 hour work week with sundays off, but you almost need to work open to close the rest of the week to make good money. My location manager was awesome, but the Sales Managers...not so much. Its such a rigorous process to become a manager, but they are missing ""something"" when they promote and/or hire for the sales manager role. Frequent cookouts and employee lunches, decent recognition for a job well done, but if you have a bad pay period or two...you feel it!"
good,its a good place to work nice people management listen to what you have to  say time off when you need there is room to grow within the company
good,"An average day in the purchasing department is appraising customers cars, dealing with the whole sale auction arbitrations, and optioning cars making sure that each car is optioned with the correct equipment so the price is accurate to the customer. Co workers are friendly. Management is nice, but i am looking to move up and Carmax has shown me little hope for growth."
good,"I enjoyed working for Carmax. My co-workers were friendly and very diverse. I enjoyed meeting new customers everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with so many different customers everyday. Each day the circumstances would be different so each day was very refreshing. The Managers did not micromanage you. You could make as muchmoneyas you wanted depending on how many hours you wanted to work. It was a very fun environment to work in. One of the hardest parts of the job was having to come in alot on your day off if your customers just happen to show up, if not you had to split your commission. "
good,"CarMax was a fun place to work, they have a great culture, great employees , the compensation is good as long as you work hard and stay focused, I have gained a lot of experience there in managing people an myself."
good,"if you embrace your training you can make reasonable money here, the culture is great and the benefits are awesome, however in car sales you will see slow months which is not great."
good,"Fun work place with caring associates, Management needs improvement. "
good,"Friendly and productive environment. Leadership, Teamwork and motivational and competitive environment. Love fun and exciting environment."
good,"CarMax is a fun place to work at. The people are the best part about the job, and the team environment is what has kept me there for so long. Depending on the department you work in, there is plenty of upward mobility if you know how to self-promote yourself."
good,Carmax is a great place to work. I enjoy helping customers with their car buying experience. I have learned the pros and cons to buying a car. The management team is very open door and makes it easy to address concerns. The co workers are challenging  The hours are very long. I enjoy the repetitive day to day sales experience.
good,"I would have to give Carmax an overall rating of 4 out of 5 stars. The business has a great structured approach to training its associates. The only downfall is that the only way to increase your income is by moving into a different position within the company, no yearly raises are offered."
good,I worked at CarMax for almost 5 years. The environment was fun and we did lots of training. The great thing was CarMax's no haggle policy which made it easy for us to work with customers.
good,Typical work day consisted of daily meeting/ pep talk. Work is usually slow on retail side. Team is easy to work with and eager to lend specific advise about manufacture based concerns. Knowledge of all type of manufactures learned. Nothing about job is difficult.
good,I meet a lot of interesting people since I've worked here. the hardest part of the job is being out in the elements  year round
good,"Busy days"
good,good but not enough hrs. I enjoy working at CarMax but I cant seem to make enough hrs at work and I also have never flagged before so I guess that could be the problem but I just need to find something else.
good,CarMax is all about team work and is committed for excellence.
good,this job is a entry level job that is pretty easy. not really much to do but you must enjoy working outside. there are so many co workers that its hard to keep track.
good,"Carmax is a fantastic place to work for those who can handle the grind of commission sales. The flexible hours allows for family time, and anyone can make a good living."
good,I got along really well with managers and other employees. I would highly recommend this company to other job seekers.
good,they care more about shareholder than employees . The commission structure is antiquated.  Sales Consultants are paid way less than the industry standard
good,"Great job culture and work atmosphere. Compensation overall could be better. 100% Commission, so basically not for everyone. The training is world class."
good,I enjoyed wy time at Carmax. Their cookie cutter approach to sales may not be the best for an experienced salesman. I did get a very good overall grasp of vehicle sales and purchasing from the experience
good,"Very busy work day.  Friendly people to work with and customers are good.  Good job but you need to work many hours to make ends meet. paper work is the hardest part, but necessary."
good,"Good company with a good culture. I have been there almost ten years and had some experiences with bad management. Those people did not last long. I am currently seeking employment because my only options for career advancement are to wait a number of years for a supervisory position to open up, or to relocate. I would rather have a management job sooner than later and not have to move."
good,I enjoyed working for CarMax it was just some of the employees were just out of hand  sometimes but overall CarMax is a great company I learned a lot at Carmax and there were people there including myself that went above and beyond
good,CarMax is a great place to start a career in Sales with advancement opportunities. I would not work in the automobile industry anywhere else. The culture is great.
good,Its a great first job to get your feet wet in the professional world. The culture and benefits are incredible and they are eager to teach. the only problem is pay. It is fair but low. Also a huge positive to have every Sunday off compared to most retail environments.
good,I learned a lot and was promoted twice during my tenure.  I had an opportunity to learn new skills and advance my abilities.  I was able to join other project teams and meet new people throughout the organization which was beneficial to learning and achieving my career goals.
good,"Great place to work with benefits. "
good,"Understands automobiles by studying characteristics, capabilities, and features; comparing and contrasting competitive models; inspecting automobiles."
good,"Working commission only can be an emotional rollercoaster. But it is fair compensation and you are provided lots of opportunities.  Some managers are clueless, but overall it is pretty laid back."
good,"Worked with my school schedule for the most part. CarMax has great opportunities for students and tuition reimbursement. Towards the end, management wanted copies of students' school schedules to show proof. However, I viewed that as an invasion of privacy.  They just wanted to schedule students the most that they could, because of lack of staff."
good,"Great work environment and culture. Management isn't always great, depends on each individual manager. Easy to advance but it is easy to run afoul of rules that can get you fired."
good,"Very good place to work. Unfortunately for me, my advancement in the company wasn't there. If you know someone in a higher position, that will help you advance quicker. Disappointed only with that aspect"
good,"Company of very decent human beings, however, sometimes the job does take its toll on you. Work life follows you home. Commissions rate could be much higher given the amount of effort expected to close sales, and being the face of the company."
good,"My first 9 months were actually fun and my sales were good, then I got a new sales manager and everything went sour to the point I did not like going to work."
good,Overall Carmax is a decent company to work for but the management can be inconsistent and frustrating.   Most of the management team there is very good but the ones that are not will tear you down.
good,Carmax is a large family style sales approach. They have you work with a mentor to ensure you are prepared prior to taking the sales floor alone. Their pay structure could use an update.
good,"Great place to work, especially in sales. The sky is the limit if you are a motivated person with great communication skills.  I would recommend this place to a friend for sure."
good,The company provides coaching and development for associates so they may have the opportunity for advancement. Great Mission Statement and Values. The pace is steady to swift most of the time.
good,"If you like Car Sales, this is a great place since its non negotiable.  Do not have to deal with people trying to negotiate.  Have to help customers narrow down there car search and help them gain your trust."
good,Good place to work as long as you can handle continuous exposure to the weather. Job involves a great deal of walking so layering of clothes is necessary
good,"Carmax used to an awesome place to come in and work. The company changed their outlook on the purchasing department by not having as many buyers. Some were layed off, most others have left because of management or the staffing has gotten to the point where they feel overwhelmed with things to do. You can just sense that the department as a whole is not in a great mood most days"
good,"I left because most people there are young and lack job place discipline.  Most of the leads were great, department management was 50/50. There was a large turn over rate during the time of my employment, hopefully they got it sorted out by now."
good,"The managers would leave you alone if they saw that you used your time productively. Managers focused on the people who were under performing. The training was great, no issues with that."
good,"An overall great place to work. Full time availability, regular schedule, and hour lunch breaks. They care about your well being overall, and you even get possible bonuses every 6 months."
good,CarMax is filled with great people. They all are willing and actively looking to help you grow and develop as a person. There were some internal politics that I was not the greatest fan of however upon reflection my experience was generally positive.
good,"great place to start your car business career, but you will find quickly the compensation is almost less than half then your ""traditional"" dealers and you will quickly look to move to somewhere else in order to make more money"
good,"Highly recommended for college students. The company culture and people who work there are great. They're super flexible with your life scedule. Unfortunately, most of the management has been in position for 10+ years. Their voices are stale and they have overstayed their welcome."
good,Long days and tough work. Co workers made the job fun. Upper management did not manage the processes just managed to a metrix number. Would work there again under different team.
good,It was a fun place to work and very rewarding when I was able to get a vehicle loan for the customer. The training also helps you ask the right questions in order to find the vehicle that fits the customer's needs.
good,"Overall the business model and the mission is sound enough for growth opportunities.  The potential of development, personal and career, are provided with no strings attached.  The company does do its best to make its employees feel as if they are essential for its success."
good,Team work means everything. Bonuses were cut way back and after traveling over an hour both ways it was hardly worth working there anymore. If bonuses were still good and I didn't live soo far away I would still be there.
good,You work 8 hours a day with an hour lunch. The mangers micromanage and hate to see you have down time. You do majority of the work and the pay does not reflected that.
good,Management was always lacking on authority and at times we too involved with the employees personal situations which would take time out of the days for multiple one on one meetings that were highly unnecessary.
good,"Good sense of community, thorough training.  The hours are hard for family/parents as it changes from day to day, week to week. Good benefits and strong sense of integrity."
good,I've learned how to lead a team. I have the ability to identify opportunity and create action plans to overcome them while delivering an exceptional customer experience.
good,"Great associates, co-workers. Management is understanding and good people to talk to. Work is fair and pay was good. From the start to the end you keep learning and its the beat thing you can get from a job, knowledge."
good,"It is a commission sales job, you get out what you put in. The hours will change week to week but as you reach higher levels you can start to set your own schedule."
good,"Typical day in the purchasing department includes doing appraisals, talking with customers, working with all other departments.   Optioning and assessing vehicles. Researching vehicle values."
good,"Great job for coming out of high school/college. Sometimes able to work with time off. Lots of food/snacks (most people gain weight). Good job for a short time but hours change ever day from 6am-11pm. Not good for family life, but good for transition job."
good,Great place to work. Atmosphere can be a little hectic at times but as long as you meet goals it all works out. Managers are nice and helpful but can be stressful due to pressure coming down on them from senior managment
good,"CarMax was a great place to work and I was a long time associate.  As the company grew there was a noticeable shift in the culture, and ""do more with less"" seemed to be the theme.  I would not consider going back in a management role, but overall the company treats their associates well."
good,Great work environment with awesome staff to work around which made it easy to work as a team and make great money! They treat employees great with buying food and company incentives that show the company appreciates you.
good,Good to great culture. Plenty of leads. Compensation not consummate with workload and revenues generated for the company. Should be more competitive in that regard.
good,"This was a used-car dealership which stressed the necessity of interpersonal communication with each customer. Another interesting factor to the culture at CarMax was the lack of incentives per car sell- instead of a normal percentage based commission only, this commission was set at $150 per car plus bonuses for features added, coupled with a minimum wage. Ultimately this system forces an associate to strive harder to sell, without pressuring the customer."
good,The company is fantastic but just like any job that has a manager that micromanages only it makes it hard. Still a great company through and through. It’s honestly like a family.
good,The management is horrible but overall it is a good place to work with the benefits and fun things to do with the company and not to mention discount of cars.
good,I enjoyed my time and experience working at Carmax.  I learned things from a retail experience that I never had before.  It taught me to adjust and rethink my training in the healthcare field.
good,Work hard and get paid what you are worth.   Sometimes alot of fun and great people to work with.  Management sometimes does not care what is important to the employee.
good,"Typical day was occupied with doing appraisals and working on your Area Of Responsibility. Some AOR's required more time than others. I learned how to properly assess vehicles and be able to see where damage or repairs were done. Management was very laid back until something was brought to their attention by upper management or corporate. whatever it is suddenly becomes the most important thing you do for two weeks and then it is back to normal. they are big on ""getting your back"", but it is only if it helps them out. manager tries to be your friend but is just interested in getting you to give him a good rating when we do an annual survey. Purchasing manager is the biggest phony of all."
good,"Great place- low traffic flow results in unpredictable salary"
good,"Overall enjoyable work place. Good benefits and perks. Some good management, some terrible. Some good employees, some not so great. Just like any other work environment, you just have to focus on the job."
good,Good people. Good work environment.  Terrible hours. Different schedule daily. Low pay. Can start as early as 9:30 if opening and as stay as late as 10:30 if closing. Hate having to work nights and weekends. No time to take care of personal matters. Not much else to say.
good,"You need to be flexible and customer service oriented.  The hours aren't great but the job can offer variety and a chance to advance and grow. If you enjoy retail, you'll enjoy Carmax."
good,It was a good work environment. I liked my peers and wanted to do a good job for the company. We were there before and after the technicians came and left.
good,I really enjoyed working at CarMax.  It was a fun place to work and a place that promoted advancement.  I learned a lot and am truly grateful for the opportunity.
good,"Days were 6am to 6pm for me, went buy pretty fast, so many things going on, from cars being delivered to cars being shipped out, to whole sale cars being shipped out. Checking twice daily to insure that all vehicles are accounted for. Service drive, service writers and service customer. To walking down to the Tech bays and making sure the techs had approvals that the needed. To making sure that the cars that were sold were detailed and ready for the customer to take delivery of them. 100 mph all day but was fun at the same time."
good,"Sometimes you feel the pressure of the sales floor, but honestly it was probably the most relaxed sales job. California CarMax locations actually secure you at $15 an hour, however every other state is commission only. But you have a balance of customers, unlike other dealerships. They give you support and training. of course that can vary from store to store. But core values of carmax require training and development plans to improve"
good,"good place to work, company seems to care about its employees. departments don't seem to work cohesively. company needs to listen to its employees to solve simple problems"
good,"Good Company to work for. Really good place to work for if you are a young mechanic looking for experience and training.  Overall, good management, job culture, and compensation/benefits."
good,"great place i was here for a year loved my coworks and management team. however i was passed over for a promotion several times because i ""wasnt ready"". however i was asked to train the new hires for the posistion i thought i deserved."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced during the busy seasons and can be very slow during off-peak times, mostly summer hours in Louisiana. "
good,"Excellent training and mentoring program and continuos training to make all associates better at their position. Great recognition for all associates that go above and beyond their job requirements. Very good medical benefits and 401K and stock purchase program.   Very good open door program with all management and opportunities for up ward promotions and job transfers. Very good employee discounts on vehicle purchase and service work and parts. Most of the sales managers are team players, but there is definitely favoritism played out on the sales floor. Plus the management politics amongst the management team effects the sales team attitude."
good,CarMax has great ideas and incentives. They lack on their follow through at the store the level. Each store operates however it wants to within a large margin.
good,"If you are sales driven and can sell a lot of cars this may be the job for you.  The car buying experience here is great and they have a great product.  Commission is a flat rate so you can sell any car for the same no matter the price and same for add-ons such as the extended warranties.  However, the commission is not very high you would have to sell a lot of cars in a month to get better than the base salary that you have to pay back with commissions."
good,"Typical day was on the UPS list waiting your turn to take a customer, greeting, leading customer thru the sales process, giving them what they want in their next vehicle and showing them the benefits of the vehicle and shopping with CarMax."
good,"always something new to do everyday, fast pace and up beat job, great coworkers. "
good,CarMax has a great foundation and steady growth. At times they may need some help with management but overall it was a pleasant experience.I would definitely recommend them as a starting position.
good,"CarMax Auto Finance is a good company for college students that have just graduated from college, and want to learn more about how the professional environment is within a large organization. There is a lot of room for growth and development. The company really invest a lot of money into their culture."
good,Good training and great benefits. Commission only and sometimes the policies hinder the ability to sell cars but they do treat their employees well and give opportunities to move up.
good,Carmax is a good company to work for and they offer their associates a lot different benefits. They also offer their associates 401k plans. Carmax has been going through multiple management changes in all departments.
good,Easy way to make a decent income but you get out what you put in being that it is a commission position.  Can require going in on your days off.
good,"The Buyers Assistant helps out in the Buyers Office. My daily duties include changing price stickers, taking pictures for the website, doing vehicle confirmation/walkaround, and securing purchased cars. The work is easy but is very repetitive.There is no to little growth in this position; does not guarantee you will become a buyer which sucks but I understand why. "
good,"If you want a stress free sales job, this is it. Once you start selling and sell enough, you can make your own schedule and get a yearly trip to Vegas."
good,"CarMax is a great company, very diverse atmosphere, and training program. Working in the service Dept is very High Paced and Demanding. Lots and Lots of hours , but the upside it they are very flexible with giving you time off."
good,"Lots of learning opportunity, co worker's are very friendly and helpful when needed. There is room to grow with the company."
good,"Great place to work if you are driven to excel.  Management is very helpful and pushes you to become better every day.  The continuous sales training is very helpful, and the real-time updates of productivity goals is very motivational."
good,"CarMax is a great company with fun, loving, and caring associates. The only downside with the company is the lack of enthusiasm to promote associates. The company has plenty of management positions, yet there is very little effort to help the associates advance up the corporate ladder."
good,"CarMax does not offer high commission rates per unit, but CarMax does offer a sales consultant lots of traffic, lots of high quality inventory, and an opportunity to make a decent living.  CarMax asks that you are completely honest in an interview, be drug free, and be able to demonstrate how you sell in the first interview.  CarMax does not haggle with prices and does not bend on policies.  A sales person needs to offer world class customer service.  It is that plain and simple."
good,"Very face paced work environment. Learned something new everyday. Company was great about training as well as rewarding employees. Managers were in and out, but company was great to work for."
good,"The sales training at Carmax was specific to the dealership. The sale techniques can be used in several situations. The management was positive even when your sales were not meeting the expectations. There was a continuos motivation to becoming more effective with the sales process, that it was only a matter of time before you would be proficient. It was difficult to work every weekend when you knew you had to be there to make sales but you would also miss out on family events. The compensation could be a little better. It hasn't increased in years and not staying with inflation rates but the work environment is upbeat and sales staff was supportive to each other."
good,"Under limited supervision; responsible for providing customer service and helping to meet individual and store sale goals.Sell vehicles by providing customer service by listening and responding to customer needs, assisting with vehicle selection and answering questions."
good,"Great company to work for! Had a good experience with fantastic team members, but realized it was my time to move on."
good,"CarMax is absolutely a growing company with many opportunities for growth and relocation. A typical day at work is fast paced, dealing with customers concerns and making their experience exciting."
good,Working there was fun for a while. Being a sales consultant is hard because of the inconsistency of the pay. As a business office associate it was a lot of work for little pay. The people who work there are wonderful and great to work with.
good,"This may have been one of the best employees I worked for. The work day was very self explanatory and when you made connections with the people around you, there were always ways to make the job fun. "
good,"The main thing here is control what you Can. CarMax is a busy company, I'm always productive. The hardest part of my job is being in more than one role."
good,"This is a good place to work, there are plenty of areas that you can apply yourself to on a daily basis. The possibility to advance and move around is almost limitless."
good,Great place to work with a lot of ways to learn and move up. I was a sales consultant and was working there for a while. worked with some great people.
good,I really like working at Carmax as a sales consultant. The foot traffic due to advertising is phenomenal. You receive management support to help you process car sales and credit applications.
good,"good place to work, too many managers slowing techs down. Extremely efficient!"
good,Currently work at CarMax in Virginia in the corporate office. It is a fine place to work; everyone is out by 5pm all the time. Responsibilities are always the same--not much opportunity for growth. Wouldn't recommend
good,A fast pace environment where development is the key to success.  I would recommend this job to anyone that has the skill set.  Work life balance is a challenge.
good,Friendly environment with a solid culture. The LGM is amazing and takes care of the sales team. Compensation is weak in comparison with the work load.
good,"I liked working at Carmax because they're a big company with a lot of opportunity to transfer around the country and remain part of the Carmax team. Like anywhere else, there were the usual complaints and moans among the ranks but the OPS manager and Line Production manager managed to put out most of the ""fires"". The leads were particularly impressive and enjoyable to work with."
good,This is a great place to work. With all of the growth potential there is no reason why no one would not enjoy growing with this company. This company has a great work-life balance and amazing benefits.
good,I would recommend this job to anyone!! I had alot of fun in the years that I was working there.
good,CarMax was a great company to learn and grow from. The principles that were taught were ones that could carry us for life.
good,"Great place to work for hourly associates. Never fall for the ""we want you to advance to management"" scheme. They do this to keep swinging for the Forbes 500 top companies list (same with their ""compass"" surveys they coax associates into scoring high in. IF you ever make it to management beware of the hidden agenda's and animosity for those who didn't get in solely on a bachelors degree. In other words, if you went to a trade school or worked your way up, YOU WILL NEVER BE ACCEPTED!"
good,"Disrupting automotive industry with Fortunate 100 behaviors, best practices providing iconic customer service experiences and ""Driving What's Possible"", one customer at a time."
good,"I worked at an hourly small format store. So we were cross trained in many roles. It made it easy to advance within the company. The hourly pay wasn't very good, but overall a good entry level job into sales/customer service."
good,Being in sales has its ups and downs the training keeps you confident though and it is a good job with solid benefits and ladder to keep moving up within company
good,"As a reconditioning technician, there are always vehicles in the inventory that need to be inspected and repaired. It is fairly laid back but also busy. I didn't work on customer vehicles, only vehicles that had been purchased/traded in to CarMax. If a vehicle did not pass its inspection, it was not sold to customers. If the vehicle needed repairs, the TPM would approve the repairs and I would perform the repairs."
good,"In general terms, Carmax is a good company to work for. Systems and procedures work most of the time. I was also very happy as a customer."
good,"Productive and fun work environment. You have to really like working with Customer's. There is a lot to learn for this job so you have to be a highly, motivated self-starter who can multitask. You also need to be a positive, committed team player due to the close working area in the business office."
good,"The job mainly entails leading a group of mechanical, paint & body, detail, supply, inventory, and service associates. Thee is always something to do and never a dull moment. Be aware that this job is demanding and requires managing at least 3 dozen associates per manager, so it is a bit unrealistic and outdated. CarMax is way behind the curve when it comes to technology, but folks there are great to work with."
good,CarMax is an outstanding company to work for. The downsides I experienced were typical in a corporate culture where it takes extensive time to make the necessary changes to correct certain business operations. Advancement is also a tough topic as it will depend on management and how knowledgeable they are in the necessary steps to progress your career.
good,Great place to work however the pay hasn't changed in over 10 years and the cars are Not detailed just cleaned before selling them. I only left because even though i put in for transfer when i knew i was moving they would not respond to me. I applied for 3 different positions and was either not responded to or lied to about it and eventually just had to quit to move on. I did love working for them though and would do so again if i was given the opportunity at the Pensacola Fl location.
good,"I enjoyed working part time at Carmax as a Buyer Assistant in 2014. My primary responsibilities included: merchandising the lot (moving cars), assisting in moving and imaging purchased cars, answering customer questions on an Ipad, and applying dealer window stickers. The company does a great job of keeping things interesting by sponsoring volunteer efforts and hosting company events. Great performance management efforts and providing recognition."
good,"Productive workplace, gain good coworkers and trust. Just like any other jobs that deal with contracted out work (Transport drivers, contractors, laborers, etc) watch what you sign and make sure what you sign for is secured."
good,Must be able to work on a straight commission basis.  If you care about other people’s situations in life then you will succeed here. Put your agenda aside and be of service to your customers and you will thrive at Carmax.
good,Just changed the sales pay scale.  Be sure to understand how the split system works.  Call center leads get half your money on leads.  This has caused a lot of senior sales staff to leave.
good,Pay and hours suck. If you are single and dont care about spending time at home this job is awesome. You can make alot of money fast. The people you work with and the management will become your close friends and make being there suck less.
good,"Is a great place to start a carrier, but once we have a family I mean a baby is a little hard to work so many hours, selling cars can be a little trick, sometimes we spend the whole day selling a car and actually for our time isn't worth it."
good,Not the easiest of jobs to have but as long as you put in the work you will see the benefits. The culture is what sparked my interest in CarMax and I had made life long friends there.
good,"*The day starts with a meeting on the day's goals and areas of improvement and recognition of those who are doing outstanding. Throughout the day you will be engaged with customers either wanting to sell or buy a vehicle. Your co-workers usually are very helpful. the whole CarMax process is an easy streamline process to help you succeed.  "
good,Pay is decent for the job. The job is easy and there’s very little micromanaging. Some people wear business casual clothes and others just wear casual clothes.
good,Good place to work. Management can be shaky but communication is key. Schedules a printed a month in advance. regular performance meetings. assistance with development.
good,Would recommend for first time sales consultant. Only car dealership that let's you be off on Saturday. Does not provide lunch on Saturday anymore just certain days.
good,The best thing about working for CarMax is the culture.  The company give updates on how well the company is doing each quarter. Once a year the give a formal thanks by having a very formal event with great food and  good entertainment. a typical day is very upbeat high energy level and multi tasking.the hardest part of the job is Being Micro managed as an adult. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers and co-workers.
good,"Commission only and if the customer returns the car, you loose your commission, basically working for free. Unless you work in California, they pay you hourly or commission, whichever is higher"
good,But the sales in our area isn't making it worth my time. It's like a family and I'll hate leaving them but I can only handle minimum wage for how much I put in for so long
good,The hours are pretty long and you need to be there to make the most money. Carmen takes the competitiveness out of car sales by conducting a rotations. They recently reduced commissions for sales floor consultants to pay for virtual consultants.
good,"CarMax main focus is shifting twords their wholesale Cars. They sales have begun to decline, however they profits are up. The make more from the weekly auto auction selling the wholesale cars they buy. The only pay you $50 is someone sells on outright. Nothing if its taken in on trade. Their advertising is geared to people selling cars versus buying cars. The have gotten rid of most of their expert buyers so they can hire someone for less to take pictures and send to one guy off sight in an office. It used to be a great place to work and make money. On Saturday they will have 60 people scheduled for a 35 car budget. That meas 25 people will fail that day."
good,"I have worked for Carmax for 5 years, in that time I have had the opportunity to advance and move within the company.  I have had some really amazing management and some not so great.  They really focus on growing the individual.  I have loved my time with Carmax."
good,Very driven and motivating environment to work in. Always offered the opportunity for self improvement and growth through manager feedback and continued e-learning.
good,Great job for those who are seeking a competitive auto work place. The employees are who make the job worth while simply because ofI left years ago but the management team at the time also made a work day as relax as possible.
good,Decent place to work. I put in a lot of time at carmax. Over 12 years. I loved the culture and the people. Advancement was stalled. I needed a change for my family.
good,"The atmosphere of Carmax was very interesting most days, as employees could still enjoy the days while the work was being performed. Management had a very kindergarten approach to solving problems, which was a cliche because it actually worked in most cases. However, the management personnel itself needed reworked due to poor judgement issues. Granted this was almost 5 years ago, so things likely have gotten better."
good,A typical day at work with CarMax entails a great degree of coaching associates to become more efficient in selling vehicles and other services to customers by providing iconic experiences.
good,It was a great job with great benefits. The starting pay is low but there are opportunities for advancement. They have a great management development program.
good,"Great company to start a sales career with. fun, great training, good work environment, great pay, no pressure to sell a lot of cars. they let you work at your pace."
good,"Good environment, great people, can play favorites from time to time. Pay is okay, benefits are good. Overall a good place to start a career or work through college. Must be all in to advance."
good,"Working for Carmax for 4 years as a sales consultant was an incredible learning experience. This sales job prepares you well. Managers are all about development and challenging associates. The cons to this job are pay and career advancement. If you plan to be promoted, be willing to move several times out of state."
good,Great place to work. But not something I want to do in the long term. I have an advanced graduate degree and worked here for extra income. Management was great.
good,"Fun Place to work, If you like meeting people. Lots of work if you want to be the best. Sales training and morning hurdles are the best.I enjoyed working at car-max."
good,"It was a wonderful place to work and I have many fond memories of working there. It is also where I met my husband! I am forever grateful for the opportunity to work there. If it wasn't for getting the position I never would have made the friends I made or met my husband."
good,Nice place to work. Struggle to partner with managers for advancement. Overall nice place to work struggle with advancements. Job is good but not paid fairly. Too much work for the little money that we are paid.
good,"If you like a fast paced environment, then CarMax is a great place to be. Management is great and the people who work there are great people! Greta balance of praise and feedback for all associates!"
good,Carmax has great job security and multiple departments but advancement is limited depending on your job experience. Good working environment and work culture.
good,"Overall, I enjoy my time at Carmax. It's a good company to work for. with decent pay and reasonable benefits. Communication is always  open and they provide employee appreciation days every month."
good,Working here was a blessing while my position was still available. Most managers were helpful. Metrics are attainable. There isn’t much advancement opportunities.
good,"It was a good job, but it felt like a big company, the technicians were kind of hidden in the back, I'd like to work their again someday, it paid well."
good,"Great company to work for. But as Sales jobs go, the pay is shaky. That, as well as poor management is why I plan on leaving. It's not that way at every store though."
good,"Fast paced, very repetitive work, managers like to micromanage, they provide all tools but they are shared across shifts and tools are lost and broken very frequently and it takes long time before they will be replaced."
good,Always pushing growth with an abundance of training. Interesting and customer centered company.  Experienced working with multiple departments and met many new people.
good,CarMax is great expressing and practicing work life balance. I enjoy the team builders and unified atmosphere. There is difficulty moving around in departments which is discouraging when the company explains its desire for you to move to the position that's right for you.
good,I believe the only opportunity this company had would be management and how loosely they check on their senior managers. My boss was never at work and hardly ever took the time to sit down on a personal level. Other managers would pick up his slack and work so much harder to make sure the store ran.
good,Good training - the first 25 to 30 days is online training with help from a mentor and your sales manager. After hitting the sales floor your mentor and sales manager give additional support. They also have a great benefit package.
good,"Retail hours, Multiple duties required of you, you will be required to learn every aspect of the automotive sales and support insustry.  A different role every day."
good,"Temporary job, but training was thorough.  Enjoyed my brief time there.  Management was always available to assist.  Very meticulous process to sales."
good,"Not the best place for women or POC to advance, but a great starter sales job. The higher paid jobs are in Virginia. As car sales places go, it is the best compared to other dealerships. Not as cut throat."
good,One client after another.  Had different experiences everyday.  Had to know enough about almost any vehicle on the road.  Had to ask personal questions with tact.
good,Great place to start out. A good honest way to sell cars. You get to see alot of differnet cars and meet a lot of great people. This is a good job however its sales s youll need to put hours in to produce.
good,"A good workplace - Customer Service was good - Service emphasis  could be taken to the next level with Customer Relationship - "
good,"The management was good, but there's little support when customers call corporate because they don't have supporting documents. One call can override policy. "
good,"Poor work life balance, not enough pay unless you work harder than you should, most managers excellent, a couple sketchy, the environment was fun but some requirements are not ok."
good,"A good to not so good company to work for. That is affected greatly by the location general manager and his willingness to keep the sales staff number low and not flood the floor. When that happens you do not get many up's / customers (You work on a rotation system to help customers ) and cannot make enough sales to be successful."
good,A very productive place to be where you learn a lot and meet many different people. You will learn the business and the ins and outs of the best way to run an office and sell cars.
good,"I was able to mature as a person and learn some great new skills that I am now able to provide in my future endeavors. I advanced my communication skills, work ethic, and overall personality!"
good,"Carmax was a great way to continue advancement in the automotive field.  I transferred a year into my time with Carmax from a commission store to a non commission store as an automotive tech.  If you are seeking to grow and develop as a tech, my advice would be to work for a commissioned store.  If you worked at a dealership for years and are looking to hang up your tools at home and go to a more relaxed environment that pays by hour, then ""flow store"" environment is for you."
good,"It is a great place to work.  If you are able to relocate,  you can move up. Managers are willing to assist you to improve your career. Fun environment."
good,"Some areas of the business aren't great, but most of the people that work there are really cool. The raises aren't a lot and part time people don't get any of the benefits."
good,what can I say the business went of business. This was an early job and I really can not remember. So me explaining this how is it going to help someone. Good luck
good,No real complaints about this company.  Its very busy and your day will go by fast.  Sometime seniority takes place and things are overlooked with management.
good,"Company provided excellent training and management.  Always trying to grow its employees.  Pay was low compared to rest of industry, but benefits were better."
good,"Great training, I had never worked with an automated dialer before and they made it really easy for me to feel comfortable. "
good,"When you go to work for CarMax every one is required to work variable shifts, 9am-6pm, 12pm-9pm, occasionally 10am-7pm. You work 5 Saturdays in a row and every 6 weeks get a three day weekend."
good,"Carmax is probably the best ""company"" iv'e ever worked for. Compensation was very nice and they had really good benefits. Work load can be stressful no matter what you are doing and you have the opportunity to move around for different positions."
good,"Carmax is a very relaxed place to work. There is plenty of tasks to do but as long as you stay moving you'll be fine. The environment is very fun. But because of the relaxed and easy-going environment, many workers here take advantage of this and slack off, making the workload a lot heavier for other people. To add to the frustration, Carmax is not very good with raises and management chooses to hire as few employees as possible in order to decrease costs."
good,"Great people, some stores have an exceptional management team while other stores have sub par management. Service department hours are Monday through Friday 7am to 6pm, you are not expected to be there all of the hours but you cut salary by a 3rd if you are not. Taking time off you only get paid for 8 hour per day while you work a normal 10 hour day. In other words you take a pay cut when you go on vacation. Weekends off are nice."
good,Enjoyed speaking and meeting new customers daily and was able to learn how a Fortune 500 company operated internally. I also got to learn new aspects in the service dept form the service advisors.
good,"CarMax has definitely standardized the process of vehicle sales. The training is ongoing, the opportunities to grow and climb the corporate ladder are endless. Work/life balance is sometimes weighed more on the work side, as you are usually running on other people's time."
good,"If you hustle at Carmax, you will be rewarded. They give you all the tools necessary to be successful. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and low pressure sales expectation."
good,"Typical day at Carmax involves keeping inventory of cars on lot, detailing cars to make sure they are ready to be sold. Great company to work for. Easy schedule."
good,"Good place to work, great training in place, up beat. Relaxed atmosphere, not your normal car buying process. We provide a world class car buying experience for the customer. No pressure."
good,Working at CarMax is like being around friends and family. They are all about Great Customer Service and at the same time a fun work environment.
good,"I liked working at CarMax and only left because I was moving out of state. You learn how to do many tasks which includes the entire process of selling a car to someone and never handing them off to anyone. The social atmosphere at work was positive and co-workers were typically nice or at least approachable, however, selling for a straight commission can be difficult and demands that you are motivated and able to get back up after a fall in sales. The hardest part of the job can be dealing with the occasional rude customer,  but I liked the fact that I learned so much about selling and a slew of other skills while I was employed with them."
good,go easy environment with some potential for advancement . some departments had openings for opportunities and some were not available unless someone left. Co workers were awesome to work with and management was ok.
good,"Great company for a go getter. Depending on the department that you work in you can get a good schedule. The work home life balance is some what difficult however, depending on how you manage it."
good,"Competency based company that offers numerous development opportunities, a good work life balance and growth opportunities.  Overall great company to work for."
good,As with most dealerships there is a lot of favoritism. The management there is horrible. The sales managers consist of previous sales people that were horrible at there jobs and now are trying to manage other salespeople.
good,"Determining if an account meets repossession criteria.   Demonstrating strong knowledge of and compliance to CAF collections policies and procedures.      Locate missing customer information/light skip work.  Trained new associates on department guidelines, effective collection techniques, and FDCPA guideline"
good,Great company to work for and a great place to buy a vehicle from. A simple and seamless process to help us deliver world class customer quality service.
good,"It is great to work with a team of folks who work together and for a Company who stands behind their Customers.  Compensation for Sales Consultants could be enhanced, but is par to better than most in the industry."
good,Easy going and fun workplace. Managers are willing to work with your real life schedule. Not much to do during slow times. Compensation can be ALOT better. no certainty to balance bills. some co workers will try to steal your customers. always check your ccm and customer history.
good,I learned a lot in this position however there is a lot of stress when you are in a full commission environment as well as as a very odd schedule. You are grantee to work a lot of hours and there is little job security. I've worked there 7 months and in 7 months 7 sales consultants came and went. that's a big number considering that that's a big number of the entire staff.
good,"♣	Responsible for store operations of one or more assigned locations, creating an exceptional associate and customer experience aligned with CarMax culture."
good,"A typical day at work would be to conduct vehicle appraisals and assist sales. I learned the value of vehicles according to market trends and how to determine both visible and hidden damage on vehicles. My co workers were all very team oriented. The hardest part of the job being able to manage multiple things at once, specifically buying at auction. I enjoy the work life balance and the teamwork environment."
good,"good hearted coworkers,typical day at work, I was forced to resign after personal family matters and the distance that I had to travel at that time but work there for 1 year did not miss a day and was never late but would not rehire"
good,It's fun to help all the different customers that walk through the door. You have a lot of consultants that are from all over the world and it is very diverse. You are your own boss and you can make as much or as little money depending on how hard you work. Management reviews your progress every month and will help improve your area of opportunity and tell you about your progress. You have the opportunity to mentor new associates and set them up for success once you become a veteran.
good,"CarMax is a Fortune 100 best companies to work for and having worked there it's easy to see why. CarMax has a fun and energetic atmosphere that will keep you on your toes and encourages you to speak with others inside and outside of your team. Where the company really shines though is their willingness to help you grow if you put in the effort. Unfortunately, due to the company's willingness to see you grow they actually promote prematurely without giving certain people the tools or skillset needed to perform their duties."
good,"People normally begin in collections or customer service. From there, as long as you have a strong work ethic, it is easy to move into a higher position within 3-6 months. Management cares about you as a person"
good,A typical day would be great with many car sales or long hours with little or no sales.  I learned to stay motivated and preserve.  The management was not very creative or innovative with sales ideas that would drive up your sales average.  The co-workers were great with giving inspiration and help in closing sales.  The hardest part of the job was keeping sales up and the most enjoyable part of the job was giving great customer service and seeing the look on customer's faces when they got the car of their dream.
good,"Good company to work with. I learned a lot about sales with this company, good training and room for grow. The store were I used to work hired around 100 sales consultants on the tax season, after that season was over, it was really hard to sale cars with that amount of sales consultants in one store. But after all it was a good experience."
good,I love the training I got from Carmax. Management is very supportive and colleagues are fun to work with. Retail hours are manageable with some occasional late working hours. The most enjoyable part is learning while working.
good,"Good company to work for, may not be as high paying as other dealerships but fairly flexible with scheduling.  I worked part time while in college and still made a healthy income, in fact CarMax even gave me tuition reImbursement.  You will kiss your weekends goodby but that is to be expected with any Car Sales or retail job.  All and all it was a good place to work, Car Sales in general is a tough job but Carmax rewards it's top performers with a free trip to vegas every year which I attended once.  My only complaint is other departments like the business office and reconditioning tend to create conflict with sales and are not always understanding of the urgency of some problems that may arise during a sale.    "
good,Didn't need to bring in my tool box because they provide the tools you need for your job. The environment was like a nice factory work shop and the workers were friendly to get along with.
good,"A typical day starts off an hour before the doors open in a meeting. After that everyone starts joining in on the ""ups"" list; Once on, you begin to check your customer database and follow up with customers until you are ""on point"". Now ""on point"", you are responsible for the first customer to walk through the door. After they walk in, you greet and begin the car buying process. Hopefully, once everything is said and done you have a sale in your pocket. Once the interaction is completed you will put your name back on the ""ups"" list, update you customer database, and debrief with co-workers AND repeat the process until the end of your shift. Pretty simple. "
good,Good Company.. Recommend as a good place to work.. Company is growing and it is a good time to join.  It is best if you are relocatable
good,CarMax is a great place to work. The culture is awesome. The industry is moving faster than they can adjust to the growth in the Finance Office but other than that it's a good place to work.
good,"Overall great place."
good,Fun and fast paced environment. Always something to do. All personnel and staff is friendly and family oriented. The most enjoyable part of the work day is that we do business but at the end of the day know how to make that business exciting and fun. The people of office know what to do and when.
good,The pay is very good but inconsistent because it is commission based. Management is always looking for ways to improve and they are always striving to help you sell better. Overall one of the best places I have worked at thus far.
good,On a day to day basis would analyze and preview cars to determine the value and worth to CarMax. Price the inventory on the front line to be competitive and profitable. Determine if the reconditioning costs would be worth it to CarMax or if we would rather sell it through our wholesale auction. Team with sales staff and mechanics to answer any question they had. Would also attend offsite auctions to buy and maintain stock.
good,Very nice place to work and training is very good. The Company is very good with training and helping Sales consultants learn  to make some money.
good,"I loved working in sales, I did it for 3 years. The employees are nice and managers are willing to help. I love the freedom you get in sales. Lots of training every few months and free pizza."
good,Carmax has great company culture.  Although the job forces you into a rotating schedule work life balance can be achieved. The hardest part of the job is working outside in the elements. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people from literally all different backgrounds. The diversity of the company really makes it a great place to work.
good,My typical day will include interacting with numerous internal and external customers. CarMax has taught me to manage my time effectively to complete my job duties in the most effective manner.
good,Working as an Automotive Detailer I had to restore used vehicles to look show room ready. I worked at my own pace. The more vehicles I restored the more I get paid.
good,it was a good place to work but did not give good balance with life
good,The harder you work the quicker the advancement. It wasn't realy the place for me but I enjoyed the time I worked there.
good,Great place to learn and grow with in the auto industry field . Lots of new staff brought on board so a lot of training and shadowing going on .
good,"Climate controlled shop, Monday through Friday work schedule. Self-paced working environment. Overall, Carmax is a great place to work as a technician. Uniforms are provided. They have an extensive benefits package. The pay is reasonable and they have an easily attainable semi-annual bonus program. They pay for ASE certification tests and have an annual allowance for proper footwear. The overall environment in the stores is friendly. "
good,Enjoyable workplace with great people. Easy balance of work and family. fun and understanding management
good,u go to work learning something new everyday they ice friendly company to work for and everyone hels ech other
good,"Huddle and practice of Sales strategies in the Morning and during the day was challenging. Every Customer is different and teaches one something, so at the end of the day one goes home with some additions to the sales techniques. "
good,CarMax is a great company. I learned a lot about financing. It will help me in many ways for the rest of my life.  I wish that it offered better hours.
good,Innovative business model allowed for much easier sales of companies products and services
good,I was well adapted to the company and industry. I was top sales person for several years and enjoyed the work environment.
good,"fast paced and challenging. Most of my day is spent balancing cost, cycle time , customer needs and quality.  I learned to manage my time, and engage my associates with challenges centered around feedback allowing me to improve their skills and in turn creat a better product for our customers.  The most difficult part of the job was not being able to affect change during the over night shift.  The most enjoyable part was seeing a car come in recieve reconditioning and then make a customer happy because of its value and quality."
good,"Good Company, Competitive Culture. If you are a person that operates great under stress this is a perfect culture and company for your Career advancemet."
good,Carmax is a great place to work and it was fun to work.  The demand for used cars was great and production levels were high all the time.  Working 24 hrs to meet the sales demands of the market.
good,I enjoy working for CarMax because it is a good company with good values.
good,"Best place I've ever worked. They understand how to motivate and grow employees. They also do lots for charity. The only drawback is they do not really compensate well, and benefits are very expensive. Also despite a culture of internal promotion it is incredibly arduous to get promoted."
good,Fun competitive job easy going and well paced. You have the oppurtunity to make alot of money. Hardest part of the job is remembering patience. But is a great place to work
good,fun place to work ...management team very flexiable and understanding ....training is one of the best....the enjoyable part team work is always there
good,Great experience and good management. Team work was great. Product knowledge was a tremendous experience I admire most about Carmax.
good,A typical day of work is helping customers and processing payments and paperwork for customer transactions. The hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people you like.
good,Great place to work if you enjoy being around cars. Carmax has a very good reputation in the automotive world. That is probably why so many people start here with their car shopping.
good,"This was a fun job it was filled with what i call family! We all had each others back and worked had to support each other throughout the company.Daily I performed clerical duties throughout the day and also dealt w customer complaints, and also did customer finance paperwork. The hardest par was not having alot of time with my then infant daughter with all the long hours I worked. I learned how to resolve issues throughout the comapny and found a love for the actual finance and customer service part of business. Management had its days but overall good we didnt haave a set manager for the actual store for a while because our inital manager transfered so it was hard at times but we made the situation work!"
good,Overall enjoyed working at Carmax. They hire great personal that really work well as team. Even though they work in different departments that are all trying to reach the overall goal of car sales and great customer service the flow of work was great.
good,"job has great benefits.......close to a lot of things in kennesaw, but in the middle of everyday trafffic"
good,nice place to work if you like dealing with people all day. comfortable work enviorment. advancement is pretty easy
good,"Since I was able to experience two locations, with two very diverse management teams.  If professional with a relaxing atmosphere is what you're looking for, seek out the North Las Vegas location.  This one was run very smoothly and solid."
good,Its a good company to work for. Flexible shifts available to work. It feels like a big family here. There are opportunities to move around in the company.
good,Work is steady. Often learn a lot during roll play and experience reviews. Management really wants to see a sales person succeed. Coaching & Mentoring opportunities are always available.
good,Constant feedback loop to make you a better sales consultant for the company.  Tons of training and a great support group from fellow employees.  Many chances to practice your skills with fellow employees via role play.
good,"Work atmosphere and culture were great. Pay structure was a little small for sales associates, compared to similar companies. All in all great place to work."
good,When I worked there it was very little room for advancement specifically in the role I was in. I have heard the eliminated the position all together or merged it with another department.
good,"NA...nothing more to say about this company. It was good to work there. Had tons of fun, meet some good people along the way. I'm still friends with some of my ex-coworkers."
good,"Great place to work. Not recommended if you have a family, hours can be long and cause issues with work/life balance. Great benefits, Great culture and work environment."
good,"During my time at CarMax, I learned professional skills that will benefit me in and out of the work place but compensation is low and work/life balance is difficult."
good,"It's a good job to begin with within the company. The actual job is quick paced, but the people working there are pretty laid back. Hardest part of the job is working regardless of weather, rain or shine."
good,"CarMax is a company that actually does care about their employees and the community around them. Corporate takes employee satisfaction seriously and they hold everyone (management included) accountable for their behavior towards each other. The pay is lower than many traditional dealerships, but they make up for a lot with a much more positive work environment and benefits that are inclusive to all family models."
good,"A little to much training and reviews ,  Very micro managed but a good company and people I worked with just wish they would of let me stayed part time. Loved my job and most of my managers  were very helpful and supportive."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a fast paced detailing service with lots to learn. There are many things I learned at Carmax but with that being my first official job I had the pleasure of learning on how to be a leader of a small team at such a young age. Management was involved enough to show face around the shops and made sure to show support when needed. The workplace itself was well maintained, equipment was well taken care of and very little complaints on conditions. The most difficult portion of the job I would say was adapting with all the different shift hours and schedules. Enjoying your job is big and Carmax offered many things such as overtime opportunities, job improvements and offered plenty of catered food services which is always nice."
good,"I loved my job at carmax as long as you work with certain managers. If you work with the wrong ones, get ready for a long night. Sales managers don’t follow policy so associates are stuck signing until the last customer leaves which could be as late as midnight. "
good,It was a fast paced environment. You had to be quick and accurate. The people were friendly and it had a good work environment. Pay sucked. Sometimes it came down to the person training you to get raises.
good,It was a good overall experience and I worked well with my coworkers. Got to meet a lot of interesting and unique individuals. The work environment was productive and very fast-paced work environment.
good,"when new managers come in from different states, it screws up the flow. morale goes down. good company, just hoped the managers knew more about the cars they were selling."
good,"Great place to work, very open and accepting, very genuine... but the service customers suck. They are constantly yelling at you all the time and want everything for free."
good,"Typically, I felt safe and happy at work. I could always go to my leads for any concerns I had, and know that they would have my back. I was able to continually learn every day and was frequently challenged to be a better person."
good,"Daily work routine laid out to follow. Learned time management skills, people/skill development.  Management supportive.  Work place environment conducive to personal success.  Opportunity to move into other company regions available.  Overall, a good place to work."
good,I enjoyed working at carmax. It was stressful but fun. I commuted about an hour each way. They would feed us lunch occasionally and sometimes have the icecream truck come by.
good,Very good company to work for if your interested in learning how to paint and repair vehicles. Fast pace environment ran more as an assembly line than your traditional shop but an overall good place to work at!
good,"I would highly recommend working for CarMax. They offer a lot of opportunity for advancement with in the company. After finishing Universal Technical Institute, to this day it boggles my mind they didn't mention CarMax as an option"
good,Training did not happen as it should for me so now as a employee under new management not performing to expectations. Which is doesn't help with confidence related to job security.
good,"very soft skin, would not take any sort of criticism. No warnings about any issues they might have with you or anything you're doing. very close minded, didn't want any recommendations."
good,"CarMax is a great place to work, I've had good experiences with the company and they offer great opportunities to full-time employees.The company is usually very flexible with hours however not all positions can provide flexible hours."
good,"As a whole working for Carmax was a wonderful job. I felt at home with my coworkers and genuinely appreciated by management. The company does a lot for moral with events like Holiday parties and monthly birthdays, as well as charity work that makes you feel like you are not only working to better your situation but also your community. On the other side of things, like any other sales job, work-life balance is off because you are paid on sales, not salary. You need to be self-motivated to work on the sales side or you just will not make any money. Another issue is that if you want to move into management, you are going to have to be willing to relocate."
good,"CarMax is a great place to work! The W/L balance seems tough at first but gets better as you get your feet under you. Management is great, they are careful to hire people people into upper positions. They are finally updating their software and purchase options to match their progressive sales style that is STILL refreshing after 25 years in business. Easy place to work, as they give you every reason to be honest with the customer and keep all policies and procedures simple for everyone. Advancement is difficult but job security is all but guaranteed; it is difficult to be fired for performance."
good,Carmax is a great place to work. We have our little community and there is space to move up as far as you want but you have to work for it. Management likes to see quality and fast paced production. The most enjoyable part is working with nice people.
good,"Work days at Carmax include a morning daily huddle, "
good,Car Max keeps you busy with different everyday tasks in a high speed enviorment. The Sales Consultants are always hungry for a sell so they keep the buyers department extremely busy.  Its a big company with a few different departments. As a young adult it helped me learn how to communicate with several different managers and too also juggle several different tasks. Car Max all and all is a great company and I would definatley recommend working there.
good,"With no other life obligations, this is a good fit. If you have schooling, or demanding family life this company may prove stressful to keep a high level of performance with."
good,Guaranteed hours and job advancement. Worked there for almost 7 years and felt like another family at times. Managment could use work.....but overall a wonderful and inclusive company to work for.
good,CarMax has a very by the book feel to it as a company. They do have an open door policy that encourages communication within the departments. The hardest part of the job is coping with the attitudes of entry level management. They feel undervalued and underpaid and don't seem happy at their job. I enjoyed the fun that the operations team can have as well as the camaraderie that is enforced.
good,I enjoyed the flexible hours and amount of freedom I was given to do my job. Developed many strong personal relationships with managers and salespeople. General manager said I would always be welcome back.
good,Overall great company to work for great training and opportunity to make a great income. Have to be determined and focus and they will give you all the materials you need to succeed.
good,"Typical day in the inventory department can be hectic especially when some of the other associates in the department don't pull their weight."
good,"good managers, long hours, long days, hardest part of the job where the amount of hours worked and the hours. most enjoyable part was the people you worked with."
good,"Very good company to work for. Very sales driven environment but backed with alot of training to help overcome objections and guidance. Compensation has changed since I have left the company, but still pretty competetive"
good,Associates enjoy nice benefits and a great work life balance. Pay is well below industry standards and on a downward trajectory. Great for learning and culture.
good,"As with any retail job, working at CarMax means you need to be able to work nights, weekends and holidays. If you the crazy hours don't bother you, this is an awesome place to work. You grow together as a team and I always had so much fun with my coworkers. We had team building events and lots of office-wide events."
good,"Great place to get your foot in the door and build sales, customer service and administrative skills. Also a great place for advancement but very competitive."
good,Fun place to work.  Quick paced and hire quality people.  Only 1 salaried position besides management. Decent opportunity to move around.  Usually have to relocate to move up in the company.
good,"great place to work, typical day would be detailing about 3-4 cars, wash bay process, detailing process, and paint process if needed. great work environment great work staff. Management willing to help if wanting to grow within the company."
good,"Good Place to work,Management changes up every week, depends on how well the store is currently performing. Good weeks and bad weeks but at the end of the day, management makes you feel replaceable and will treat you as that. Favoritism, no work life/balance, horrible management, everyone I was working with is looking for better positions."
good,"Great Culture - As one of 500 Best Company to Work For, CarMax really proud themselves to lead through their Associates. Management staff easily collaborate with one another and listen to each other's input. Lots opportunity to advance if you real apply yourself."
good,"Enjoyable place to work!  Made good close bonds with co-workers.  Great energy!  They have a great training program."
good,"Carmax deals in volume. When starting out in sales it can be rough if you’re not able to push enough units. Per unit commissions are low for the industry, but when you are able to sell 15-20+ cars per month you will start to reap the benefits. CarMax truly cares about its associates and that’s hard to find in the car business."
good,"Its a Job like any other, it is what you make it, fun paced, fast learning,  great place to meet new people from every walk of life, and best part is getting a better knowledge of the automobile industry."
good,"I enjoyed CarMax and will miss it.  However, promotion is limited due to restructuring management positions.  Benefits are awesome.  Too much micro-management."
good,"Rewarding, fast paced opportunity for someone who wants to work hard. Team atmosphere, bonus compensation was fair and made it easy to work with other departments."
good,CarMax is great to learn the fundamentals of selling.  Their training programs for each role are thorough and provide incremental check-ins to be sure the pace is right for you.
good,"In brief, working here has provided me opportunities to learn material I had not known before. Also, it provides excellent experience with managing important and confidential documents while under pressure to do so in a time constraint."
good,"If you are willing to put the effort and the time (hours....) a decent income can be achieved. Yes, long hours are necessary. Good working atmosphere."
good,"The job gave great benefits and really was set up well for success. Management was okay for the most part, you can tell most cared about more than self preservation. It wasn't a very exciting job by any means. best part of the job was the job security so long as you where not in sales and not selling so well."
good,"Good palce to work. People are great. Culture is great. Pay was good, depending on job. Did not care for the retail hours, especially with balancing family life."
good,"I worked about 5 years at Carmax  in the parts department it consisted of ordering maintaining build to's assisting technicians in parts they needed, receiving and shipping. management was fantastic until the last manager they bought into our department. they have an excellent work place culture. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with in my department."
good,Relaxed work environment where you can balance work and family life. Great opportunity to move from department to department. Flexible hours with great benefits.
good,Great job overal I live to far away for the commute and I currently work the night shift and was to go back to days to spend time with family. The trip to work would not be feasible if I where to work day shift for them
good,If you are in to cars and like a good work environment along with good people then this is the right place for you the management is okay to be honest.
good,excelente  estabilidad laboral y  conocimiento al servicio al cliente
good,It can be stressful at times but can be extremely rewarding if you work with your managers. Although mistakes are not easily forgiven. Must be able to listen and adapt to criticism. Must be professional not only with your customers but with your coworkers as well.
good,The work was good and the people are friendly. Management was understanding of important family matters. Working on the many different vehicles was the best part. The promotion of someone with less knowledge was inexcusable.
good,"entry level position. Had to work outside when its very HOT, some workers were very lazy and would hide at times. Some managers would look away and not act like a manager should"
good,I like working for CarMax. They have a very upbeat program and the management team is also very helpful.  The workplace culture is also very good as well.
good,I Really don't have anything that I would like to say about my time working at carmax. I did love it I hate that I moved to Atlanta! I am trying to get out of the car business.
good,"A typical day at Carmax may start with you being in eoffice for 3 hours taking calls and leads for appointments, one or two if your lucky. Meet your appointments if you have any, other wise you put your name on a list and greet customers based on the sales consultant who are first on the list. Lately there have been as many as 15 consultants on the list."
good,Team work comes foremost.Skills can be enhanced. Fun to work. Competitive environment. Work from home option available. So work life balanced company.
good,A typical day for me is setting up the office and preparing to handle an issue that might arise. We have financial documents that need to be reviewed and shipped out. Phones calls that deal with customers or helping other stores. I deal with the public all day and make sure that they walk away full satisfied. I have to make sure new employees are trained and we do file reviews monthly so that we know what areas employees are good at and what areas could be an opportunity. The hardest part of the job is customer service because some people will never be fully satisfied but the most enjoyable part is making those customers happy. I enjoy problem solving and I get the most satisfaction knowing that I just solved a problem for the customer and my company.
good,"Fun place to work, just not knowing what youre going to make is stressful. But overall it is a good company to work for, I just need something more stable when is comes to pay."
good,Overall good company to work for. Compensation is good. You can still have a life style that you want. Management at the time I was there can improve just a little.
good,While my sales ability did not match with  the company  culture I got  great training and good results.A person  willing to work  hard  should be successful.
good,The best part about my job is being able to work with each and every employee every day to help them with their development with the company and being able to work with different departments in order to provide excellent customer service!
good,They need to pay more on commissions.  Lots of turnover.  Retail sales work schedule with one wknd off every six wks...ugh.
good,"The company focus is on associate development.  They place a great deal of investment in the training process, especially for managerial positions.  They provide a strong benefits package."
good,"Overall great company to work for. Great benefits job security, Only thing is Sales is a hustling job and strictly commission so if you haven't done sales before may not be for you."
good,"Basically I would come in the morning pull up on the PC that days work assighned to me ,I would inspect vehicles figure out what needed to be done to them get with management an let them know .Management was not to bad always busy running around hard to find sometimes but overall they were not mean or anything just chill an relaxed.Our facility at the time working there was terrible tho we had no A/C in texas that's a bad thing working all day was miserable at times ..we did have a nice break room with games and refreshments that's was good an the pay was good as well"
good,"Love Working Here, Great Co-Workers And Environment. Generous Benefit Plans, Management Is Constantly Helpful And Concerned About Associates Growth"
good,I work in the purchasing department as a buyers assistant and it's a great company to work for. Work life balance is little rough for my taste but that's retail. Coworkers are great.
good,"Moving up in Carmax is difficult, they operate in a very small box and anyone wanting to move up must fit within that box.  Speak the lingo, use the key words, and be willing to deal with a dangled carrot for some time.  There are exceptions of course but few, everyone I saw get promoted save one was a very long process that almost caused each one to quit."
good,"For the first year or so, I loved working at CarMax. I came from working at a call center, where I was mentally tortured every day by people's insane anger problems. So, CarMax felt like absolute heaven!"
good,A typical work day starts with doing a report of every vehicles location on the lot followed by a 30 minute meeting with store Manager and followed by delegating employees to a certain position for the day. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with customer vehicle needs while helping keep the entire inventory department running. Managment is very attentive and helpful. I have learned several invaluable and tranferable skills in my time with Car Max.
good,"If you want to be trained in the art of customer service then that is the place to be trained. Customer will walk in and know that they will be treated with respect, and the car buying process is nice and smooth for them"
good,Carmax gives you a chance to grow in the company if its something that you desire. Its a fast paced environment focused on great customer service and team work. One learns how to be results focused despite many interruptions.
good,I loved working for Carmax. If it weren't for my crazy hours I probably would have stayed. I was just too tired all of the time to continue. I give Carmax 2 thumbs up!
good,"Great place to work. Employer supplied tools and uniforms. State of the art equipment. Hours at some locations are abnormal shift times, ie: 1st shift 4:45 AM- 2:45 PM and 2nd shift 3:00 PM - 12:00AM."
good,I love the hours at Carmax that i have Detailing is just not for me.  I work nights so I do not spend enough time with my Family.  I enjoy the people management is great very understanding and family orientated.
good,I really do not have to much to say about this job. It was a great job for part time. My coworkers were friendly and I really enjoyed coming to work.
good,Perfect for a young guy going to collage who needs a good part time great pay easy to make money nice people to work with heavy on the weekends
good,"Interacting to all different departments on providing parts as needed,you can learn something new every day of the year,good managers treatment,different cultures co-workers also to learn about,make your best to find better on requirements,recieving thanks from costumers is a nice thing."
good,"team based efforts day in and out, well put together procedures, teaches you life isnt fair until you are your own boss, over all having a good attitude and work ethic is all you need"
good,"My experience with Car max was great . Great place to learn about cars , and new approach to selling and buying cars . Very fast paced environment: customer interactions along other responsibilities .."
good,"Start out by cleaning and detailing vehicles, prep vehicles for sale, and keep work area clean. Fill out shipment paperwork and receive vehicles to be transported."
good,"Customer service.  Coaching sales consultants.  Handling credit approvals.  "
good,There is a reason why it is fortune 100 best companies to work for.  Great company to work for but you have to be willing to relocate.
good,"Over all CarMax is a create place to work, and there's a lot of good training a long with other benefits that come with the job.."
good,Most companies could and need to implement carmax work culture in their business if planning to stay in business for long time. Employees are treated fair.
good,Overall a great company.  Some culture is lost during flow down to the specific stores.
good,This is a great place for those who enjoy helping people and have a passion for cars.
good,"Good place to start working in the auto industry. Weekends off , but low pay."
good,"Daily and weekly sales training. Engaged customers daily.  Greeted customers, conducted test drives, handled all financing details.  Can be a stressful job working long hours without making a sale or earning any money.  Have been able to give customers great customer service and sell many cars for nearly three years."
good,Great company that really does focus on development of team and customer service.
good,"A typical day starts with a hello to teammates, review the que for the day work flow.  Congrats to the 1st payment od the day.  Management is down to earth and easy to talk to always have have a open door policy.  I met some of the nicest people ever at CarMax, friends I will probably keep forever.  Hardest part of the job is when you exhaust all financial avenues and the payment plan set up with a customer does not work which resulted in the vehicle being placed out for pick up.  Most enjoyable part of the day is at the end of the month when incentive numbers are posted and you can review how all your hard work paid off."
good,"Co-workers are great, you will enjoy work if you love cars. My management skills have improved since working at CarMax."
good,"A typical day at work was clocking in and getting into my office and starting my daily routine of checking inventory and any over due orders. Then I would order any parts that are needed on my route sheet and order parts for the mechanics as needed. In any spare time that I find I would do my normal check of eh&s equipment and order any supplies as we run low on inventory. My coworkers were some really good people, they can be a little short tempered at times but they were good people and funny at times. Management is very professional, they may not always have an answer for you at the moment but they will work with you until they get an answer or get you to someone who an give you an answer. The hardest part of my job was time management, most orders would come in around the same time as other orders and everyone would want there order to be top priority and it would make it difficult to do my eh&s inspections. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I got to work with they were all real characters and down to earth people, professionally though I would say that I got to work alone ."
good,"Great part time job. Not so great full time job. Great bonus every 3 months and you get a 1"
good,"Follow up with new customers via email, and phone."
good,"Not a bad place to work if your a robot . Not tech friendly . But state of the art shop and everything you will need , but your hand tools ."
good,"Hours fluctuate which makes it hard for family life.  The pay isn't great.  BUT the training is awesome, the people are amazing, and the culture is wonderful.  Really fun job.  Love going to work every day.  Just wish the pay was better.  Hard to work for a car dealership but not able to afford car payments."
good,"The further I've gotten away from working at CarMax, the more I appreciate what they offered. It's a very employee driven company. There are many programs in place to benefit the employee and overall you are treated very fairly."
good,"High paced work environment, with many departments to learn from and grow with the company. Many great people to work with in a very diverse environment."
good,met some of my closest friends while at carmax. gotta be at the store to sell the cars though.
good,Team oriented and excellent platform to grow as a leader. Allowed freedom to groom associates to lead or further their careers with Carmax.
good,"Love the other employees!! You answer a greal deal of questions, and it can get a little stressful at times. Overall it is actually a great company."
good,Exciting and fun company to work for. Their training program needs some attention.
good,"At Carmax you will recieve hands on training from the most successful sales consultants. They set you up for success from day one. One of the funnest things that Carmax does is the employee recognition that is done every other month. Another part of working there that I enjoy is how non-traditional they are compared to other car dealerships. I like how we are assigned to customers, one at a time when folks come in through the front door. There are no time limits in regard to how much time we choose to spend with our customers."
good,You never stop learning the best way to assist your clients/customers.
good,It's all about customer service and selling cars at CarMax.
good,As a office associate there is a lot of tasks at hand and extremely busy. Management does well in controlling the office so that customers are completely satisfied as well as the employees. There is a great balance between work and fun. There is a lot to learn and great people to learn from.
good,"fortune 500 hundred company that does car sales right! good people, good environment."
good,"A good place to work, that focuses on their employees as much as they focus on their associates."
good,This employer has great flexibility. Perfect job for a student in college seeking their degree. Part time employees are given the opportunity to move up and are also compensated above average.
good,"It is a good company to work for, however, if you are unable to relocate it is extremely difficult to advance your career. Retail hours and it is difficult to schedule family vacations"
good,"You work a lot of weekends, but that's what you have to do to make money in this industry. In what is typically a cutthroat bad reputation industry, CarMax is a breath of fresh air. Founded on integrity this company goes above and beyond for customers and its nice to know that your managers will have your back. Very good environment that fosters teamwork and development."
good,"great company to work for, a lot different now then from the time I worked there. but here that its still a great place to work. great work and personal life balance."
good,"It was certainly a pleasure, have the opportunity to work for an organization like CarMax where they put people first, whether it be the customer or employee."
good,Work/Life balance is one of the best I've seen and the flexibility is another definite plus. Diverse organization and great work culture. Opportunities to grow.
good,"My overall experience with CarMax has been pretty decent. CarMax is always changing its sales processes, which helps with the changing needs of customers. CarMax also offers decent benefits to its full-time and part-time employees. As a recently graduated college student, I am glad I found employment with CarMax and feel proud to work here. The only con is with CarMax is that management can either be a hit or a miss."
good,Workplace is conducive for growth and improvement.  I feel a sense of accomplishment with my time that was spent at CarMax.  I recommend the company for someone that is looking to be a part of a company that is expanding.
good,"Good people at a good company. They rely heavy on culture, and that makes you want to work even harder for them. They set you up to succeed. All in all a really great place."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is that, I have others working with me as a team, so my job has a great energy when we work together as a team running the cars through the auction."
good,If you hold a position they have trouble filling they will hold you back and fill the higher position by hiring someone outside the company. But other than that ok place to work.
good,"It was a friendly and fun environment, overall I have nothing bad to say I enjoyed my time there. I worked in both sales and Automotive Detailing, I do wish they had better benefits"
good,Hours are a normal work day shift 9 hours however it is all commission so sometimes you choose to stay late or come in on off days to make the money you need. Overall great company to work for and truly loved working for a Fortunes top 100 companies to work for.
good,"Great management, and present employees  Enjoyed the training and how easy the work was. Did not enjoy working for hourly pay. Flat rate would’ve been more worth staying"
good,"Some areas in the store can be divided, I am about the friendliest person but often discouraged of asking for help  in some scenarios, others do report a good work environment"
good,"Carmax is a great place to work and the pay is decent. Probably not the best in the field, but definitely not the worst. There's lots of room for growth here too. You can usually move around to different areas of the business laterally and vertically."
good,Overall I enjoyed my time working for this company. There were decent opportunities for advancement if you drank the koolaid and were willing to conform. Not in a bad way though. I liked the company’s culture. I did not necessarily like the pay. Overall stable job and a good place to work. Got bored and wanted more latitude in how I managed so I left.
good,Great place to work.  Great benefits and salary.   Great work. Home and life balance.  Unlimited vacation time for senior managers. Advancement as long as are able to relocate.
good,I worked at CarMax for a few months and was a pretty good job. Scheduling in the virtual office was flexible and I didn't have any issues. The work was easy and never a dull moment.
good,"I enjoyed working there and the culture was fun. I was hesitant to leave because I enjoyed my coworkers. My neurologist convinced me to quit, because the retail hours messed up my sleep. I was spending the bulk of my take home pay on doctors,  an MRI, and prescriptions. When I left, a few coworkers came with me."
good,"Good place to work, pay is great, hours and schedule are flexible. Must be willing to work outside in all types of weather, rain or shine. If it is clear outside you will take pictures for 90% of the day. If it’s raining you will option new cars, which still requires you to walk around the lot in the rain."
good,"Point system is ridiculous, if you're 1 minute late you will have to take a minimum of 2 hours of sick time or get a point. 6 points and you're terminated. Points don't go away for 6 months."
good,"If you enjoy being an automotive technician (I personally do not) this is the job you want. Great benefits, amazing schedule, air conditioned shop, clean shop with decent equipment, tons of work. "
good,"The work community was very welcoming and fun, the down side was non stop working but you did have a lot of breaks in between your shifts. Overall was a very fun experience."
good,As an Inventory Supervisor had to lead to my team to reach our daily goals or beyond. I kept my team motivated and challenged them everyday. Going into in Sales I provided my customer service skils and made sure that the customer can trust me throughout their buying expierence.
good,"I enjoy selling cars and working with people. I love the interest management showed in me and the training provided. I think the benefits are good, but the weekend hours can be very demanding because that is their busiest time."
good,"There is definitely potential to make money here. Typical day at work involves greeting customers, answering phones and leads, meanwhile test driving cars with customers and running credit applications. Best part of the job is the people you get to work with but the micromanaging can get frustrating at times. The hardest part of working there is"
good,"Very good place to work at overall. Everyone works as a team you're constantly busy therefore, you won't feel as if everyday Is the same. Only thing that can possibly be improved is the salary"
good,"My experience at Carmax would likely be better if I worked full time and did not have children to care for. My hours have been cut because we did not make budget, I work more Saturdays than was discussed during the interview, and if I want to work full time I need open availability from 8am -9pm. That schedule is not possible for a single mother. They do offer holiday pay, matching 6% on 401k, and a set schedule (with required flexibility on Saturdays) for part time employees. I am paid $12.50 per hour with 3% increase each year. I am seeking employment with Saturdays off and higher wage."
good,Carmax is a great job to work at and they are adamant about associate growth! They have good benefits and really show appreciation to associates by yearly perks/gifts.
good,"Carmax functions very differently than most auto sale shops in that there is a set flow of production with specific steps and standards for each work area. In theory, the system is very fluid, however when the human element is added, things tend to go awry. Competent mechanics and shop leads are generally a quick fix for this however."
good,"Overall, great company. It's great for entry level, not great if you don't fit the click. Also not great if you want any sort of social life and you want a different position within the company. There's a lot to learn, but the monotony of the job gets to you."
good,"If you follow the program it really works.  The training is very easy to understand and is a great way to get your foot on the door there.  Even if you don't hit commission, you still get paid."
good,"i loved it"
good,"decent hours, competitive pay, and the management is professional and organized. I was trained proficiently in every field that an inventory specialist works in."
good,"I worked in the business office first at Carmax then moved to the service side. As a service writer I would check in customers, look over the vehicles, test drive to ensure completion of work to be done, work with warranty companies."
good,"CarMax is great company. They have good culture and offers great benefits. There's room for growth in most departments, flexible hours. Some departments may need to work on management."
good,"It’s a great paying job, however it all comes down to what store you work for. I went from working part time making 2k every 2 weeks to barely $800 every 2 weeks moving to another store"
good,Good place to work and they love treating with food! The cars are fun to drive. Working outdoors was enjoyable. People were nice. I would work there again.
good,"it was a fun place to work, dealing with different customers everyday and learning all the different roles was exciting. you always had other people backing you up and since it was a salary job more or less you didnt have the stress of commission sales."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. I was a receptionist for a while then they moved me to drive cars for them to get the fixed. They paid very well, I would recommend them to work for."
good,Nice place to grow with the company.  Can be even faster if you are able to travel and relocate.They pay for advancement and training from travel to food.  Very Structured.
good,i really liked working there until a new service manger came in my last 2 months working there and everything changed. i will not go into detail on this forum because it would not be professional.
good,Good place to learn how to sell a car. the managers at this locations were always rotating but from the most part you can come in do you work and leave with very little micro managers ..
good,"Obtains the knowledge for the Department of Motor Vehicles, information regarding finance information for guests at the store and delivers customer service during the appraisal process and purchasing of vehicles in the Business office. Has the ability to multitask in a high paced environment. Attends to early and late work hours due to the opening and closing tasks in the office. Overall, loves the business environment and the new customers the job brings everyday."
good,Great place to work. They encouraged your abilities to increase sales. Fun atmosphere to work in but very busy at times. Chance for movement upward in the company.
good,Great work environment. Position as a customer specialist involved just about every aspect of the car buying experience. Management did there best to prepare everyone for there daily task. Busy and fast paced at times. Pay did not match job responsibilities.
good,"The work life balance is challenging because it is a retail business. You must be able to work weekends and holidays. However, you do get paid double for working holidays, if you are an hourly associate."
good," The following are the job duties that I performed at Carmax on a daily basis:"
good,"During my employment at CarMax, everything was always faced paced. It was never bad to always be busy because it made time go fast and there was always something to do. If you needed down time to finish up on a project or on your training modules, the management team would always be on top of it and let you have the time you need in order to finish said project/training."
good,"Great place to work if you can keep yourself on a schedule!"
good,"Carmax was a pretty relaxed and fun environment. Tax season, and the summer are the busiest times (sometimes holidays). Good employees are rewarded for the most part, and everyday you learn something new, which for me was the best part."
good,Fast-paced had to work in teams at times and also have to work alone. But also had pick up the slack when someone called off and at it was short handed
good,"Carmax had benefits galore, its work hours were tough and its customers were demanding.  Management was average to above average but had room to improve in many areas.  Workflow could be sporatic at times and ultimately resulted in irregular paychecks"
good,"Carmax sells vehicles with a 30-day Warranty. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong in that window. The customer will not be happy about this. It is the consultants job to ease the customers mind and take care of their concerns. The hardest part about this, which may differ by location, is the amount of vehicles that you service. A technician can only work on one car at a time. Jobs will vary from installing a light bulb to doing an entire engine. Establishing a time frame for the customer is very difficult. The consultant does a lot for the customer, but it never seems like enough to them. One car may need to get worked on by four different people, arranging those repairs can be difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job was finishing everything so that you could leave on time. Granted there are some customers that understand how a shop works, and as long as their car gets fixed, no big deal. Carmax also services any vehicle with a current MaxCare Service Plan aka extended warranty. This is a whole different story and can be hard to explain to the customer if they have never used their warranty and did not know what to expect when they check in with the consultant. All in all it had good days and it had bad days. I just recommend anyone taking on the challenge to really take a look at customer service jobs and compare dollars versus time."
good,"From what I understand most stores operate better than mine. My experience is highly biased promotions and people getting pushed out of leadership positions for no reason other than being disliked. The environment is fairly calm and it is nice not having people breath down your neck while performing repairs. Shop is clean, tools are provided but very limited when it comes to specialized tools for certain repairs, and the quality is pretty low."
good,"Ordered and received in auto parts for vehicles that are being made saleable.  Management was fair and easy to talk to and rely on.  Had many friendships with coworkers, easy to get along with and supportive.  My position was fast paced.  Need to be very organized, able to make important decisions on correct parts ordered, high attention to detail and able to work as a fast pace. Need too be able to maintain good relationships with outside vendors that order and deliver our parts we needed."
good,Carmax is a great company to work for i been working for this company sense September of 2005 I stared out cleaning car and worked my way up with there training.
good,Good environment really nice people who understand people’s schedules. They do cook outs they have Christmas parties and other holiday parties. They have a open door policy too.
good,"Carmax provides you all the tools needed to be a successful sales consultant. With Ongoing training starting day one. You will enjoy this company if you want to enjoy your day and not feel stressed. This is not the company where you will get paid the most, But that is made up for in the environment. There is much room for growth, But expect to work hard. There is no exceptions, Follow the process and you will succeed. I would highly recommend joining this company if you are just starting off in automotive sales."
good,"Walk around lot to check cars, bring cars up for buyers, wash and detail cars. Drive cars to different CarMax dealerships. Take cars in for smog checks, oil changes. Everyone there were nice, friendly and respectable. They all commented on how respectable I am and always in good spirits."
good,"It's been a good experience working at carmax, especially the location I was at. The whole atmosphere was great and friendly. It's also a fast-paced environment since it's retail."
good,"I enjoyed working at Carmax,and  thought my Management staff in the business office was very good.  The work days were long, as this was a military community and a lot of the deals came to us later in the evening."
good,Good company to work for to build experience and possibly advance. Management has clear plans and goals in place if you want to advance if you apply yourself.
good,CarMax has been a great company that has allowed easy relocation and flexible scheduling as a top performer. Changes are occurring rapidly to remain competitive with changes in technology & customer shopping habits.  As a sales consultant there can easily be a lot of unpaid down time throughout the day where you literally have little to no work to complete.  It is critical that you capitalize on every customer and build a strong customer referral system to remain successful. Payment structure is changing and it feels like the company is scrambling to remain the industry leader.
good,Great training program that helps new hired in both sales and customer service skills. The management was very friendly and helpful. Competitive compensations but time consuming.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Carmax.  Reason for leaving, long hours and no raises.  Bummer because I really enjoyed my co-workers and mangement.  They have some really good tools to help you advance if that's your goal.  If the days were a bit shorter and raises were a reality, I would've never left."
good,"CarMax was my first corporate job. It was an internship through Partnership For the Future when was in high school. It was hard getting up early every morning to go to work, but i did it. I worked in the Central Title Department; we basically was the department that actually touched and dealt with the car titles. We processed different claims from different states. Sometimes we would over 4,000 titles a day to go through. This job taught me to help wherever help was needed. When we all titles in the morning we would divide them amongst the people in the department. Once you were finished with your pile you would walk around the department and grab some from those who still has title left to do. you would do that until everyone was finished for the day. Sometimes i would finish my pile first so i would always walk to whoever had the most at the time and help them first. This showed me how to work as a team and also to work independently as well. At the end of each summer i would have to present a power point on everything i've learned over the summer."
good,The employees had a good relationship with management. Great teamwork. Great customer service was a must. The pay was good also the benefit of being able to advance was a plus.
good,Great company to work for. They take cars of their employees. Fast paced always something to do or learn. CarMax trys to balance work and life but you have to understand that it is retail and needs of business.

good,Interesting and challenging position that allows you to work with many different types (cultural and financial) of customers.
good,"Great place to work with the right people and benefits. Not a ""used car dealership"" culture at all.  Managers want to build your skills and better you as an employee."
good,"Many will tell you that there is no sales quota. However, there is in fact a sales quota, and it is quite difficult to each. You are also expected to file weekly performance reports and attend group huddles every day."
good,Its a friendly work place. If you maintain a steady work flow and constant output you'll have no problem. I learn basic car functions and customer service skills.
good,interact and greet customers. recommended vehicles for purchase. Sold vehicles and cross sold additional accessories based on customers needs. processed finance applications and paperwork for customers

good,Carmax employees welcomed me and made sure that I was on the right track. They know the job can be very confusing sometimes with the local dealer laws and they make sure you don't get left behind or lost in it all.
good,good job to have but people get over looked for positions that you are qualified for and you learn rather give quantity then quality. I buffed and polished cars for the cars we got we only had 30 mins to get  the car looking brand new even if it was not possible
good,"I was fund working at Carmax, good hours, good benefits. Honest place to work for.  The micro manage you though.  The work is not hard, the customers are nice, the staff is good, especially the business office."
good,"Meeting and making a connection with customers, asking questions and listening to shoppers' needs, then giving options and advice on meeting those needs."
good,Carmax is an excellent experience if you are a sales individual by nature. It provides a relaxed environment and a great path for sales growth. It is a fortune 500 company.
good,Great place to work if you are looking for good pay with flexibility and to be in charge of your own paycheck. Great benefits too because it is such a large company so you kind of get the best of both worlds.
good,CarMax is a great place to work. I would highly recommend to any person looking to develop a career in sales or mechanical work. There are plenty of opportunities to make a career in CarMax.

good,nice work environment. was a great learning experience. working in the service department a typical day was fast paced and high volume with customers.

good,Carmax autocenter for me is so good they give all the benifits for me all we need. Well the management in this company has a good reputation and they treated the employees well good and humble.
good,If you work hard and with a little skill you can make a very good income in sales.  In sales you have to be a self starter. Some of the workers are very young and immature and don't work too hard but the ones that do make good money.
good,es una muy buena compañia en el sector comercial de vehiculos usadosen la cual pude desempeñarme como asesor y director comercial
good,"Its a very challenging environment, due to so many brands at one place. Have to be prepared for everything, from small jobs up to almost big overhauls."
good,"Though the training is VERY extensive, it is well developed and delivers the perfect way to introduce new employees to Carmax. Management is very hands-on and almost every employee works very closely with the GM which helps create an open and positive atmosphere."
good,I like the job its just repetitive and quite a drive for me to keep making everyday. They usually have plenty of people so they are flexible with hours and schedule.

good,"Its a great job, you will learn much and their is great opportunities for advancement. Everyone is friendly, you can talk to just about anyone at any time."
good,"Detailing at carmax is fun, you get to work at your own pace but can get stressful at times."
good,"As a buyer, each morning begins with an inventory review - gather and analyze inventory levels, as well as a daily quality review of the vehicles on the lot.  Review upcoming shipments of vehicles, market trends, seasonality and budget.  Communicate with sales, business office and inventory team to ensure the store's goals are met and customers are properly tended to."
good,I would definitely recommend CarMax as a place to work. The people hear are great. It's a good atmosphere you'd want to surround yourself with. Gives everyone a fair chance to grow within the company.
good,"Co-workers are the best. This job builds you and changes you for the better. CarMax experience builds CEO's and entrepreneurs."
good,Paid on the job training and chances of advancement in the company. They have an open door policy so if something is wrong you can go straight to the top to get it fixed. I wished they paid more for the work we did though. $11 and hour isn't enough for doing legal paperwork and customer services when Dairy Queen down the street pays $12 and hour. The company has great benefits that you don't have to wait for months to get and same for the discount. You are allowed to buy 3 wholesale cars a year in either your name or immediate family which a lot of associates use this to flip cars and make money on the side.
good,"Typical day of work consisted of engaging customer walk ins as well as following up with former customers. In this environment you learned to be counter productive even if a sale didn't fall through same day. Working with the CarMax employees is great as well, very experienced salesman and woman."
good,The people that work at carmax are great to work with and the management is good. the company really cares about their employees. overall great company.
good,A typical day either starts with an internet office or straight to the sales floor. Quite a bit of follow is needed to become the best. Management is caring however micro manage your day constantly. Hardest part of the job is qualifying customers on their budget. Most enjoyable is the family like enviornment between sales consultants.
good,"The sales consultant position will teach you many transferrable skills for other positions and careers.  It is a retail business so the hours can be challenging, but the people you work with are super."
good,"sales consultants are well trained "
good,Very good place to work and the opportunity to grow within the company is great.  Meeting and helping people is good.  The hardest part is not getting sells through the commission only platform.
good,Carmax has a great work environment. I enjoy coming to work every single day because i look forward to seeing all the smiling faces at work. everybody is just so nice and love what they do.
good,"Greatly priced, without the haggles of other car dealerships.  Always display great integrity.  Quick and easy applications make the car buying experience very effortless.  Family oriented, even your children will enjoy coming in with you to help pick out your next car or truck."
good,"CarMax is a growing company with a lot of opportunity still remaining. The relaxed, laid back culture and atmosphere at the Home Office make for a great place to begin your career after school. For those who value work/life balance and working with a group of young professionals who are good at what they do and working on challenging problems, it's a good option. Management will try to find what's best for each individual, and pretty much everyone has an open door. Overall, not a bad place to be."
good,I have worked for carmax for a couple of years now and I just recently transfered from Colorado out to California the transfer went flawlessly and was very easy but my new store was nothing like my old store my old store was great there was great people in all levels of management and everyone was very respectful. my new store however is not anywhere near the same amount of respect or professionalism that I have come accustomed to.
good,"work is great either full or part-time positions. career advancement can be obtained, good commission, great values and work integrity"
good,"Good place to work, very talented and involved co-workers.,"
good,"CarMax is a wonderful place to work if you enjoy problem solving, multitasking and customer service. The management is always there for you and whiling to work with you to help you be better."
good,"Everyone here was excellent and thoroughly enjoyed day to day work. Very refreshing work environment, and very positive management."
good,Management team wasn't that hard to deal with and job had good chances for advancement if you work hard.
good,"•	Complete sales, transfer, and auction dealer contract administration."
good,you want to work on the road this company for u! the work in a safe manner and get her done
good,great company to work for had alot of fun. im gonna be honest dont mess up because they will get rid of you
good,Learn lot of new things during my work it was fun to worked with lot employers
good,"Cosmetic Repairs, Interior and Exterior Detailing. I most enjoyed getting to learn something new each day about my job, always getting the opportunity to improve. My co-workers were like family and management was always there to help me."
good,"CarMax has one of the best training programs I have attended.  You can literally come from any field and be trained to sell cars.  Additionally, the salesperson becomes involved in the financing of the vehicle when financing is required.  While the employee does not make any financing decisions, they work along with the financing companies to help obtain a car loan for the customer.  During the course of a day, you come into contact with people from all over the world and in different financial situations.  I found my fellow workers go beyond beyond to help you succeed -- i.e., mentoring program.  I also observed that, although you were not scheduled for more than 40 hours a  week, you were able to come into work whenever you desired.  This created an ""overload"" of salespeople on the more desirable work shifts.  As a salesperson, you are required to work   New Year's Day, the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas, and work on day of other holidays."
good,"A typical day in the CarMax business office, is very similar to that of a standard office. Begin your day by going over the financial transactions of the previous day. Ensure that everything is balance prior to beginning the new day. My management team is very proactive and I enjoy this most. They ensure that you have everything you need to start and if you do not. They do not hesitate to get what you require to complete your job to the fullest. I believe the hardest part of my day would be the customers that are unhappy with a particular transaction. However, I enjoy being able to turn their negative experience into a positive one."
good,"The typical work day was pretty standard. You try to help as many customers as possible in their search for a vehicle. It was a good work environment, management was top notch. The hardest part about the job was that it was all commission based so if it was your paycheck could vary quite dramatically."
good,"Great place to work. Managers are flexible if you need to request time off. Managers seem to be concerned with your progression in the company. Typical day as a Sales Consultant consist of taking customers via web/phone leads/ floor contacts. Walking a customer through the entire sales process, which includes presenting inventory, test driving vehicle, submitting credit applications to finance institutions. Educating customer on what makes Carmax different from the traditional dealership. and providing the best customer service. I've learned a lot about the automotive industry and the process of buying, inspecting, and reconditioning used cars before making them saleable. Most difficult part of this job would be the fact that it is a commissioned sales job so some weeks are good and some weeks are bad. So at times you have to prepare for slower pay periods. To add to that, some times of year are slower than others so the customer flow depends on the weather /time of year  etc."
good,"A typical day for me starts about an hour and a half before the store opens. We normally have meetings where we develop sales strategies, review new policies and train which may include a lot of role playing on persuading the customer in different situations. I also review my appointments and follow up with customers to plan my day and possibly week. When we open the store it is always high energy and about time management and team work. I like to delivery exceptional customer service to all my customers. However; one of the hardest part of the day is when your scheduled appointment and other customers they you have previously worked with show up all at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I am connecting with my client and they are finding the recommendations that I have suggested to be very educational and informative enough to purchase the item that you have suggested."
good,"Company takes care of their associates and overall believes in acting with the utmost integrity. Though I've never worked for another used car dealership, I couldn't imagine a better company for this industry."
good,"Responsible front lot merchandising, conducting vehicle appraisals, coordinating on-site auctions, and attending various regional auctions, learn the dynamics of the used car wholesale industry using various resources to determine the price that CarMax should pay for a used vehicle. Buyer’s track their purchases through the quality inspection and reconditioning process and set pricing based on sales data and competitive analysis. The average CarMax Buyer will be responsible for purchasing approximately $8-$10 Million worth of vehicles annually"
good,"dealing with customers and quality audits on vehicles"
good,"Great company to work for.  It has been a few years, so not sure what has changed."
good,"Fast paced environment where I provide exceptional customer service through assisting in contract paperwork presentation/processing in either a purchasing deal or an appraisal lane buy-in. Processing documents, filing paperwork, verify and reconcile funding or stipulation issues, and work with a multitude of computer programs and applications to contribute to the overall success of not only the dealership but throughout all are company locations as well."
good,"great place to work, well established, potential for growth,"
good,"Great sales training, would be a good job for someone who doesnt have any sales experience. "
good,enjoyable job. work with new vehicles. always on your feet. face paced. great coworkers

good,Accommodate differences with associates and develop them based on their strengths. Built constructive and effective relationships with associates in order to maximize engagement and sales. Ensure quality service to all CarMax customers by maximizing inventory by working with the buyers daily. Work with different departments daily to help maximize profit and build confidence in our shareholders. Engaged associates and set crystal-clear expectation so that they know their measurements and understand the rewards and consequences in day to day operations. Drive excellent customer service to ensure customer satisfaction. I enjoyed the culture of the business and the drive to be # 1 in customer service. The toughest part about the job as a Sales Manager is not having enough associates to take care of the customers when the store is busy. All associates have a great attitude and enjoy working for the company.
good,• Assisted customers in choosing the car that best fit their needs.
good,Work schedule is unforeseeable but Co-workers are fun and the ambiance is cool.
good,I enjoyed my time at Carmax. There is a clear path for advancement and the company's culture is great.
good,"Clock in, go to your cubicle, log in to your systems, put on your headphones and begin taking calls from customers. Take payment info from customers, advise them of days past due, notate accounts, stay within a certain talk time."

good,Great work environment and fun people. The culture is very laid back and I'm comfortable being myself at work.
good,Great teamwork enviroment. Only the strong survive on 100% commission.
good,"Training is great, co-workers are fantastic. I work as a sales consultant. At Carmax I learned so many customer service skills, and love working with the puplic in this setting. You really see how a honest car dealership can run a car sales business with integrity.It's a great feeling when you sell a car and really the cars really sell themselves because of the quality of the vehicles. That is the most enjoyable part of this job! along with the wonderful friendships made here. Carmax is a very diverse group of people. Ages range in 19-75 years. There is a lot to remember in learning the Carmax process but you are never pushed to run faster than you your able. Management for the most part is very helpful, some managers could use some improvement in their delivery of encouragement and basic people skills. Learning and growing is a constant never ending process and if role playing, meetings, goal setting is not your thing- I suggest you look elsewhere. Overall Carmax is a great place to work! And one of Fortune 500 top 100 employers."
good,"One of the best companies I've ever worked for. They're organized and move quickly for how large they are. Management is knowledgeable, which is odd since most managers aren't. I also loved my coworkers and we had a lot of fun working there but also worked hard."
good,"The position is an extremely rewarding one, that builds confidence and other very useful skills to take forward with other sales positions. The training, by far was the best I have ever been fortunate to take, and the management does care about it's employees."
good,Had to leave due to scheduling conflicts. Loved the people I worked with and the job itself. Learned so much and go to see a lot of interesting things.
good,Friendliest dealership environment...pay isn’t the best but you can make easy fast money after 30 day training. They drug test..mouth swab during interview
good,"Overall, Carmax provided great benefits especially in the Midwest market. If you work hard and network with the managers during the day and interact with other department you can advance."
good,Carmax is a great company to work for.   My job search would not even begin if not for the commute.  Driving to and from work cut down on family time which was a necessity for me
good,CarMax was a good place to work. I enjoyed the people and the learning experience. The salary and benefits are great along with being able to buy cars at a discount. Make sure to ask a lot of questions during the interview process especially when it comes to getting promoted. The promotion process is extremely tough to pass.
good,"When CAF was under the old president everything was lovely. We had awesome quarterly meetings and events, every staff member was helping one another, and most of all everyone was smiling. The new CEO came (2017) and everything went down hill slowly and smiles stopped. Overall the company has great benefits and you can grow within the company really fast."
good,"CarMax is an awesome company to work for. Great training. They really care about their employees AND customers. Management is really there for you. The pay could be soo much better, but the culture makes you stick around!"
good,Excellent place to work but management wasn’t the best. Growth was put on hold due to management not having their ducks in a row. Lost tons of good people due to lack of training.
good,Great atmosphere with a more than helpful team by my side. The training provided was a key experience and no one ever felt left behind when it came to completing work on time.
good,"This is a great work environment.  Management is fair & supporting, consistent training is provided & work environment is wonderful. The 1 consistency is almost every position is underpaid, especially sales consultants."
good,Treating Associates with Respect is the foundation of the company and culture. The most enjoyable part of working at CarMax is knowing you work for a company that has no hidden fees or plays pricing games.
good,Great job with great pay. Job was full time mon-fri but there is mandatory overtime that extend shift and adds and occasional satuday to the scheldule. The shift are self paced with the idea that going faster pays more as long as your work is done right. Not much overrsight until you find a rare situation with the car you are working on. Can listen to music or podcast the whole shift without a problem as long as you are alert to surrounding due moving cars in the bay. greak useful car detailing skills learned.
good,"We spend an average of 15 hours replacing parts, fixing major dents or scratches, and detailing to make the car look like new. Then we give each car a final quality check"
good,"Great place to work. A friendly work environment. The way you interact with customers and build a relationship with them is priceless, Its no better feeling,"
good,That I wish I could still be working there and made better decision in being more responsible with an opportunity that was taken from me due to my past background
good,Fun place to work.  Sometimes it gets crazy busy.  But you learn to handle it.  Learn a lot that you didn't know before.  you have down time so you can relax and get ready for another one. I like the people I work with and we take care of each other.  Get to drive a whole a lot of new cars that you wouldn't drive otherwise.
good,A typical day at work started by taking a look at the daily and weekly tasks and prioritizing your tasks right away. Debriefing with other leads and managers to understand how to manage the daily business. Get use to being interrupted and stepping in as needed but the day can pick up and slow down at any point. Management is awesome. I truly looked up to just about everyone. Worst part is PAY.
good,"This company prides itself on excellence and teamwork.  Although individual performances are evaluated, employees are placed in a position to achieve."
good,"Management and employees enjoy a friendly relationship with everyone knowing their roll and how to succeed. Sales associates for example can give input for their work schedule. CarMax provides excellent training options, roll playing and computer video training."
good,"This Carmax is by far one of my most memorable jobs, the staff is great all the way around and I wouldn’t have been able to enjoy it as much if it weren’t for the people I grew so close to. The training isn’t super intensive but with the hands on training they do and all the steps they take to make sure you are trained efficiently and properly according to there standards it makes the job easy while also having situations to where certain skills are learned throughout the time you are there."
good,Great opportunities to move up within the company. Training was hands on. I learned a great deal working at CarMax. At the store location I worked the employee moral was awesome. Friday and Saturday were the busiest days of the week.
good,"Working at carmax was fast paced, fun and interactive. Very good benefits and compenstations. Paid sick time and vacation time. Also after a year of employment you start to get personal days."
good,"It was a nice place to work , you meet new people daily. It isn't stressful. The group I worked with were an awesome team. "
good,Great training but compensation is lacking and it can be a stressful job.  Management is great and the work environment it great. Great company to work for its just the pay is lacking
good,Great company not great managers. Amazing benefits. As well as flexible work schedule. Have to be there for years to advance. Shop life is great and the culture is fun
good,I enjoyed my coworkers and my job at Carmax.  The part I enjoyed the least was the quality of some of the vehicles that came from other cities created a challenge.  Because of this I fell a few vehicles short of Presidents Club which allows you to set your schedule as well as increase pay.
good,"Friendly and laid back environment that is comfortable for the employees and customers.  Fun. Some slow days tied in each week. "
good,CarMax is a great company to work.  They believe in engaging their employees just as much as developing their employees.  CarMax believes in work/life balance.
good,Team members did a good job making sure we policed each other and pushed to be better. Very competitive and friendly family environment. Leadership was directly involved in the training process. Training never stopped always had something to learn.
good,I enjoy working at Carmax. It is a fast paced environment. The managers are wonderful and work with you to help you understand the job. Meeting new people everyday is a plus because you learn how to communicate with on many different levels.
good,"It was fun getting trained as a sales associate but a little confusing that they seem to keep bringing in more and more sales associates when we work on a commission basis and it makes it difficult to make great money.  I was always working over to make sure the customers needs were met which meant getting home as late as 11:30 or 12:00 am and being on commission there was no additional compensation for that.  We closed at 9:00 but never let a customer leave if they wanted to purchase  a vehicle we stayed as long as necessary, which I support the idea, I just couldn't make enough money to drive an hour one way to work, put in 12 hours and not sell a car.  I did meet my quota for the month but that is not enough to live off of, you have to double what they require you to sell to make a livable salary."
good,CarMax treats employees very well and has lots of room for growth and advancement opportunities. Overall CarMax has a great work environment and atmosphere. CarMax is a top 100 company to work for but they fail to provide it's employees with an adequate hourly wage.
good,There is always a job function to do in the Business Office at Carmax. I learned the financial process of buying and selling vehicles. The workplace culture is friendly and always about respecting all customers both internal and external. Management made it an enjoyable place to work by honoring us with rewards and cookouts. My job was not difficult and I enjoyed the comaderie.
good,"The management there is little pressure , and sometimes showing the favorites."
good,I learned a lot of very useful skills about fixing the exterior scratches and how to clean the inside of the car most effectively.  Carmax requires all detailers to train for about a month or so to prove you know the correct skills to do the job on your own eventually.
good,Hours are far to much to have any work/life balance. Becomes mind draining. Carmax cares for its employees and will assist you when you need it and work along side of you.
good,"Got along with basically every employee, well rounded individuals. Manager was considerate and a great leader, funny guy as well, but knew when it was time to work. I enjoyed my time there and the pay (for part time and my age) was what I was looking for."
good,Great company to work for! Good benefits and hours. Lots of team work. Fun job! they are always keeping up to date on training's and how to best manage your work time.
good,"CarMax offers a wide range of benefits to prospective employees, from discounts on its products to benefits packages that are competitive in the market. Multiple areas to work in from sales to mechanical work."
good,"Part time, flexible, good place to make extra money build your sales career and resume and full time positions always available. good management and advancement opportunities"
good,The benefits are nice and the integrity of the company is good. I just didn't like having to come in on my days off to sell cars. You only get a 3 day weekend off every 6 weeks unless you reach a certain club level in sales.
good,"The work is challenging, but the culture makes it worth it. The pro and con of working at CarMax Auto Finance is the same from two perspectives. There are a wide variety of positions with training available. However, the culture is so good that most people stay which make opportunities limited to move around."
good,"Working at CarMax was a great experience. I highly recommend anyone who either has experience in sales or does not try it out. Great learning opportunity and experience. Managers or Sales Managers as they're know as there, are very helpful and easy to talk to. The culture of CarMax is great and friendly."
good,"Awesome place to work.  Normal day would be clocking in, checking all your emails and responding to customers with answers about cars or pricing.  There was also an online room where you dealt with online leads for a period of the day."
good,Good company and work life balance. Do not pay buyers enough compared to the industry average. As long as you perform and are driven you will be successful.
good,It honestly depends on the department you work in. You have to be okay with getting yelled at by customers at times. You also need to be able to handle difficult coworkers.
good,"Easy, relaxed, and your team is usually very open about career development. It may get mundane at times, appraising the same cars over and over again, but its the people that make this company great."
good,Overall the job environment at Carmax is pretty good. But we defiantly are under paid according to the competition but still is a really good job to pursue a career in.
good,"Clearly defined goals"
good,"Start with a prayer "
good,"Each day was different. So many types of people everyday. Really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. Each day consisted of greeting customers, learning their needs and doing everything possible to meeting those needs. My managers were awesome. Very supportive and kept making sure I had everything I needed to do my job. Nothing hard about the job except the things uncontrollable like not having exactly what customer needed at price they were willing to pay. Most enjoyable part was all the different relationships gained rather it be with coworkers or customers."
good,"A typical day at work is usually very fast paced and busy. You are constantly using your intuition, knowledge and skills to figure out various tasks. I have definitely learned a whole lot about training due to the fact that I have had to train several employees. I think the workplace culture is definitely a very amicable one. Everyone gets along regardless of differences and we work through the tough times like a team."
good,"The work can be daunting you just need to pace yourself,  however it is a fun work environment .  Lots of fun positive employees and supportive managers and staff."
good,Felt appreciated at work.  Long hours but compensated for hard work and long hours.  Unlimited paid vacation as long as it wasn't abused.  Great learning experience.
good,You might as well live there. You will get decent pay and benefits for the relatively easy work you do but you will spend majority of your time here. Very strict about being on time. The work environment and relationships you build there are irreplaceable.
good,Great place to work and strong company culture. Need to put policies in place that don't empower tattle tales that are on their way out. Need to move people who can't cut it out quickly.
good,"I HIGHLY recommend applying to this company. Especially after graduating or if you are in need of job experience/looking for a steady, promising income with benefits."
good,Not your typical used auto dealership.  Feels more like a retail store that puts more emphasis on customer service than sales.  Really great environment and the company invests a lot of time dedicated in growth and development of all of the associates.  Everyone has been really helpful since the day i started training.
good,"CarMax was my first ever car dealership job, working there has taught me so much more responsibility, helped me gain great friendships, and better myself in countless ways. A typical day for me was to either sell or buy cars to and from customers while providing the, with great customer service."
good,"Carmax, was honestly a real job that showed me to be responsible and determined for any car. Ive learned the value of each car and how much a repair really costs."
good,I had a great opportunity working with this company and getting to know the entire staff as if they were my family. Very nice environement to work in and I felt very welcomed.
good,"Everyone at CarMax is Very Friendly, made for a nice fun work environment. very good pay along with great benefits. Night Production hours can be stressful but overall great."
good,All associates are challenged daily to be the best they can be. Training is top notch and it is part of your daily routine.
good,"CarMax is based on a culture of honesty and openness. Dishonesty is not tolerated, which is very unusual in the used car business.  I was able to sell a lot of cars while I was there."
good,Very corporate america when it comes to work politics but if you can learn the game and play it well then you will do great for this company. Most employees are really good people.
good,Great route for young adults not looking to earn minimum wage as well as older adults looking for part time work. good work atmosphere with great company benefits. Money earned is up to you.
good,a typical day is handling different customers with car issues that may need repairs. my role was building relationships with customers also making sure that car repairs are getting done in a timely fashion. calling customers daily and making sure i keep them up to date on whats going on.
good,"I think this is an awesome place to work for, with plenty of opportunity for advancement. They do believe in giving back to their employees. Also for it to be a car dealership, it's definitely more flexible work environment with the part time work availability."
good,"the company does a lot for the employees. the company will spend a lot of money trying to keep the employees happy. the company also makes it easy to advance to transfer between departments if someone chooses to do so. that being said, is someone is not working out in a department a manager can transfer someone to another department as well, but that is usually not the case."
good,"Had some ups and downs working at Carmax but ultimately it's a good place to work, I can't complain about much. Very good people work there, the management could be worked on a bit."
good,"I really enjoy assisting customers with there concerns they have about their vehicles.  I love being the one that show them and tells them how all the cool new features work on their new purchase or old purchase.  I am also lucky that when their car does have automotive repairs that are needed that I am the one they trust with get their vehicle back up and running, so their family has a reliable car once again."
good,"A typical day at work includes tasks ranging from administrative, clerical assignments, partnering with finance lenders to get vehicle transaction funded. We're also responsible for all payoff and titling information for customers that purchase or sell vehicles. Being I lead, I am also responsible for managing the tasks of all the scheduled associates, driving the needs of the business in conjunction with what is required of the business office."
good,"Carmax was great, I loved it the people. I just wish they paid more. Carmax was also fast paced. The hardest part about it was trying to get everything done in one day."
good,"On a daily bases I would work with up to five new clients and assist them trough the entire sales processes, including the financing factor."
good,Challenging and Fun Place to Work. Company focus on culture and development. You will learn a lot in a dynamic and fast paced environment.
good,"Fun and laid back place to work although there is a lot of high energy and fast paced days. Very supportive management, they want you to succeed. Everybody who works there is awesome and they are always willing to help. The biggest problem with this job is if you don't plan on staying there as a career, it's harder to become motivated and have everybody else push you to go further."
good,"Learned so much about vehicles.It is a very fast pace, but fun environment to work on. Management is very easy going for the most part."
good,Good company to work for with a very comfortable environment. Tools are provided for technicians in the shop which helps to keep tool expenses low for employees. Good upper management team with other great people to work with.
good,"Car Max is by far the best company I have ever worked for. The care for the employes is unrivaled. I have learned more about the retail world. My only complaint is the retail schedule, which is not working with my life right now. However this not CarMax's fault. I just need a more Mon-Fri position for my home life."
good,"A job with a variety of tasks required, fast-paced at times, and always something to do. Advancement in the Production sector is limited, unless employee is willing to relocate to another location. Managers always willing to help provide flexible hours for students, and also to help with career advancement. Customer interaction is limited, but all work done in this position is done with the idea of providing the customer with a variety of quality vehicular selection."
good,Carmax is a very great place to work at overall! It is very diverse. It also is a friendly environment. Employees make working their very easy!
good,"Fun, growing company, room for advancement, lots of locations, great management. Management jobs may not pay the best, but they are growing. If you are awesome, you will be rewarded and given opportunities."
good,Great work environment with a friendly people. Company offers opportunity to grow. Easy to move around in different departments. Management is super professional and helpful!
good,"There is no typical day at CarMax.  As a senior manager, I had the responsibility to ensure daily operation of the locations ran efficiently. Customer service was tantamount to the mission of the company."
good,"The Business Office is sometimes an underrated position. It is often forgotten how important of a role it is to the daily operations of the store on every end. It is extremely fast paced with little room between internal/external customers -- which is great to me. Typical training time for a BOA is 3-6 months depending on if you are F/T or P/T, so there is quite a bit to learn, however the training system that CarMax has adopted is quite insightful. It has a good mix or computer, shoulder-to-shoulder, and on job training. CarMax also puts heavy emphasis on associate development, so if you do your job, and you do it well, you'll grow within the company pretty fast. "
good,"Great people to work with, dynamic culture. The business model needs to evolve badly, as well as management capability."
good,Growing company and nice culture! The time goes by real fast during the work day!
good,"Opening the Store"
good,"Very corporate retail sales attitude...no outside the box thinking allowed. Voice of employees is muted for the better good."
good,"My time with the company has taught me how to productively work in a fast pace setting. Working with outside vending companies, I serve as a liason to recondition vehicles according to business standards. Each day, I efficiently work to maintain inventory shipments, vehicle reconditioning, and newly salable goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is working alongside my teammates, as well as interacting with the vendors, assigning work and entering invoices, as it leads to overall store productivity."
good,"Insightful, results-driven retail professional with more than 15 years experience and notable success directing a broad range of corporate and store initiatives while participating in planning, analysis, and implementation of solutions in support of business objectives. Tenacious in building new business, securing customer brand loyalty while being a exceptional mentor and coach."
good,I work in the production and operations side of the Carmax company. Much more stable than any sales position would be. I understand what is expected on a daily basis and personal development programs are in place to ensure the growth of my value as an asset to the company.
good,"The company is very good to there associates, no dislikes, except for pay and benefits."
good,CarMax is a great company to work for. They really value their employees and the atmosphere is excellent for working.
good,It was a very welcoming company and provided great benefits. Everyone worked hard and it never felt like work. I would recommend to anyone because they have a job for everyone.
good,Great management and support system. CarMax culture is worlds apart from traditional dealerships in a good way. Diverse and welcoming. Make it easy to love your job. Recommend.
good,I really enjoyed my time at carmax and wish I didnt have to move it was a great work environment and no matter the job title it was an important role at carmax
good,Work environment is relaxed. Co-workers are friendly and glad to assist each other. Management does a wonderful job in training employees and treating them with dignity.
good,I enjoyed my time working at CarMax and i really enjoyed the work environment i was in. Everyone did what they could to make me feel welcomed there and we were often rewarded for the work we did.
good,"This job was perfect for me while in college, I was able to get a car and make my payments and set myself up to pay off a car by graduation. In high school or college this is a perfect job. There is advancement opportunity, but you will need a degree for big advancement."
good,I love working for this company and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a job. There are so many types of jobs that are available and the benefits are amazing. I would have rated the job 5 stars but there is one thing that is a little bit of a hardship and that is the management team at certain times but the overall experience has been great.
good,A company of great integrity and culture....very family friendly company .. i would recommend anyone who is looking for an exciting and rewarding career to apply with Carmax
good,CarMax was a great place to work and grow sales experience skill. I worked there almost 6 years and learned so much that I could use in other positions.
good,It's very fast paste but the teams are incredible. We pull together to get any job completed when needed. Most TM's and sometimes the DM will pitch in when extra hands are needed. They show true appreciation for their workers with celebrations and potlucks. The only downside is the compensation. Other departments have bonuses every month but accounting does not. They don't pay that well. That is the only reason I left.
good,I really do enjoy working for CarMax. There is always room for improvement on their part but they offer a lot of benefits and ways to move up in the company if you’re determined.
good,The management needed help with attitudes but i miss working there and the coworkers i worked with even on the busiest of days(tax time) we always laughed and made things not so stressful. but don't expect to be buddy buddy with some of them after work...
good,"I've enjoyed working at CarMax and have formed some close professional relationships.  They offer a wide range of team-building and fitness programs, as well as providing learning and development opportunities for employees. Overall, it's a great place to work!"
good,"Before working at CarMax I had worked at other dealerships and made more money but I still enjoyed working here better. The no haggle pricing made it so much more fun. you get paid the same for any car, so you don't have to ""land"" the customer on the right car. You don't have to sell someone that needs a car, a car they don't really want."
good,"CarMax is a feedback driven work place. CarMax is focused on training, developing, and empowering its employees to make decisions and work harder for their clients."
good,"structured work days, Monday through Friday. I know whats expected of me when going to work. rotating job functions help with burn out of daily tasks."
good,"The pros of working at Carmax was that it was pretty low stress, managers cared about developing you, and we only had to work 40 hours a week. "
good,"I am looking for a company that i can make an hourly rate. I enjoy commission but it can be tough to manage finances with that type of pay. Carmax treats us very well, but a salary job is more desired."
good,"Carmax is an excellent company to start as entry-level because they give a full training and partner you up with a mentor. Carmax has incredibly flexible working hours. Managers are there to help you succeed and be a better sales consultant. Working for sales allows you to work as hard as you can and be compensated fairly for your efforts and hard work, at first."
good,"Overall good place to work for . Good pay , good Benefits and flexible schedule . It can be stressful sometimes, the Have a point system as well. Guaranteed 40 hours a week for full time"
good,"As long as you can keep your head on straight and handle some fast paced environment stress, then this is a great place to work. The management team is very good."
good,the people are great i made great friends and i would recommend the job to anyone. You get to test drive dream cars and the workers are cool as can be.
good,"Employees are generally always very happy, work wise the work was never over whelming or stressful. Did have to work in rain or cold weather but it was not bad. Very flexible with your school hours when needed. Hardest part of the job was working long hours on Saturdays and working in the heat. Other than that I really enjoyed it!"
good,"Overall great place to work. Pay was great and people were wonderful. If you pay your associates good, you will expect good from them is what I saw while I was working there and it truly did work for that company."
good,"CarMax can be a great place for people who want a more lax job, however methods of how things are done don't always make sense, but that's usually out of the management's control. The pace of progression tends to be a bit slow, but if you aren't too worried about speed, it can be a very laid back job/career. One major downside is if you work in supply, there is nowhere to go besides become a lead and progress management wise, or become a mechanic. The job itself isn't terrible, but there is no real future for people in supply who don't want to be a mechanic, as lead roles don't usually open up. That aside, nice pay, full time, and benefits are hard to be mad at, so by itself, the job is nice, however the way things are sometimes handled can be hard to deal with."
good,"the job is good, if you aren't a high up position they could care less about you, the pay for a regular associate is low, the hours you get are random unless you have a permanent schedule, a lot of other departments don't like other departments, management is good, sometimes they can get strict but that's alright. you get good sick hours, vacation, personal, etc. hour lunch and 15 minutes every 2 hours"
good,"Great Culture and treat employees well, in return, customers have a great experience!  There is a team attitude from sales, business office to service."
good,there is programs for all employees to advance. plenty of  stores to relocate to. the flat rate pay can be very good depending in location and if you work hard. paint preps in LA who have lots of work can make 80K a year. here in Las Vegas there's detailers making 60K yearly.
good,Work hours are good. A lot of extra activities for employees. There was good training for the job. Very clear what is expected of you in your position.
good,"I loved working at CarMax. However, there were individuals that were not very honest in Management. They are no longer employed by the company but they left a path of destruction behind them. Many great employees left because of this individual. I decided to leave the company because of this individual. He was highly liked by the Company but eventually the truth will surface. If given the opportunity, I would definitely work at CarMax again. The most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with my team and coaching my team members."
good,"Pretty laid back job and if you do what you are suppose to do like most places you will do well. Extremely micromanaged, other than that I would recommend working here"
good,"Love working at carmax, everyone is always friendly and the company is a great place to move up if you want to.  I'd recommend this job to anyone looking for a place to start."
good,"It is truly what you make of it.  They make car buying easy as well as car selling easy.  Give it a go, they're are always hiring as the turnover is high but I believe it is only because not all are cut out to sell in a 100% commission environment but they truly make it easy if you're willing to put in the effort."
good,Great place to work. The benefits are awesome and the pay is decent. The only thing that needs a little work is the management. Other than that they are an awesome company to work for.
good,Company culture is great. Management can have a little favoritism but overall its a great company to work for. Compensation can be better. pay increase almost yearly and benefits package is great. paid time off
good,"The culture at CarMax is amazing.   There is great potential to grow your career at this company.  Management knows who you are, and make a point to say hello and help you when needed.  "
good,I enjoyed the 3 some odd years I worked here. The work environment is fast paced and the people are friendly. I was voted to the Presidents club my first year there and you get to go to Vegas for that which is cool. Carmax has great benefits and I honestly don't have a bad thing to say about them!
good,"Love the opportunity they afford me to spend with my family, Sometime feel like as a manager doing busy work. Good positive atmosphere to work in. Positive environment"
good,Carmax is looking to expand and will be building new stores. Carmax is the leader in the used car business and is very dedicated to the experience they provide for their customers.
good,"My typical day at work consisted of daily shipments, constantly incoming and outgoing vehicles and merchandise. My attention to detail was crucial to make sure that no mistakes were made. I learned how to work well with large groups of people to accomplish goals. The most challenging part of this job was teaching new employees our computer systems as there was much for them to learn. The most enjoyable part of this job was working in and out of new vehicles everyday."
good,Carmax is a great Blueprint for buying and selling cars. I believe they had a great idea and it worked well. The hours are long so that's hard to balance your life from time to time. The value in the job is the learning experience and the customers that I met..so incredible! I loved taking care of them and hearing their stories and making sure they had an outstanding experience. I personally had an amazing manager. I missed him when he got transferred. We were the number one appraisal store in the country. We supplies a lot of stores with cars. We also financed 96 % of our customers!
good,"Carmax has a very relaxed vibe and environment, and even though they have a system for any and everything, it is somehow a mess of people who don't know the answers, unless they've been there for over 5+ years."
good,"really great place to work, the co workers are great but be careful with the higher managment bc they will try to screw you over."
good,CarMax was a place that I could tell really cared for its employees and to me no matter what your hourly rate is or your yearly salary when you feel management really cares about you personally than your experience and time there will be grand.
good,"CarMax is a great place to work for several reasons. First, it's a no pressure environment. Customers that come in the store do not get the sense that we are forcing them or pushing them to buy a vehicle. Also, working at CarMax has allowed me to learn something new every day. My co-workers are a great bunch and it is nice to enjoy the new initiatives that the company launches."
good,"Good hours, good managers, good work/life balance, pay could be better"
good,Work as a team and the company will never fall apart! how to be a out going team member.
good,"I was on the sales side of things (Sales Consultant). It was very laid back and the managers were fair. I've had sales jobs before but this definitely had the best training in mind and if you dared, the Kool Aid was a bit hokey but it didn't taste too bad (if you know what I mean.)"
good,Great company to work for! Hard work but worth it...Co-Workers are amazing but the management needs some help!
good,"It was a very rewarding experience for myself, I learned so very much, in addition to what I already had experience in and already knew so much about the Industry, their Standard Work program is very needed in todays society, and really helps all Employees be a union and working team together. The Management and Staff were all so very helpful as well. The hardest part of the Job for me was the hours and schedules, like weekly working 1:00pm-10:00pm, 12:00pm-9:00pm shifts was difficult, as I have never worked those kind of Hours before, also clocking in on a time clock and their Points system, If you clocked in 1 minute late after a few times you would obtain a point and it was quite difficult at times for me as I lived 25 minutes away,and traffic or construction seemed to be a problem for me.     "
good,Work day starts at 7:30 ended at 4:30 we were responsible for all minor and some major car repairs including oil changes all the way to major engine work.
good,"Carmax has a great sense of family and well being. The office environment is absolutely great. I truly enjoyed my job there and thats why I was able to cross train and learn every persons job in my department. I was also a part of the Lean Process Team. We evaluated the work processes and streamlined them. I was forced out of my job due to HR personnel not handling my medical leave correctly. I took the matter to VA Employment Commission. The person at Carmax HR reported that they had not heard from me AT ALL during my leave, nor had they gotten information from my doctor. After presenting all of my evidence, which included my phone records that indicated over 12 phone calls to my supervisor and to HR with over 2 hours of talk time and a conference call with MY DOCTOR, I won my case. I feel that this was personal, and not because of any ill feelings, but because she didnt handle my case right and did not want to say so. I would have stayed at Carmax. I even had a chance to leave with a salary raise from another company. I presented that information to my manager and management countered the offer to get me to stay. I absolutely loved my job, my coworkers and the environment. I was looking forward to going back after my life saving surgery. I would love to go back there now....but not with the same person in HR. If HR has any negative issues with you then I feel that they will always try to get rid of you. I may be wrong...but thats what Ive always seen. I would encourage anyone to work at Carmax. The company is great!!"
good,"A company with a true people first culture that extends to their employees and their customers. Everything you hear about how they do business is true. They are honest, sell a great product and treat their customers with respect. It is the one place where you feel good about being a used car saleasman."
good,Great job and benefits ability to be promoted depending on what department you’re in. Sense of purpose. Great culture in the workplace makes the job fun and entertaining
good,"CarMax is a great place to work, it has afforded me plenty of opportunity. However, not every store is the same and some have years of bad culture and miss management."
good,Firstly the growth here is incredible I started in inventory and moved up to buffing/sanding in detail. Theyll train you from the ground up and you can move to virtually any position within the company. Pay was competitive and consistently being reviewed around the nation for additional raises. I truly regret leaving this company and would recommend it to anyone.
good,"The job wasn't hard, but could get annoying depending on various supervisors/manager telling us different approaches to the same problems. This made dealing with certain issues difficult and often times we did what we thought to be the correct way. Almost always they defaulted with what we did. Aside from that, it was pretty laid back depending on our lot load. More cars coming in meant more QA to do and more cars to wash after all other important tasks were done. Everyone was friendly and worked well with each other. Almost every week there was free food in the breakroom for various things, like meeting sales goal or being number one in the region for sales or inventory achievements."
good,I really enjoy working at Carmax and I really enjoy the environment and the hours with the benefits were amazing. I am looking for more of an outdoor Job so thats why I am looking at being a Park Ranger
good,Nice place to work with benefits and training provided! Good to start your car sales career and learn about customer financial situations. Definitely recommend it!
good,"This job fluctuates a lot so you need to be able to adapt to different days and situations. A typical day at work includes greeting customers, guiding them to find the right vehicle, and walking them through the steps (test drive, appraisal, financing, paperwork, etc.) The culture at Carmax is very inclusive and welcoming for the most part. The management seem to really care about sales consultants' development and they try hard to be understanding about personal life issues as well. The hardest part of the job is dealing with frustrated customers because car-shopping is stressful enough as it is. There is also not a ton of flexibility when it comes to scheduling and it is all commission so you never know exactly what you'll make (although, you never make less than minimum wage for your hours worked). The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a customer's face after helping them into a better vehicle after they have been through a hard time. Helping deserving people makes it worth it."
good,Fun place to work relaxed and flexible but not huge room for growth potential to make decent money with working low hours however can be capped for full time employees provides full benefit options and 401k
good,Management works really well with my college schedule.  Have the opportunity to make as much money as I want.  Full commission job.  Great team at my store!
good,Very good place to work. A lot of compassion shown and they love their employees as long as you are willing to work. They are a very good company to be with.
good,Carmax is a family and cause it was a family everyone in each and every department worked together to make CarMax reach its daily targets and making it easier for individuals to hit their daily targets as well.
good,"Since I've been hired the company has been great. Since CEO Tom Folliard has stepped down, the company has moved from focusing on quality, to focusing on quantity."
good,"Business Office Associate's do alot of the work. They coordinate with every single department, but they are very underpaid. Not the least underpaid in the company, but underpaid nonetheless. Before you apply for this position understand that you are not just processing paperwork and answering the phone. You will be face to face with customers and need to understand the contract they are signing, you are responsible for titling issues between your store and other dealers, they will be calling more than customers. You will be resolving issues with financial institutions (banks, credit unions etc..). When service is closed after 6pm and on weekends, the business office because the new center for service complaints and is responsible for helping them get into a loaner. You have to prepare titles and the assigned paperwork for truck drivers, often during a busy Saturday while sales are at their peak for the week and you have angry service customers asking you whats wrong with the vehicle they bought Friday and why no one told them service would be closed on Saturday. "
good,They really do care about their people and that shows in the benefits. They focus on Associate development and helping achieve your career goals. Consistently meeting and making sure you are aware of your career path.
good,Great place to work with great benefits and a great environment but it takes a long time to get a higher paying position in the company even with hard work.
good,"Great company and great place to work!  Provide you with tools and resources to help you succeed.  room to advance and transfer to other stores.  weekly huddles and training.  "
good,"Carmax is a great place to work with unlimited potential and growth. You get work in a low pressure sales potion."
good,Very enjoyable place to work. Learned about the process in what happens in car buying and selling. Management are incredibly welcoming. Hardest part of the job could probably be there was always something new to learn.
good,Typical day a work is that I come in with a positive mindset. Knowing that its gone be a different day everyday of the week. I go to our meeting and discuss the plan for the week. The hardest part of the job is the commission part. Most enjoyable part is the positive of working with my co- workers.
good,"Great place to work all around, excellent compensation and room to advance. Amazing workplace culture. Many opportunities to advance. Company very focused on raising talent from within."
good,A great place to work with considerable training in sales and ample free time to practice it. Co-workers are fun and take the time to enjoy each others' company
good,"For all this time Carmax has provided me a fun and productive workplace; I am certainly grateful for the opportunity to work here and for the skills I have learned. It is important to me that there is a social component to the work I do; I enjoy relating to and interacting with people. Carmax has provided such a friendly and supportive environment. While I feel that I have received a professional education here, the main thing that is missing – to me – is stability and certainty. I have a young family to support and encourage; it would be nice to work in a field where, at the end of each day, I can feel that I was successful in a product-oriented sort of way and that the office I work in is a better for the work I have done."
good,Room for advancement if desired. Training is very extensive as well as the hiring process for most positions. They treat their employees well but require a lot as well.
good,"CarMax is a fast pace car industry company. The company will try its hardest to pursue the needs of each and every customer, as well as their employees. When it comes to the management team their work ethic is not always the same as the company itself."
good,"Great place to work, great team environment with a sense of purpose. Has plenty of room for growth and personal development. Carmax has a great management program with leadership training, A typical Day, is high paced, structured, and light stressed. I was given the opportunity to share process improvement ideas, create a plans, implement processes and report on progress being made. Some of these plans are still being used to this day. Management has an open door policy which they stand by and are always willing to help with any issues and recognize great work. the most enjoyable part of the job is the team work , everyone is looking out for one another."
good,Great experience can't wait for more people to join the team to help lighten the load for those who have so many tasks to complete. The bigger the team the better the time of completion
good,Opportunity for growth and development with an expanding company. Company provides individual training program providing  additional strengths for specific positions.
good,"Carmax was a great place to work. Its a large company that really does care about you and try to make your work environment enjoyable. It offers tons of benefits, a great 401K match, time off, PAID PATERNITY LEAVE, and much more. The job is fast paced but not stressful. Also its hourly, not flat rate."
good,"I liked working at Carnac. I liked the no haggle on vehicles. The main problem I had at Carmax was I was doing customer service work and if a customer had a bad buying experience. They had no monetary way to please the customer. No free oil change, I had nothing to offer the customer to compensate for a bad experience"
good,Carmax is an environment where everyone works together to make the car buying  experience enjoyable and stress free for the customer.  It takes teamwork and every department in the building working together to accomplish the smooth car buying process for the customer.  You will always see the different departments working together to accomplish the end result.
good,"I like Carmax a great deal, ever since I started everyone here has treated me like family. Carmax has a great CEO and I do not have a single complaint."
good,The process was easy and the compensations were pretty good as well. I worked there for eight years and would have stayed if the economy hadn't crashed.
good,"Amazing company, benefits are amazing, culture is Beautiful, freedom to be who you really are. Going to miss them for sure. The dynamic changed so it’s time I change."
good,"Not sure if my review could even be considered as I have been a contractor employee at CarMax for almost seven months now. The work culture is great! People are nice. I have learned the tasks fairly quickly and have proven myself to be an asset to my team; however, CarMax seems to pride themselves on hiring internally. I enjoy working for the company so much, that I tried applying to two positions and after two months of no response, I received the ""we decided to go with other candidates email."" Not sure if I'm just not qualified, but like every job, they will train you, so my suggestion is, just apply and try and hope for the best. They seem to get great benefits and perks!"
good,Stable and reliable place to work. Well organized and structured. Management is always involved with employees to achieve best customer service performance. You can grow within the company and company values loyalty and dedication.
good,"Some of CarMax's core principals are having fun while you work, open door policy and diversity.  "
good,They have a great vision for their company. It’s doing great and tries to for a friendly environment. They put their customer first. Top sellers are rewarded with perks.
good,"CarMax sucks! Not a good place to work for mature people. Everyone is to laid back and there's very little structure. If you love sales you can really make good money here, dispite people returning cars and them taken the commission back from your next pay check. CarMax Sac-South"
good,Great place to work; but the pay is awful. I wish they paid more then what they do for the work that we do. Its not fair but working there was enjoyable.
good,"Can be a very stressful job when the leads are pushing things on to you. It is a pretty easy going and laid back place to work when its slow. Lots of great people, and you will meet a lot of interesting people."
good,"I was considered a Collection Specialist, in this position you basically did telemarketing collection calls.  The best part of the job was if I could find a solution that would help the client get caught up on their payments without straining their situation somewhere else down the road.  The hardest part was how regimented and robotic the job was.  I do not do my best sitting in one place for five hours a day repeating the same thing over and over.  I found it not to be challenging enough for me.  The management were all very good at coaching and giving feedback, I had a lot of respect for them."
good,"There wasn’t always a routine, you learned something new everyday and that was the fun part, the employees and managers were nice and helpful. CarMax is a fun environment to work in!"
good,Great training for entry-level sales associates. Ongoing support for the development of necessary skills for success. Great starting point for sale field.
good,"For a part time job it was okay in the Business Office. Pay is decent but could not live off of. Cannot negotiate pay, everyone starts same regardless of experience. Raises are given once a year and was typically .10. They just started part time getting vacation when I left. If you need to supplement income it’s a good place to work. You do have to work 20+ hours at part time."
good,"It was ok. There were more stressful days than enjoyable days. The pay rate was competitive & stressful. But the management was amazing , they were understandable of everything ."
good,Sales and Lead Receptionist. Test drives was the funest part. I took part in helping managers with the hiring process as well.

good,"Fast pace, management and employees help each other learn and grow. Many chances and learning opportunities are given. hours vary, very flexible with employees who are seeking to go to school."
good,Carmax is an “ok” place to work. Management thrives on sarcasm instead of helping the associate be better they make sarcastic jokes. Pay is good for the work load most days. Extremely fast paced environment selling 10+ cars a day. Company is growing and if management likes you then you have opportunities to move up. A lot of broken promises to those less favored about advancement.
good,"I was there very briefly, but very organized. Although it is a cubicle farm, there are a lot of benefits and chances to move up in the company. You get a coach as well to walk you through changes."
good,"CarMax is a Great place to work. Be a team player and thrive. You can set your own schedule. You have to be the type of person that likes to earn your money not just show up. As a sales consultant you make commission. If you want to get paid for showing up find an hourly position, you'll be much happier. But you can earn a great living on commission sales at CarMax."

good,"My typical day was to open and/or close the store. Set up cash drawer by assigning someone or completing myself. I enjoyed interacting with the internal and external customers. During my employment with CarMax I was exposed to many different positions within CarMax. The hardest part of the job was the retail hours and for me advancement if you are unable to relocate. "

good,There was always something to do. I learned something new everyday and it broadened my work capabilities. The most enjoyable part was helping take the cars and get them ready for customers.
good,Great policies and good work environment. Wager for the job isn't bad. Great place to grow but have to be dedicated and persistent on what department you choose to go to.
good,night shift was veary organized and was a veary tuff environment for a person that could not handle the work lode veary good for some one with no kids or married

good,Great people to work with. Must adapt to weather changes.
good,I learned how to detail a car. It was a fun working place with great co-workers
good,"On a Monday morning I would come in and prepare for our weekly auction. My responsibility at auction is to assure that the title for the vehicle sold has the correct dealer name on the title sold. Also to work closely with other team members to be sure the auction runs smoothly. When I look back at when I first started with the company my knowledge has grown so much since then. I've learned a lot about the used car market, financing, DMV requirements for registration, organization skills etc. Our managers all have an open door policy and I feel comfortable going to any of them for anything. The hardest part of my job would be time management, though I manage my time well it is easy to lose track of time you've spent a project. Something I enjoy most about CarMax is our monthly meetings it really helps us know where we're at as a team, how far we've come and also what is needed to reach out goal."
good,"CarMax is an excellent company to work for. A typical day at work as an inventory associate can be fun, but it can also be hectic at times, depending on the workload for the day. Over the course of the 3+ years I've been with the company, I've learned a great deal, from how the vehicle detail process works, to how the inventory process works. The management at CarMax is extremely flexible and easy to work with. If I ever had a question or concern about anything, they are always there to address the questions and concerns accordingly. My co-workers are what makes the workday pass by faster. While we are working to complete our difficult tasks at hand, we try to make work fun with an occasional joke or laugh here and there. The most difficult part of the job is being able to complete all of our tasks in a timely manner, given that our workload is often bulky and we cannot have a fragment of overtime. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to lend a helping hand whenever help is needed."
good,"Was a great start to my professional work experience. My co-workers were amazing people to work with and very supportive. The managers and supervisors were dedicated to my success and were consistently available for support when I needed them. CarMax taught me the basics of sales, marketing, finance and customer service. It was a wonderful company to work for with great benefits! I was awarded several recognition awards and really appreciated the company-sponsored award trips. The company is very innovative and provided a great opportunity to me to learn and grown and to eventually become a sales mentor/trainer."
good,"Very productive place to work. Decent pay, with overtime available."
good,"overall good company to work for, they have an outstanding benefits package"
good,"Hours were a conflict with my daily life schedule, (College). Point system of six points. Wonderful set up for employees and coffee, vending machines, phone charging stations. No experience, don't worry. Trainable and determine, you will be fine. They offered a thousand dollars bonus to several groups for sign on."
good,"Sales life at Carmax is better then similar dealerships. The work life balance is a lot better. Plus paid holidays, 3 wholesale purchases per year and tons of other benefits."
good,The most recent store does not have as much income potential as previous stores I worked at. Not as much foot traffic nor web leads. I could make as much working part time at other locations
good,"I loved this company dearly, I wasn't crazy about my management but overall I would work here again in a heartbeat. I learned a lot of useful information working here."
good,Theres a lot of training that mostly revolves around maintaining the Carmax image. The sales can be easy here and is treated like a customer service position by managers.
good,Learn a lot focused on selling and product knowledge hardest part of the job is working not selling then not being able to pay bills the tasks are easy
good,"The people I work with are amazing, The Management seems a bit over worked and limited due to new structure placed my upper level management. This creates a moderately stressful environment there is a bit of micro management. In the most part I feel that everyone is great at what they do because Carmax has a selection process in place that has pretty much all the same personalities."
good,I would great customer to the salesmen. Answering the phone. Prepare data reviews of the sales. Move cars to different places on the lot. Got to drive and learn how to detect a car qualities. Trouble shooting. The hardest part was wanting to purchase all the cars.
good,Good company to work for. Management weren't really interested in our concerns. Overall good company to work with. Best part of job is the people I work with.
good,"Conduct accurate vehicle condition assessments by collecting, recording, and"
good,Maine is a huge state and living in South Portland is a great expense. Finding a place to stay close to work with a family is impossible that is affordable. Thus making it a long commute in hazard weather. South Portland store managers and co workers are amazing. Working with this team is the best.
good,This is a very demanding and time consuming job.... it's not meant for families or significant others.... even part time is time consuming... if you are looking for a job to progress fast carmax is it... they develope you and take the time to work on you.. it's a job where you do learn a lot and do everything...
good,"Its a good company, they train you for your position and continue to train yoy as you go along with your desired position. And the pay isn't bad as well"
good,"As with most companies there were good managers and bad, but a new experience was that there were supervisory people who truly cared about you and your development within the company, and personally."
good,I really have enjoyed my time here at Carmax. They have taught me so much about not just selling but consulting customers. Finding out there needs and matching those to the right vehicle. They are also a very understanding company and understand that family comes first.
good,Carmax is a great place to work.  Operations could step up a bit more and make sure sales consultants are not wasting time chasing cars around when they could be selling.
good,"I enjoyed most aspects of my job at Carmax. I had the opportunity to advance and I did advance in my career there. The salary was fair and there are bonus opportunities, like most sales positions. "
good,"A great place to start a Sales Career!  Easy to sell car's, usually a fun place to work.  If your willing to transfer there are opportunities for advancement."
good,good place to work people care about you there but management is very bad at the norwood carmax but i have heard of the management at other carmaxs and ive been told its better then the management in norwood
good,"Work day starts at 7am which includes the morning meeting, the review of previous accomplishments and challenges, also review daily appointments, arrival times and current work in progress. Been organized and manage time properly sets the tone for a productive day."
good,"Carmax is a fun fast paced company to work for, but straight commission can be scary at times, especially depending on your expenses. Management is easy to get along with at times and coworkers were great"
good,excellent place to work. they took care of me and always try to make me be more successfull. only bad thing is that the pay is low to the amount of work that you do and the life balance is not as they make it seem like.
good,A typical day at CarMax is either 12-9 or 9-6 shift Monday through Saturday. It is not uncommon to work longer then your scheduled shift. We wait on an UPS list and when a customer comes in we greet them and work to sell them a vehicle. My co-workers become people you are friends with because you spend more time with them typically then you do your own families and because of the waiting at the podium for a customer to come in. The hardest part of the job is waiting hours for a customer and/or not selling anything in a day because its slow so you go home and made no money. The most enjoyable part of my job is that we are treated more self employed we self manage ourselves and get to meet new people so the job is never the same in respects to the different types of people you meet through the vehicle buying process.
good,This is a fun place to work. The training and atmosphere are excellent! They want you to succeed! Everyone is friendly and team oriented!
good,E uma empresa de pequeno porte mais muito boa de se trabalhar o diretor da empresa deixa os funcionários bem a vontade tem bons colegas de trabalho bom ambiente de trabalho tranquila. Praticamente e uma rotina des da primeira hora da manha ate a hora de saida parte dificil nao seria na empresa e sim com as outras empresas ex: transportadoras parte agradável são os colegas de trabalho
good,"Great company."
good,"Job description "
good,"I would recommend Carmax to any individual who is looking to make great money fast! The commission layout is great and you can work as many hours as youd like. Of course, in order to make a lot of money, you have to be there more often becasue your are on the customers schedule. not yours"
good,I worked as a Customer Service Reprensentative so my duties were answerin inbound and outbound calls filling paperwork and also putting orders into the computer
good,Read above that pretty much sums it up. work mon -fri from 7 to 6 every day and very high stress. co workers are nice for the most part.
good,"Management could use some improvement, and it was hard for a lot of people to advance quickly in positions and compensation. I did like the job culture they always did cookouts for the workers when we hit big numbers, but as an individual the company did not help me to grow with them."
good,Great place to work while perusing your goals in college. Great flexible hours and a great atmosphere! I loved working there and it has great pay for the amount of work you do. It feels like a family through and through.
good,Very strict and didn't get paid enough for the amount of work you do. Love the fast pace but the culture was micro managed. Very hard to hit your quo because it was set very high. Enjoy my coworkers
good,Great work environment and nice people to work with. Excellent benefits for full time employees was a plus. Customer service in every department was top notch
good,"Good place to work, but best if you live close to dealership so you can be there to help your customers.  Hard to do living 65 miles from work.  At work at 8 for sales meetings, open at 9 closed at 9 6 days week 12 to 7 on Sunday.  Got 1 weekend a month off.  If you work just 40 hour week do not expect to make a good living. You need to work 45 to 60 week and be willing to give up your off days."
good,"Great place to work, advancement depends on the department you work in and managers are encouraged not to manage, but rather babysit employees who essentially can over rule their authority."
good,"You spend a lot of hours trying to make commission, and there are some associates who have learned how to steal deals, so you have to be cautious. However, the hourly compensation (which kicks in if you don't meet commission requirements) makes the job much less stressful and more secure. They also have fantastic training and development resources."
good,CarMax provides an excellent experience to the consumer and their training is extensive and effective.  Selling cars the CarMax way is a way of life at the company and that methodology translates into sales.  Their policy of complete transparency helps customers gain trust in the company and the consultant.   
good,"Carmax is a VERY fast paced enviroment.  I like the pace, it makes one's day go by quicker.  I like Carmax, just can't advance so it is time for me to move on."
good,Carmax was a fun and enjoyable place to work just the distance was to far for me drive.  The people were nice and would go out of their way to help you if you needed help

good,"I had so much fun working at CarMax. I've learn a lot about automotive industry. Good Co-workers. If you like face pacing dealership, this is it. CarMax is unlike the other traditional dealership. No hassle no haggle is great for Sales Consultant."
good,They treat customers and employees with respect.  A typical day starts with a review of daily expectations and goals. You know each day what is expected and are recognized daily for meeting those goals. At any given time there is some productivity contest going on that can be won by a dept. or whole store.
good,"•	As an employee I demonstrated the following skills and perform tasks: Provided superior customer service and sales experiences, answered phones and directed calls, entered appraisals, data entry, processed credit applications, prepared vehicles for final sale and conducted test drives."
good,"Great place and Great employees. But they mass hired and people couldn't even make enough money to pay their bills."
good,This was one of the best jobs ever had! The excitement of the auctions and the co-workers can not be duplicated. The environment is welcoming and filled with peers that honestly desire to be better daily. CarMax has proven quality and great benefits.
good,I enjoy the type of work I do and the business model. My coworkers were genuinely friendly and helpful in making me comfortable.
good,"A typical day or my I call it ""work flow"" requires internal and external customer service at all times. What I have learnt and was able to experience was the fundamentals of six sigma.  Management there is always room for improvement and co-workers will be co-workers. The hardest part of the job is advancement, and the most enjoyable part of the job was serving customers hearing and feeling there feedback (Voice of the customers)."
good,I thrive in taking care of a team and bringing out the best in people. Training is essential to any job that is worthing doing well.
good,"receive calls, store information and parts into the systems database, stock parts, deliver parts to cars"
good,"Good family atmosphere, lots of training and encouragement by co-workers and management. Great concept, but in the end you are selling cars which is not easy."
good,"Busy ,face paced growing company where you learn about CA DMV regulations and customer service. Management and co workers are hard working."
good,"As customers come into the dealership we are to take them through a process that explains how Carmax is different. We show a damaged vehicle, how to read the tag on the vehicle, and look for vehicles that meat their specific needs. What I learned from working in this car dealership is to ask the best questions to help find the right vehicle for the customer and a few methods on how to overcome objections. The management was always there to help when needed for explaining the reason for a process and to help with the sale of the car. Many of the car sales personal were friendly and willing to help one another. With the method in place to make sure all employees get an opportunity to work with customers relieved much of the stress that could come with being in car sales. The hardest part of the job was overcoming the stipulation of being a used car salesman and that we were a dishonest group. The best part of the job was the flexibility of running your own day. You could schedule your own appointments with customers, make follow up calls when you wanted in a day and working with customers when they did decide on a vehicle. It never failed to see the excitement on their faces when driving away with their new car."
good,"if you've ever wanted a job where, you can get things done with no hassle or rush then this is a perfect place for you. Everyone, well a good majority of people are nice to talk to and enjoy conversation especially when it comes to sports, and or cars of course. They even have occasions when they bring food and who doesn't love FREE food?! if your looking for a nice, calm and relaxed job this is the place to be."
good,It's what you make it.  I was able to get promoted twice and received the necessary training- although this process can be slow but meaningful.  A great place for a second career or an initial one.  Good luck!
good,I loved working there. Team is very friendly. work environment and pay is very good. Manger was very understanding and always gave the right direction to their team.
good,"A decent place to work, but micromanagement is the way that they do things. "
good,Great fast paced work environment. Learn alot about cars and get to drive all types of cars. Hardest part of the job is working in the elements. Most enjoyable part is the cars themselves.
good,"Great manager and team members to work with. Very fast pace, which made the day go by faster. Unfortunately, the pay is low.  Works well for a college student."
good,great place with an even better culture. the teams work together to produce quality cars for the front line customer. The work place is very employee centric and they want you to better yourself
good,"Making service calls for customer to get there car serviced, and vendors schedule to update cars. Make payments to vendors. Sales cars and appy credit for customer to purchases cars. Getting customers want the need and being comfortable in helping them,,"
good,"Really enjoyed working for Carmax at this time, great staff and employees unfortunately I was there for a short time during summer which is the toughest time for car sales."
good,"After 4 years of working here, loving the people, bored of corporate nonsense. Lots of room for development. I started at an entry level position and have had plenty of opportunities to grow."
good,I worked there for 5 years and loved it. I only had one opportunity to move up and they hired someone who wasn't already a part of the company. I had to leave after that because I felt that they didn't care about moving their employees up.
good,Great company. The company actually cared about employees. Chances of advancement was always available. Great co workers who all pulled their weight. I enjoyed that job.
good,"Great company. Awesome benefits. You can make a lot of money, but you have to give up a lot of  time. People always show up on your days off which makes it worst meaning you have to split with somebody else. Other then that. That’s car sales baby."
good,Good place to work if you can deal with lack of leadership. Good company overall and you have great possibilities to get promoted. Sometimes your promotion comes to quick though.
good,"Great company to work for, great people to work with, no work/life balance as to be expected with any sales position. Overall, I don't regret it. You can make a lot of money in a short amount of time if you're willing to put in the hours."
good,"Fun company to work for, and the hours are flexible.  Definitely make the employees feel relaxed, and they do not pressure the staff.  Money is not great, but it is livable."
good,everyone is very supportive. management is very supportive. great company to work for. I enjoy it but sales consultants can not earn enough money to stay if they are serious about a professional sales career. only comms based and comms per unit is very low.
good,Awesome place to work at and very productive. Quick pace and lots to do if not there are some down time activities as well. Only bad thing is the hours either early AM shifts or late Night PM Shifts.
good,Definitely a great first job. Learned and took a great take away from the company and it’s vaules. Managers shouldn’t give false hope to employees. Other than that the company has a great family type environment.
good,"This is a good company, however there are too many requirements to grow, you need to speak in a certain way, deliver feedback in a certain way, follow templates and sometimes there's no room for personal touch."
good,Carmax provides an opportunity for individuals interested in working in the automotive industry to gain experience and knowledge in may different areas.  The hardest part of the job for most is the schedule as the store is open 7 days a week and from morning to night
good,Great place to work you could work at your own pace got payed very well while working here until the end for lack of work to do because it is a comision job.
good,"Good Benefits, Decent Pay, Good People Nothing bad can I say about this company they have the right idea and a good management team to back them up !! Go apply Now !!"
good,"Carmax is a wonderful place to work, a lot of fun and customer interaction, there is a lot of opportunity for advancement and relocation. They offer excellent training. I do however think that the training for managers could be a little stronger, I thunk that the management staff relies too much on partnering with others to make difficult decisions that a manager should be able to make on any level"
good,Carmax is a great company to work for. For starters they provide all the tools necessary to be successfully. I learned a lot from my peers and management. Something that in a traditional dealership they lack in teaching you or any retail job. Listening to customer needs and wants. People are fun and very cheerful. Everyone is there to help.
good,"Great company, and great training.  The training is the best in the auto industry.  Fun environment, that you can leave work everyday with little stress, and a guilt free conscience."
good,"Sales commission based used automobile based business,involved in sales appraisals and financing.Advancement based on customer satisfaction sales.Good company to work for but limited earning potential.Under old corporate structure and CEO a good working environment with goals and advancement,CEO and management change,insensitive program cuts and over staffing led to me leaving the Carmax."
good,"Job is amazing when it comes to meeting new faces daily and having the challenge of finding customers a new car that they'll depend on for years to come. Each customer brings a new story and challenging approach to myself, but I find joy in making someone else's day and seeing their face when they see that car ready for them to drive home."
good,"Realized wasnt the right job for me at the time. But the little time i was there i grew & learned alot about the company & product (Cars). They give an extensive month training, all the co workers are helpful & the managers are amazing mentors. Love the business overall."
good,I love working at carmax it's a very relaxed environment and I enjoy helping others. Managers are cool and give you your space when you need it. I wish the commission was better.
good,"The company culture is fantastic, the benefits are great. Unfortunately, the management is somewhat inconsistent. I have worked under some amazing managers here, and some who are a little more difficult. The best managers seek out and develop talent, find out of the box solutions, and find ways to balance what is best for their organization and what is best for their employees and customers. Mediocre managers fail to recognize and develop talent, and fear making the wrong decision, sometimes to the detriment of win-win solutions. CarMax is a great place to work because mediocrity is about as far down the scale as management tends to go. I have never worked under a truly bad manager there."
good,"My work day started with making copies of the list of people we needed to pull files of. Then I made copies of the info in the files and took this to the different people who needed it that morning. Throughout the day I would either pull old files and box them up to be shredded or we would put up new files that had been brought in to us."
good,"Fortune's Top 100 Companies to Work for 11 years running! Great work environment, great training, a staff that cares about your well being and career!"
good,"well I learned something new every day.With teammates we always had fun and enjoyed our work. Giving coachings to teammates. "
good,Great company to work for! Amazing culture and members. Only downside is to be successful you have to work 6-7 days a week.
good,I have enjoyed working there for the past 14 years. It has been friendly with great employee morale.
good,I like working at CarMax. It is a fun environment and I believe in the company's vision.
good,"Sold cars to customers, so I was responsible in matching my customer with the car of their wants and needs. I learned that by listening to your customer you can almost always satisfy them even if they cannot purchase from you at the time. I worked very closely with my co-workers so when I was not present they would be an advocate for me. I loved the freedom that we had at CarMax to make decisions for our customers and for ourselves. The hardest part of my job was driving over 60 miles one way and not selling anything, but that comes with sales. The best thing of my job was working face to face with my customers. "
good,"It was very easy to meet new people and make friends at Carmax, as the people were very laid back and for the most part happy. Safety and employee needs were of utmost importance, more so than I've seen anywhere else. They take the well being of their associates seriously and encourage development. Management can get political, but nothing too discerning. Overall, I felt that Carmax did value me and would recommend anyone to apply with the necessary skills."
good,fun to work for and you can make a lot of money and you can test drive all types of cars
good,"Overall a good place to work. Recommended for people with a good work ethic and flexible schedules. Management was great, coworkers are friendly and involved."
good,"Good place to work overall.  Great benefits.  Working hours were good. "
good,"Four to an eight-hour shift"
good,I have enjoyed my work experience over the last 7 years.  I'm am just looking for more growth and opportunity in my career. Life work balance could be a little better.
good,I may have only worked at CarMax for 4 months but my leaving had to do with personal issues and nothing to do with CarMax as a company. While the work is hard and expectations can be set high I found my coworkers to be great to work with and helped out everyone as best they could in my location and was proud of all the work we accomplished. The only best feedback I could give is that some of the targets by corporate could at times be a little unrealistic but they always seem to be. Would recommend to anyone regardless of their car knowledge or car experience.
good,Have nothing bad to say about the company. They provide great training and a comfortable environment to learn and grow in. I would recommend to anyone apply.
good,"Wonderful company, but the commission model and the time from beginning of the sale to the customer driving off the lot limits how much you can truly make. All in all I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Fast paced, large amounts of communication in different facets. Not very rewarding so you have to find your own while working long hours. Overall a fun place to work."
good,Car max has a great training program that will get you ready for retail management. the best thing is how there is structure of the day and rules helped to be focused.
good,Each day at work we're reminded of the great customer experience Carmax strives for.  The managers are great at providing feedback and motivating their employees. It's a fun and friendly place to work.
good,"Very cool company.  Filled with intellectual, compassionate individuals.  Unbelievable in a straight comission commission environment.  Genuine care for those who call this home."
good,Carmax was a great environment to work with all the relationships you make with your co-workers and the customers. Loved coming to work to help the customer and spread my knowledge to those sales persons just starting out or needed just a little push for the day.
good,"Good Agenda to learn about the company policy"
good,"Many benefits, ask questions and know what is available to you. Teams are always changing as many people don’t last. The managers also change often but are helpful and you can talk to them."
good,"I learned so much, it was fun and rewarding. This company helped me perfect my sales techniques and management style."
good,"Great benefits , really easy to become successful, honestly the review says average 30k , my first full year I made 55k and I’m currently in one of the tougher markets."
good,"The break room at Carmax is the go to place to unwind, vending machines, coffee, a Kuerig, and even a popcorn maker!! Monthly store wide meetings to acknowledge achievements among different departments."
good,"Great environment, culture and people. The pay was too low. I had to work two jobs to pay bills as a single person in Kennesaw. The lack of opportunity for advancement is low."
good,CarMax is a great place to work with excellent benefits however if you are a sales associate work/life balance can be difficult. It is required that you work most weekends.
good,"Working at Carmax has been great for me! I started as a part time employee and worked full time during the summer between semesters during college. Great working environment, supportive managers, excellent training, and fun for guys like me that like cars."
good,CarMax is a Great place to learn and grow as a sales professional. The company has endless opportunities for those who seek them and can afford you a solid lifestyle of you succeed as a consultant.
good,"I’m a fleet driver, I have a awesome manager! My base salary should be $42,500 a year but I have already made over $40,000.( 5 months still in this year ) Most drivers work as a team and we are like family. I have  a schedule that I work 7 days out of 14, so I have a ton of down time. Also the best thing about driving for carmax is I get to go home “EVERY NIGHT!”"
good,"This is one of the best companies to work for. The commission was lower than others but the volume of customers that you see is awesome. Great leadership team, always looking to develop consultants and managers."
good,"It is a different type of atmosphere from most dealerships, less pressure and they let you work with the customer without taking over and we don't hide nothing from the customer and we can be honest and integrity is very important to me and working at CarMax I get to retain my integrity and look the customer in the eye and know that I am doing my best to make it the best car buying experience they have ever had. I believe in the Carmax ways and philosophy and I support how they treat everyone and one the same."
good,"Employee and manager relations were really great. It felt like a family and very welcoming. Everybody helped me out when I was learning my new role.The workplace culture was good and they celebrated every holiday, we decorated the office and made themes. Outside of work we did team building exercises."
good,"weekdays are very busy work wise, but everyone works together to get the work done, its a relaxed environment especially with all the friendly co workers from all departments, the hardest part would have to be working the gate just because of all the truck drivers that come at you at once, but for the most part they are friendly, patient and helpful. overall fun job if youre optimistic and easy going."
good,"It was a great place to work, my co-workers enjoyed life outside of work. I had a great relationship with my managers they were understanding when I needed to step away to finish school."
good,Was a great place to work with great people when I worked there 4 years ago. You will need to put in quite a few hours to be successful. It will be worth it.
good,"A typical day at work involved resolving customer issues, driving customer loyalty."
good,"With flexible schedules, I was able to attend school and complete bba and mba, and take care of my family. They provide tuition assistance. With multiple ping pong tables and multiple places to spend your lunch time, life is manageable. Hardest part is they may not appeal to your culture, but the enjoyable part is they accommodate cultural differences and welcome change."
good,You enjoy the people you work with . The face -paced environment and the professionalism of others is 5 stars.  Enjoy what I do on a daily basis .  Sincerely Alexandria Katherine Marie Cochran.
good,Great place to work. Happiness depends on your managers. Every co-worker is great. Work hard and pay is great. Awesome benefits. Only hires 2% applicants
good,"A great opportunity learning from the experts on car sales.  They provide you with all the necessary knowledge to buy a car, to sale a car, to estimate the cost of repairing a car for up to standard condition before going to the sales gallery."
good,"Enjoyed working there the short time I did. Very relaxed environment and enjoyed the part of no haggling prices when it came to the car sales. Overall, great company to work for."
good,"I liked working for Carmax. It's fun, extremely fast paced and there's never a dull moment. Carmax offers excellent 401K benefits and free lunches too - can't beat that."
good,"brand to incite excitement about the company's mission and values."
good,"Carmax is a GREAT employer with TONS of vertical potential, but because they are opening so many stores, the employees are stretched too thin in some locations.  Many stores are understaffed to compensate for the opening of new stores.  Many departments require employees to move (temporarily or permanently) depending on business needs in other stores."
good,"Basic sales Strategy."
good,It really depends upon who & what department you work for.   This started out as a part time job for in the store.  It's now excelled to 10+ years with the company.
good,"I greatly enjoy my position at CarMax. As long as you stay on top of your opportunities, you can do very well. Business can change with seasons and it is difficult work during slower periods."
good,"Learned how to work with ppl, long hrs, but great money with limited education.You will learn great customer service, or you will not survive. Good place to work but somewhat cut throat, but I never worked @ a sales place that wasn't."
good,"Not a bad place to work at all. CarMax sets the bar for the auto sales industry. Their motto of no haggle pricing, no pressure is exactly why this company continues to grow. worked here for 2 years. Hope to be able to go back"
good,A typical day at work working in the inventory department getting prep call ups from the sales department  vacuuming  cleaning interior outside of the vehicle use tire shine for tires
good,I loved everything about CarMax. I cant really find a bad thing to say about them. I was just over worked in the serviced center and needed a change with my hours.
good,I'd recommend CarMax as a place to shop and a place to work in a heartbeat. It's a company that really tries to take care of its people. Plus they love to feed their employees! It felt like family.
good,"Continuous training on vital behaviors, CarMax is always looking to improve as company. The working environment is laid back, but very busy at peak hours."
good,Great company and they will train you how to be a leader. I recommend this company for anyone who is looking to move up and does not have a lot of leadership experience. They will give you the tools you need to move forward.
good,"After working here for over four years I have found it very educational. This was my first job and they are very willing to train people with no prior experience in finance and DMV processing. As a part-timer, they worked well with my school schedule and even offer a tuition reimbursement program. Everyone is very friendly and the environment is upbeat and light. Managers care about you as a person and will help you reach your goals in a timely manner."
good,"loved working time goes by pretty fast."
good,"Very positive work environment & climate. Daily,continual training with much room for advancement. Each dayI learned many new things even after being employed 3 years. The most enjoyable part of my job was guiding customers through the whole vehicle buying process and especially helping those with challenged credit to secure a much needed vehicle. The work culture at Carmax generated a team approach among employees."
good,"Carmax is an excellent place to work, the only down fall is promotions. Promotions are based on seniority vs skill. THe training is never ending which is a good thing, great place for car lovers."
good,enjoyed working for carmax its a fortune 500 company so anyone would be lucky to become a team member. its a very safe and productive workplace with the company of friendly helpful managers. wouldnt mind working again. 10 out of 10
good,"As a part time sales associate, I have enjoyed the work here.  Great management, great support. The hours are very flexible and the work is very honest."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the visible effort from all the departments to help build a better culture for the associate and a better experience for the customers. I appreciate all the associate development I received during my career at CarMax.
good,For a single person CarMax is a great place to work. If you have a family don't expect to support it if your spouse is not working. For the amount of work required at CarMax the pay is not enough to support a family household.
good,Great company to work for fun and fast paced.  Seems like there was opportunity for advancement if it would have been followed thru with management.
good,a typical day at work would be very calm but yet fast pace environment every day you learn the progress that the company makes the managers are very nice and are encouraging on going to school. the people you work with are fun and nice. the hardest part of this job would be the long days when theres a bunch of work to be done. over all the best part of the job would be me being able to attend school and them working with my schedule
good,"CarMax has now been Fortune 500 top 100 company's to work for 9 years in a row.  This company focusses on developing its employees; which is great.  The pay is replaces by a very flexible environment, with a casual dress code (jeans allowed M-F), work/family balance, quarterly fun, and relaxed environment.  This is the best company that I have ever worked for."
good,"Great place to work, flexible schedule, and great benefits."
good,Daily tasks include managing a team of four individuals to ensure maximum customer support while creating an efficient and fun atmosphere to work in. Duties also include balancing customer expectations with internal associate capabilities.
good,"CarMax is a great place to work full time or part time. It just isn't great for a high school student with a busy schedule. It is not your average car sales, it actually is the way buying a car should be. No negotiating prices, no waiting hours and hours, straight and to the point, with very friendly faces. Management is there to help you in every way, and give you room to learn on your own, at your own pace."
good,"Your day will begin with positive meetings with your managers and fellow sales consultants. Your schedule is generous, full of opportunity to earn money."
good,"I typed, processed and completed paperwork. I was also responsible for allocating parts for vehicles. I learned a new work industry that's related to Automotives. Management was excellent they were their when you needed them they made me feel comfortable for me to addres any issues I had. I made a bestfriend in my work area."
good,Top company to work for. Great work life balance. Company culture is the best I have ever been a part of and integrity is a real value not just a word.
good,Carmax is amazing company to work for. Lots of room for growth and you can take it as far as you want. People and managers care and enjoy working with you.  Pay is okay that's the only downfall.
good,Ive gained most of my customer service/ call center experience here. It was a great way to get my foot in the door so I can start my career. They gave me a chance.
good,"Has been a phenomenal place to work, managers very helpful, excited about changes that are coming with Omni Channel. Really enjoy speaking and building relationships with customers in order to help them get into or sell a vehicle"
good,"A good place to work, great people. They do tend to move people around a lot and work-life balance is a struggle,"
good,"The culture at CarMax is amazing. Associates are helpful and always willing to assists you in your learning and advancement. Management is not as hands on as the could be. However, they do make themselves availability when requested by associate."
good,"Good management, good people, great environment. The work culture is outstanding. The supervisors are very understanding and very helpful. Very relaxed atmosphere."
good,Such an easy job with great pay. There’s always something to. Coworkers are such great people. Everyone gets along. Carmax in general is a great place wether you’re an associate or just a customer shopping around for a car.
good,Carmax was voted Fortunes 100 Best Places to Work. The atmosphere is very calming. Unlike your traditional dealership which is always fast paced and pushy.
good,"Its easy work for great pay you jjst have to put in the work. Everyone works as a team. Managers understand you have a personal life. Carmax it self make it easy for you to sell cars, especially with the reputation they have. I call it a candy shop of cars!"
good,Best company I've ever worked for. They are great with boosting employee morale and encouraging employees to move up within the company. Great benefits and good pay
good,"Carmax is actually a great company to work for. Lots of perks and incentives, ranging from employee plus immediate family car discounts to perks-at-work offers and discounts. Environment is very positive and pleasant to be in. Management team are very caring and overall supportive to the success of each position. I worked as a sales consultant, lots of opportunities to make great money although it’s a commission based job and there is pressure to do well in order to make the money to be comfortable to live well. Great thing is there are usually bonus programs in which extra money can be made in addition to the standard commission pay already set in place.  Overall good job but you have to work extra hard or else you can struggle financially!! "
good,"i loved working at carmax, job was fun, culture was great but my direct manager was a perverted pig and if your were boosting his ego you got the horrible schedule and hours. he would make horridly inappropriate comments and the shifts with him there were uncomfortable."
good,"Other then very poor management, definatly recommend applying. Great benefits, flexible with your schedule if part time and going to school. Good pay."
good,I learned a lot in this company and had a lot of fun working with people that's worked there. I enjoyed every minute working here and I would recommend to anyone
good,"CarMax is in the middle of a total transformation to an omni-channel retailer.  The culture is product oriented, with delivery the top priority.  The pace is fast, the work is exciting.  Be prepared to change often, and be flexible about work conditions and team structures.  Best suited to people who enjoy change and rapidly evolving business strategies.  Ample opportunity for growth and training, plenty of perks of benefits."
good,"I worked at Carmax for a little over 2 years as a Sales Associate. As a Veteran this place was a great place to work. I won multiple awards and was a mentor to the new sales staff. The only thing that is hard , You work weekends. and sometimes you work long hours and long nights. Management was good, they cared about you making money. The job is great when its busy. Good Money, Good benefits . I left for a goverment job, due to me being prior military. But I loved the atmosphere and the people. I would recomend this job to anyone who can dedicate their time. Perfect job for someone who doesnt have kids yet."
good,I love the culture here at CarMax as long as you have a good manager. I may be looking to go back. in comparison to other companies they are good you do have to work Sundays however every maybe 4th or 5th weekend you go have off . And again  having a good manager that's relatable makes a big difference.
good,"The pay is terrible. Other than that management was fantastic, if they have to talk to you about sales they will ask what can they do to help you reach the goals."
good,Company strives to be competitive yet fair.  Drives forward innovation to maintain a constant presence in the eyes of the customer while maintaining a simple process.
good,You are motivated to continuously develop your skills and challenge your opportunity to exceed goals.  Shoulder to shoulder development with managers at all levels helps maintain a focus on growth and excitement to be rewarded to effort put into your development.
good,"When I started CarMax I was welcomed by the whole company, they where very patient in my learning process. After 3 months I was already taking over management responsibilities, this is a great company if you would like the opportunity to move up in a company."
good,Not very realistic on phone procedures.  Only job I have ever been released from. It was un fair. I believe I followed rules that were set. 3 years and doing very well? I was shocked to say the least.
good,"There is so much freedom at this job, whether you're in sales or in the production side. The only con to that, if any, is you are held accountable for your own income or the work load. In sales you can choose to not work but you won't make commission, if you're in production you will get back flow and have more work to do that you put off. "
good,I loved the majority of my time working at CarMax! There was a huge team mentality that really helped growth. You get a very clear idea the you are cared about as an employee.
good,"A typical day for a full time Sales Associate might be starting at 9am, or 12 pm.  Carmax is big on training, so once a week there is a group huddle, and once a month or so, they will put out a new training video to help hone your skills."
good,"CarMax really cares about their employees.  They have coffee and tea everyday at no charge.  They also have medical supplies like band aids  aspirin, and antacids in the supply cabinet."
good,"They care more about the employee than any other place I have worked. Management was nice and really seemed to listen. Pay could have been a bit better. Sometimes management weren't on the same page, but they usually fixed it. Overall, I would recommend it."
good,Good Environment to work. Management minimal understanding of employee Health Status. Leaned multiple task and and operations. Having to deal with after market installed products. Having to go home to family at the end of the day.
good,"CarMax is a company built on integrity for its employees and customers alike. It expects it from their employees and desires an experience for its customers that far exceeds industry standards."
good,"If you want to work for a company that values your effort, Carmax is the place. From the top down, management encourages a culture of developing those who work with, for and under your supervision."
good,"Worked there for almost two years, loved it and hopefully I can be considered for re hire but I had to quit due to a car accident and couldnt make it out to kennesaw anymore. Loved the job overall, sometimes itll get busy around hurricane time, but the worst part was management and high turn over. And customer service was the busy department that paid the least but other departments paid more and were slower"
good,"Generally a good place to work. People generally upbeat. Profits and bonuses were shared with EVERYONE, not just managers. We were paid while the store was closed for 1 week for the last hurricane. The few minuses would be: too structured. Every move you make-they'res a rule/guideline. You actually CAN be fired for taking from the trash can. Tools are supplied, but disappear/break often and are slow to be replaced. I often brought my own in from home to finish a job, and wondered if I would be fired for stealing when I tried to leave the building with my own tool at day's end."
good,As a young adult working at Carmax as a Sales Consultant was a completely different environment. Carmax has taught me so much. Things that I can use in my personal life and professional life. I appreciate all of the opportunities and enhancements.
good,Great company to work for. They are very organized and care about the members that work for our company as well as the customers. I like how they recongnize associates for doing well. They also help develop yoh
good,"Production oriented workplace,  fast paced, not a lot of free time. Most employees and management are friendly and dedicated to quality work. Lots of activities are provided.. some team building activities are fun, some are not."
good,"My original manager was excellent our lines of communication was open and my training and learning about the culture was clear and on track. The teams were unbalanced so I ended up being moved from the team that the gentleman that recruited me was running. My new manager was not very good at communication and requested that I restart my training that would have been completed because i wasn't on his team when I had done it, that does affect your pay and things went downhill from there. Overall though, a great company with a mostly great team."
good,"The team at Carmax Littleton, CO was a great place to work.  I learned a lot about sales.  To my surprise, I'm able to use the discovery method when in a new situation either professionally or personally."
good,"carmax is a great place to work. indeed i saw why it was named one of the top 100 places to work in America. fast-paced work environment, yet very fun to be in and great staff, great culture of training and human resources does a great job."
good,"Good place to work and grow as an employee. Room for advancement, but not always. Working with customers every day can be a pain and great at the same time. As a customer specialist, it is really nice to be able to perform all the roles to help the customers."
good,"Always on your feet and work to be done, good pay and benefit options, ability to grow within the company, good starting pay, on the job training, good management"
good,A typical day at work at Carmax was fun and for the most part enjoyable. All the departments are typically on the same page and works as a team.  I learned a lot at Carmax< I started in sales and moved around to reconditioning and almost a mechanic but there where no openings in my area. Management at Carmax was really great My only issues with that pared with work place culture is that Carmax is a “zero confrontation” work place wich means that some employees can get away with being extremely lazy and unprofessional without reprimand. The hardest part of my two positions “sales and reconditioning” was the weather.  The weather dictates productivity. The most enjoyable part of the job was really making a family at the work place and helping people.
good,was good fast pace job i had 2 to 3 managers made life stressfull at time. Pay was not as good as other shops But they have one of the best Benefits in automotive. 401 k
good,"A breath of fresh air. Everyone across every team is as dedicated as the next person. Of course, some work place drama here and there but that comes with the hiring of people straight out of high school, or college people. "
good,"There's a job here for virtually anyone, whether you want to be the face of the company or the back bone. My only dissatisfaction with the CarMax I worked at, was the management. They do not care if you call in  one hour, two hours, even three hours before your shift to let them know you'll be a little late, they do not care, and they will chastise you for that. The thing is, learn to use your resources from the computer, not the people that work there too."
good,"Great place to work, Low stress, excellent career opportunities. Low pay unless you are living with your parents or a manager level and up. I would recommend this to any college student or new grad. You can make a career at Carmax."
good,"A great place to work and they took the time to train you for the job! Great interaction with sales force, a great team environment, hours were great for a part-time job."
good,"CarMax has the BEST work envirment you could imagine for sales. The people they hire are truely the best. The ONLY downside is they should pay us mrore for what we do. However, they do truely set you up to succeed. There are lots of fun benifits such as if you sell certian numbers of cars you can get rewarded, but there is no pressure. Pressure is to maintain the BEST customer service for our customers possible- if that means selling them a car or not."
good,"as an inventory associate, i can say this is an enjoyable company. i feel that inventory is a little underpaid for what they do, but overall a great place to work"

good,Fast paced environment. Room to grow in any department you work for. Depending on your job you maybe outside a lot.  Feedback driven company. Good management

good,I have been a sales consultant for Carmax for 10 years. The company continues to grow and there are plenty of opportunities if you are willing to relocate. The company is a fortune 100 best companies to work for. It's stays consistent in customer traffic for the majority of the year. Benefits  are good.
good,The job was easy and as long as you worked hard you would make  good money. There is a lot of micro managing going on but it is ignored because of the perks and other employees.
good,Good work/life balance and great culture of people.  Started as a part-time position and has progressed into many years of growth and opportunities to learn new things.

good,"This company shows it's employees their value by offering great benefits, great initial training and continued training. It is one of the few places you can walk in and see everyone smiling. The hardest part of the job for me was going from a Monday through Friday job to a more unpredictable schedule."
good,"I have worked for this company in the business office for almost three years and its been great, I did not need any prior experience they were able to train me in all the tasks in about 4 months. There is a lot of opportunity to move up in the company. You are even able to switch to other departments easily if you have the interest to do so. Highly recommend this company if you are a college student looking for full or part time work they work with your schedule."
good,The company is awesome but do not apply for the Fredericksburg store management is terrible. The operations manager will fire you for no reason and holds personal vandetas on you. The line production managers will not have your back do not trust them. The other members of leadership aren't to bad just keep your head down and don't get in trouble and stay away from the operations manager.
good,It was always a busy work environment where I really had the chance to learn a lot from my fellow employees and the management.The camaraderie that existed at Carmax made the tough task of working on some of cars much easier. The hardest part of the job was flexible schedules.

good,Sold high end vehicles/ Loved this job and it was great because i was always trying to help individual get them an comfortable car that they can afford.
good,Outbound calls in a call center to customers auto accounts that are 1-39 days past due. I learned how to Negotiate payments arrangements to bring account(s) current. Management team and co-workers nice. Hardest part of job was hours swing shift and sometime weekends. Monthly department meetings were fun.
good,As long as you are willing to work hard to complete your task early it is a relaxed environment. Management values your opinion.
good,"Over my 4+ years at Carmax the company proved to be an awesome place to work where employees have clear expectations. Was able to move around and advance in the company. Given you are able to complete what is expected of you at work, advancement is dependent on openings on a seniority level. If you go above and beyond Carmax is always opening new opportunities for management roles. Benefits are great and employee  happiness is best I've worked with."
good,"A typical day at work consist of responding to customer emails and phone calls in reference to their vehicle purchase.  Persuasion, communication and connecting to customer is a is a huge key to this job.  Helping customers with their vehicle selections is what I love doing.  We work as a team selling vehicles and solution to our customers.  The hardest part would Persuasion.  Showing a customer the benefits of the vehicle selected.

The work environment is great fast paced and provide their employees with a friendly work environment. I can say that Carmax is a stress free zone to work for. They provide their employees with great training and benefits and everyone is treated with respect. The hardest part of the job for me was the work hours. It was never a set schedule. I need something steady being that I have a child to attend to whom has activities out side of school and it was hard to attend with the work schedule."
good,I great and help customers find the right car for them. I help them with all financing and delivery of their car.
good,I left because of poor management in the south Jordan store was treated like a slave
good,"Great concept should be the norm. Good atmosphere, great with dependability."
good,"We worked as a group washing car, checking incoming and outgoing vehicles, inspect merchandise. I learned how to detail cars, check inventory and database. Management was awesome till a recent change.  My manager looked out for his employees. my co workers were very free spirited and energetic. we were a very well oiled machine. the hardest part of the day was the weather condition. Greensboro weather was very unpredictable.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the different type of cars i got to work on.  Being an auto tech head its every mechanics dream."
good,"I have never had a company shape me the way CarMax has. Not just having the ability to work my way up, but having managers that were able to recognize, hone, and promote my talents was a big part of what I loved and still love about the company. I have made what I consider some of my best friends at this company, and the networking opportunities I've gained just through people and vendors and coworkers have been amazing. Working around vehicles and with people truly made going in enjoyable. If I had to have one complaint it would be that while advancement was a great thing at this position, sometimes it could be pushed aside by managers with different views. "
good,"always fun and exciting when coming to work, interaction with great people, free lunch twice a week,"
good,Great company to work for . Some of the best people and the training is top notch.
good,"I'd work 7pm to 7am every Monday through Thursday. This allowed me to get 44 hours a week and still have a three day weekend which I thought was pretty awesome. The people I worked with were great to work with and friendly. Always had a positive environment were you could make yourself feel at home at. When you went to work everyday, although there are managers there, they're not constantly looking over you to see if you're doing the right thing, at CarMax they trust you enough to let you go off and do the work you need to at the pace you feel comfortable at. The hardest part of the job was making sure the vehicle's maintained or exceeded the company's quality standards. Most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that you had no set breaks, you could break when you felt was right. Also you got to drive pretty sweet cars."

good,"fast paced, great training, monthly review, one on one's with management, open door policy, fun, customer friendly, family atmosphere and always ready to listen to the opinions of the staff"
good,"Great work environment that allowed you to practice various communication skills on a daily basis. I worked with a lot of great individuals who gave me not only lessons for the job, but life lessons as well. Work and life balance was the only thing that I had a problem with because we were forced to work on Saturdays as well as Sundays."
good,"I would say the culture is very diversified! I love the people I work with, it’s a lot of work and it’s constantly busy. If you are a great multitasker and learn quick this job will fit you. There will be times when management is flustered because they are under pressured, but don’t let that get to you! Overall, it’s a good company to work for."
good,I enjoyed working for carmax for a short period of time. My only complaint is that it can sometimes be hard for employees to advance in the company. Not the greatest communication between departments at times.
good,"Training, support, and encouragement are top-notch!  Additionally, teammates, colleagues, were supportive and willing to help.  I really enjoyed the people and the work."
good,"My take home is projected to be about $34K this year, but I've made several thousands in my 401 K and in tuition reimbursement. You can't be lazy on this job. And if you don't know how to handle a customer situation someone will walk you through and give advice."

good,"Great place to work! The atmosphere is relaxed and your success or failure rests in your hands. The company however, provides employees with all the resources to succeed."
good,The management was the best part about working here as they treat you as a human rather than another body. Management always had your back if you were in the right no matter the situation. The fellow employees are super friendly and easy to get along with as they are very accepting. The only downside was the some of the rude customers that try to manipulate you but employees are there to back you up. This location taught me everything from money procedures to customer interactions all while enjoying coming to work everyday. I was a part time employee so I was not eligible for the numerous benefits they offer from medical to retirement.
good,"Fantastic management, great culture and benefits. They truly care about their employees just as much as customer experience, you feel part of a family and you are heard."
good,The sales consultant has no commission cap. unlimited earning potential. Fastrack to manager position available upon performance.long days if you put in extra work for sales.
good,"8 he plus work days."
good,"Great place to work. I would highly recommend it . Great training and environment. If you don't like a desk job and like to keep moving , you will love this job."
good,"I loved working at CarMax. I would most definitely work there again if needed. Great Management. Fun environment. Overall great experience with CarMax in Tampa, FL."
good,Carmax is a great company to work for! You sometimes get free lunches and breakfasts. They even have events that take place outside of work as well!!!
good,"Great Company to work for with lots advancement opportunities. Great Management Love the volunteer events they do for the community as team builder for the company. Very versatile co-  workers in extremely different fields that just decided to try Car Sales."

good,"Carmax was a great place to work with friendly, helpful and ;positive staff.  A typical day at work started at 9AM with Staff Meeting and goals for the day.  With many different cultures represented in the Staff we all worked together to resolve any issues and became a cohesive team and  helped each other when needed.  "
good,Great place to work. Shift hours can seem long especially with the 12-9pm shift but everyone shares those times fairly. Great training program and very responsive management

good,"Great Company to work for. Great work environment with an amazing inventory to offer a very "
good,"Clean"
good,"Overall my experience working at Carmax was very positive. The experience wasn’t always shared with coworkers, but not everyone can be pleased. Carmax can be a great place to work, but in my experience it can be very hard to move up not impossible but hard."
good,"Customer Service is Key when working here. That is #1. I have learned alot about the Sales aspect and the Inventory or Operations side as well. Workplace culture is great, where else can you wear shorts and sneakers everyday. Most enjoyable part is the team work and the Hardest part is keeping customers happy"

good,I love working at Carmax because it opened the door into the automotive field for me.  I am looking to continue to learn more about the automotive industry even though I have a vast knowledge just from working at Carmax.
good,Carmax focuses a lot of effort on developing associates and making sure they are happy. They hire for most positions with no experience necessary because of their thorough on-the-job-training system. Tools and equipment are provided by the company.
good,"a learning career on selling of cars and meeting of many people in the way they want in the car they are buying, The set price of the car you are trying to sell , no hassle . They were willing to work with you."
good,"There are great people there and they really try to work on your development. As a buyer's assistant you spend most of your day outside, no matter the weather. This job is not for you if you don't like working outside."
good,"Wonderful place to work with amazing co workers and customers. You are on your feet a lot during your working hours, tend to test drive vehicles at times in 100 plus degree heat."
good,"The culture at CarMax is collaborative, and when it comes to selling cars they are the best. However, to maximize your income and not give up sales, you come early and stay late. Its your choice because they do give you two days off. But most all of us who exceeded our goals we come in on our days off. You can give splits and many Sales Associates do that, but none the less to maximize your income you try not too. I loved the CarMax Cares volunteer program and the social aspects. Great communication, phenomenal training and excellent benefits. Just hated the hours."
good,"I can only speak for the Knoxville location. Everyone works together towards one goal. My concerns have always been listened to and addressed even if it wasn't to my benefit, but never just brushed under the rug. You can find something to complain about at every company but in my opinion if you are honest and hard working at Carmax you can move up in the company. Benefits are good and I highly recommend the Knoxville location for employment."

good,Carmax is a decent place to work. I will recommend this job to people who are not lazy and are ambitious to make money and offer great customer service.
good,"This was my first job ever, aside from volunteering at other places. My overall experience was great because it didn't feel like work. I learned how to multitask better, as well as work with people as a team. I was working for a summer basketball youth program through the CarMax company. A typical work day included setting up for basketball games, making sure each team had jerseys and meal tickets, and if we were low on staff I would help work the time clocks and stat book. Management was good, both of my supervisors were great teachers and helped me whenever I needed it. The hardest part of my job was when we were low on staff and I had to pay attention to the clock and write stats at the same time. Getting free food was probably the best part about this job, aside from making friends with my co-workers."
good,relaxed fast pace environment. management is great to work for. work life balance is definitely there. would recommend to anyone for work place. awesome

good,I enjoyed working here. The atmosphere was friendly and welcoming. The scheduling was flexible and fair. There were many opportunities to advance. The sales pressure was tolerable.
good,I love working at carmax because of my fellow associates. It is very fast paced and I have learned a lot. The benefits are pretty good. The environment is great.
good,"Work directly with vendors throughout Houston including various Auto Dealers. Active Accounts Payable representative, Pay bill invoices and file accordingly. Reconcile Company Assetts, and Perform monthly budget/ESP Warranty/Accessory Reports Daily. Schedule incoming appointments for Service."
good,CarMax is a company which exceeds my expectations with excellent associate consideration. Working as a Part Time sales consultant the pay is phenomenal but requires your effort in achieving. Even if you have no sales experience the goal of CarMax consultants isn't to sell a vehicle but to identify your customers needs and recommend vehicles that achieves that. You are their guide through the simple sales process and to help find the vehicle that is perfect for them.
good,"Customer Service Specialist 1. "
good,"CarMax is one of the best companies I have worked for. They take excellent care of their employees, provide strong benefits, and are happy to provide training to help each employee reach their career growth goals."
good,"Carmax is an exceptionally ethically grounded place of employment. They continue to place their employees in the highest regard. Working here was an honor and a pleasure. Although the potential for advancement through the company was prevalent, I was not interested in relocation, which is an essential piece into moving upward in the company."
good,"I started at CarMax as a customer and I needed a job that would work with my class schedule. CarMax was the place for me. I was hired as an Inventory Associate, and quickly found my way  to serving as one of the leaders of my department. I enjoy my job interaction with all of the departments. I'm able to handle all types of communication. A typical work day involves the daily goal of inspecting cars to meet our company's criteria. We work daily with transportation of our store's inventory throughout the nation, and along with wholesale dealers. The hardest part of my job is sometime dealing with the task of doing 20 jobs at once, but I have managed to do that well."
good,"Diagnostics and electrical repair ,inspect and repair of makes & models of all vehicles, trucks and diesels, training of other technicians, training of up to date new technology ."
good,Business Office is by far the best position to work while working for Carmax. Friendly and caring fellow employees. Never a dull moment.
good,"I loved the people I worked with, the customers were overall awesome, and the management team was very supportive.  The commission structure left a lot to be desired, which is why I had to leave the job.  I could not live on what I was pulling in every two weeks with this structure"
good,Productive place to work. Busy company with many employees and much to learn. Paying attention to details was a big deal.
good,An absolutely amazing place to work for. Truly didn't feel like work. Family atmosphere with many open door policies for conflict resolution if ever there was one.
good,"First arrived at CarMax revealed to me a different working environment then I was used to from other mechanical repair shops. The atmosphere gives support from managers who show interest in your development as a person and within your career. There is in place at my store a great system driven by the technicians that gives great experience support and team work. If you don't know or have any experience with a certain repair or problem, the technicians there are always quick to help and jump in. "
good,"Exceeding customer expectations. Able to apply all of my skill sets and experiences."
good,The managers here actually care about the employees. They will make sure you have everything you need to do a good job. Good benefits. Good pay. I loved working here.
good,"Awesome people that you are sorrounded by, great  place to work at and easy to learn how to take control of things. Great managing team, great inventory and very correct people to work with"
good,"Job training is complete and walks you through as many situations as possible. "
good,"Habiendo trabajado, hace ya vrios años, aún conservo grandes recuerdos acerca de las condiciones laborales y beneficios para el trabajador."
good,"CarMax was probably one of my favorite places to work. I loved interacting with my customers. The team was very pleasant, and everyone worked together to provide an exceptional customer service experience to customers."
good,"This is a sales job without micro-management and a culture of supporting/training and not pressure/stress.  Carmax takes major lengths to train you how to sell their way and represents exactly why and how successful that is.  Your ceiling on how much you can make is dependent on how well you're able to pick up the training and how much time you're willing to put in.  At the lowest end, you'll make $30k year, at the highest end $100k ... a good sales consultant will average $45k year.  Only the hours you're listed is what's expected of you, but you can always put in whatever extra you desire (the more time, the more money you'll make, of course).  Training never stops with Carmax.  The sole job of the sales manager interaction with you is to help you become the best salesperson you can possibly be.  There's never pressure, just helping you improve on opportunities and celebrating your strengths."
good,"Great job atmosphere, friendly, helpful and attentive to the customers needs. Going above and beyond your job to have customer satisfaction. Winters are hard to work through but overall the best place I have worked at. I regret resigning my position there due to personal issues. I recommend to work and or purchase your next vehicle from here."
good,Hard work and annoying truck drivers. But I love the manangment. Its a great place to work. You have ur ocassion annoying co-workers. The hardest part is prepping
good,No two days are the same. We are always challenged to provide a world class experience.
good,I really enjoyed working for CarMax. They were a great company that gave plenty of opportunity to earn more per hour and to move up or around the company as you wanted. My management was good but also intimidating and not overly friendly. I learned how to take care of cars properly and how to park and drive in every situation.
good,"Great pay, benefits and open door policy.  Self nominating company for advancement opportunities."
good,CarMax is probably the greatest entry point for commission sales. They provide a thorough training throughout your career and have a consistent stream of customers.
good,Carmax is the first car dealership i've ever worked at and I was surprised with how friendly and kind the atmosphere is. They focus on personal development more than just how many cars you sell. I worked there for over a year part-time while finishing up my degree and they easily worked with my school schedule.
good,"Overall, CarMax is s great place to work. They put a lot of time into manager training so they are competent when the time comes. Advancement in the company is easy. If you show leadership ability and ambition, they will give you more responsibilities. In time, they might put your name in for manager training. "
good,"I really enjoy working here! The people I work with are really fun and  the work always have something new for you to learn. The only downside is the development and commitment from managers. I just wish that my current manager would commitment to their word of have me move forward with my management career. I work hard for my BA to help me get the career I want, but that does not seem to matter with this company. But this does not speak for all locations. It just depends on the manager at certain locations. The pay could be a little better as well."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for CarMax. I spent almost 3 years with the company and I truly loved the work I did. A typical day at work was opening or closing the store, counting drawers for set up and for closing at night, assisting customers with understanding paperwork when they bought and sold a car, and sending title paperwork to the state of both Illinois and Wisconsin. I answered a multi-line phone system, took payments for vehicles and for service work, and I also would work on keeping files organized and clean. I also put cars purchased at auctions into the system and called auction houses regarding titles. I created files with stock numbers as well. I learned a lot of great customer service skills in the position."
good,I have loved everyday at Carmax. Just looking to get into a industry so I can continually grow in my sales career. 
good,"There isn't a dull moment working at CarMax. with the company being ver successful and growing continually, you are always on your feet and managing your time. i learned how to multitask very well and to move with a sense of purpose. The postion i held was very important and detailed. Like i said before you are always on your feet. Certains things needed to get done and we as Inventory Associates had to carry out the plan of attack as fast and accurately as possible. The managers that wrok at CarMax are very knowledgeable. You could go to them for just about anything and they take good care of their employees. They have my utmost respect mainly for their dedication to their company. Positive attitude, their constant care for their employees, and their hard work are what a manager is all about and they definitely set the example. We all work as a team and i highly stress that word because everything cannot get accomplished with jus one person. The co-workers there have your back and we also discuss different matters so we can figure out how to complete the goal the best way possible. Like the managers, your talking to one another on a constant basis. For me personally the hardest part is leaving work feeling i got everything done that i was supposed to. im an overachiever so i like to always do more at anytime possible. This is why i say theres never a dull moment. There is ALWAYS something to do no matter what so sometimes its a bit hard to tell myself that i did the best i could do. Being with other employees who want to come up in the company jus as much as the next person"
good,A great place to work and begin a career. Everyone is very helpful and friendly. Management is the best! Everyone gives and gets recognition as well as constructed ways to improve your job.
good,"I love my job here. This is a great company to work for and I love my job here. My coworkers are great, the management is very focused on associate development, and the company culture is fantastic."

good,I really enjoyed working at CarMax. Enjoyed working with all the different dealerships and bodyshop
good,Your work day goes by fast because it is a fast pace environment.
good,"You have to be serious and dedicated to make it in this industry. There is so much room to succeed. The training is great! The people are awesome!! You have to have a family orientation and focused mind when doing this. It is a Fortune 500 Company, but should definitely be in the Top 100. Your co-workers will feel like family. There is nothing hard about this job aside from learning that everyone is not going to buy a car from you."
good,"My typical day at work varies because I work in a fast-paced environment. Overall, I support the team as well as perform task specifally assigned to me. I also handle escalated customer service issues. My hardest part of my job is when I am unable to find a win-win resolution for the company and our customers. There are times when our policies do not allow us give the customer exactly what they want. In most cases we are able to provide a win-win resolution but in the instances when we are unable to meet the customers needs you don't feel the same sense of accomplishment. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with. When working in an environment when everyone is a team player it makes you love what you do."
good,Great place to work. Great culture. Fast paced. Tons of room for advancement. Can move anywhere in the country if needed. Excellent benefits. Diversity. Lots of paid time off. Lots of community volunteering available . This company also donates a lot to the community each location is in

good,"I had a ball working there, from the people to management to all the pros and cons it was alot of fun. There were many perks and great things in working for Carmax plus the feeling you get helping people get into newly used cars!"
good,"In a Cross Functional store, Its no place for anyone much over fifty. In a larger store older can make it.  The schedule involves doing EVERY (YES EVERY)  job in the store over a six week rotation"
good,Typical day at work would consist of pulling work off computer. Walk car for any additional damage. Have supervisor approve any additional work then I would repair damage and refinish. Must keep equipment maintained. Great workplace ethics. Volunteering for multiple organizations to get back to the community.
good,"My personal experience at CarMax has been great. I've been at CarMax for just over 2 years. After loosing my job as a truck driver due to a defibrillator implant after a heart attack. CarMax was the first company to give me a chance. I started in mechanical but was having some trouble keeping up physically due to medical condition. They worked with me and I now work in supply. They have been really great to work for they seem to have a great company culture. They take very good care of their associates, I couldn't be happier. It's like anything else it's what you make of it."
good,If your not bought in your not going to last. I loved Lancaster. The stores are all very different. Pay is very low. they have great hours and the management team will have your back but you must do your part. You can learn alot from this team no one is perfect.
good,"Unlike traditional car dealerships, I genuinely feel like I am helping people find the right car through the best experience possible. A lot of money to be made. People who love customer service will thrive."
good,"Great place to work but not a lot of income. The culture was very positive,"
good,Carmax is a great company. The work is easy and the employees are fun. Management is good as long as you are doing what you are supposed to do. The only down side is the schedule. You can end up working all the time if you dont manage your customers properly.
good,Fun Place to work. Great work life balance. I would have loved to continue my career there however the culture and constant shift of the company made it difficult to pursue growth opportunities
good,"An awesome company with great benefits. CarMax is always changing, good place to get great sales experience. The money is not the greatest, but it is not bad. Great great company, I’ve been blessed with being at different locations and great managers."
good,There is so much to learn and appreciate about working there. They teach you tools and prepare you for everything that could happen. They believe in you.
good,Everyone is pleasant and the management really cares for your development.   I've had a great time working at Carmax and would recommend it to others.
good,"Perfect job for someone looking to make a lot of money for a minimal amount of work. Great benefits, opportunities for advancement, positive atmosphere"
good,"I liked the job and the family, but my boss always made me feel left out and felt to pushy to make people, almost force them, to buy cars that they couldn’t afford."
good,"Exceptional training and development coupled with an unbeatable culture! Daily challenged to help make CarMax a better place to work and buy vehicles,"
good,Carmax has a great fast past culture. Truly care about employees and work balance. They pay you for the work you do and there are plenty of opportunities to advance your career or relocate.
good,"Great corporate culture, really friendly associates, amazing benefits even for part-time associates. 401k, stock purchase plan, wholesale car purchasing, HSA. A really diverse group of individuals that work here. The managers are fun and helpful. There is plenty to choose from in terms of what type of job you want, ie. sales, business office, inventory, service. Great place to work."
good,This job is good job you are mostly work with your co workers and great managers. A nice  laid back job a self paced job and nice competitive pay and hour lunches
good,"Company has great training and great benefits. "
good,"Environment was friendly and company easy to work for. This place gave me the opportunity I needed to begin a new career.  Paid training and great benefits, at the time, these benefits were better than my wife's who is a nurse."
good,i worked in inventory. i liked the job alot the cost of living in nashville is just too high for the pay rate for inventory. the people were down to earth and the customers were cool that i interacted with. i drove cars i have never sat in my whole life. it's a decent job if your living situation is stable. like anything else in life you get out of it what you put into it.
good,"If you can naturally sell/ communicate this will be a fun job for you, carmax is constantly advertising so the business comes to you. No standing on the lot chasing people down"
good,This company did so much for me and developed me into the leader I am today. I couldn’t trade the experience and training i received there for anything. If someone didn’t like working for CarMax I would assume they aren’t going to make it very far anywhere else because this company truly takes care of every individual.
good,"CarMax, as a whole, cares for each employee. They have advancement opportunities, training for growth within the company, and they do a good job hiring from within."
good,Great environment to work in. Very day was learning experience great team work. Everyone helped each other. As well great workplace culture. Great management.
good,The managers are understanding. They will work with you on what ever it is you may need help on. The employees are all friendly. They also have events where they will volunteer for organizations.
good,"Great full-time job. I loved working and the people are like family, with that being said don't mix business with pleasure. Have events every month with free food for associates."
good,CarMax has a great culture that involves lots of teamwork and respect between associates and managers. There is definite opportunities for growth and good hours. Its not your typical car lot and can be quiet enjoyable.
good,Commission based job. Fast pace. Recondition all cars going to the front lot. Help out with inventory needs fix all possible defects if possible......
good,"Great environment to be at. Got along with everyone. Best place I’ve ever worked at. And everyone is willing to help everyone out.  Great benefits, and the best thing of all they care about you and they always ask your opinion On how they can better the company."
good,The workplace at Carmax is very team-oriented. Everyone has a role that is important to the company which makes any job that you have feel like it's meaningful. The workers are all friendly and are always glad to help or to just talk.
good,Love working with the customers.  No pressure atmosphere.  Productive sales position.  Challenging when trying to discover the customers needs.  Wonderful to experience various types of vehicles.
good,"It's a great place to get a ""start"" in the Auto Industry. They hire a variety of people with different backgrounds and experience. They offer incentive for their Voice of the Customer Survey. If customers give you a great review, you get rewarded for it."
good,This place is a good place to work for business office manager and sale management team are amazing. They just need the right LGM for the place.good people overall.
good,Great place to work.  Really didn't stay long enough to get though to see how far I could of gotten.  Worked on the buying side so interaction with other departments were very minimal.
good,Productive and fun place to work.I started with a new store that was not opened.Carmax sent me to Virginia for training and gave me all the tools I needed to become successful.The store and I became successful immediately.
good,I currently work here as a fleet driver and it is awesome. Pay is pretty good but the health insurance could be better but overall great place to work.
good,"I loved the people the office it was very easy to maintain what was needed. The people I had to call were even nice to me , I guess because I was nice to them."
good,"I was often busy and had a lot of fun. I learned a lot about financing, accounting practices and vehicle titles. I only wish they paid better and a set schedule."
good,"I have worked with Carmax from 2007-2012 and moving up in position was fairly simple. It is, however, a fast paced work place with a lot of responsibility. Each department must work together."
good,One of the greatest work families I ever had the pleasure of working with. Friendliest management out there! Always willing to work with you schedule. I never dreaded a day of coming into work. My second home from home!
good,Drives you with team work and individual development. Great team of managers committed to employer success. Company goals for exceptional customer experience
good,Fun place to work just don't try to switch departments. It is a great place to learn especially if you are interested in ope ing your own shop. Every make and model will come through the doors.
good,I worked for Carmax for 8 years. It was a great company to work for. I was able to experience several jobs under one roof. Only reason I left after 8 years was to be a stay at home mom.
good,Carmax is a great company to work for. They are very invested in development and growth of their employees on all levels. Management is great as well. Unfortunately I resigned due to a better opportunity and better pay rate.
good,I loved working here. You get paid for what you put in and its worth it if you plan on making it a career. Management tightens up during the winter only because its slow. When business is booming the numbers speak for themselves.
good,"Carmax is an amazing company to work for.. A lot of room for growth in a professional corporate setting that really sets you up for success . You watch yourself grown and learn at CarMax."
good,Nice office with a great café and good place to work. Had a gym and they seem to take care of their people well. It was a short contract but I would go back
good,"Hacer evaluaciones contables y administrativas de la empresa, la elaboración de informaciones contables y administrativas de interés para la empresa Internacional Chrysler L.C.C, control , verificacion y registros de las operaciones diarias del concesionario."
good,"This company really cares about you and your development. They value your opinion and take your suggestioons seriously, which is rare in the retail world."
good,"loved working for Carmax as the workload and pay scale was well"
good,"Carmax is a great company and has a very well defined company culture. Expect to get plenty of feedback and coaching. If you work hard and do as expected the possibilities for promotion are endless. The new cross functional format still has a few kinks to work out, but overall is a great management trainee program. You will learn a lot of new skills and will move up very quickly, especially if you are willing to relocate. Compensation is a little on the lower side compared to the industry average initially, but the opportunity for advancement and excellent work/life balance more than enough make up for the compromise. Overall, if you are looking for a job that continually refines your skills, has adequate work/life balance, has a family atmosphere and puts your career growth first, carmax is the place for you. I certainly loved my time here and will always recommend it to other people. My reason for leaving is personal, but I certainly will always consider rejoining."
good,"Management Assistant Job tasks filled most of my day but the Business office side was enjoyable. The culture is infectious, you feel like your opinion matters. The company puts importance on being balanced and provides many opportunities to create family events whenever possible."
good,A typical day consisted of taking inbound and making outbound collection and customer service calls. I would negotiate payments. There were miscellaneous tasks as well such as creating training material and organizing meeting outlines.
good,"First off there is a lot to learn. Specifically, as a cross-functional store (smaller store compared to the larger stores) they teach us how to do everything. From how to recommend cars based off customer's lifestyles, go on test drives, run finance applications, review finance offers, sign paperwork, to even washing the cars and loading them on and off the transporter trucks, there is a LOT of responsibility. The great thing about CarMax is that your managers and peers will teach you how to be successful, and they are realistic about the timing it takes to fully learn everything. "
good,"CarMax is a great place and is perfect to get to know people, make contacts, and just get good wholesome customer experience. they have a great community between the 5 departments that you work with and grow with"
good,"I worked as an auto technical during the tradition model set up.  In that environment, you were motivated to hustle and do more work.  It was a fast paced, high intensity shop, but it also allowed for fun at work.  I heard the new model is designed for cost effectiveness and better quality, so I would be curious to see the new atmosphere."
good,It is a face paced environment. You will work a lot of hours but it is well worth the hours you put in. If you work the hours you will make decent money there. The company takes good care of you. This company is not like another typical car dealership.
good,"As a full time employee you can work as much as you want to (minimum 40 hours weekly)."
good,"You're working in a group setting and after a while you begin to see each other as family. "
good,My experience with CarMax has been good.  They treat employees with respect and work with your schedule for part-timers. The ability to move around and transfer to various store locations is good if you like to travel and help out other departments.
good,"A good place to grow and thrive in a work setting, The management was always over your shoulder. But they had died lines and quotes to make so its understandable."
good,Carmax is great team enviroment where hard work and dedication is truly recognized! Compansation and benifits are spectacular. I would definitly work there again.
good,"Ever since I began working with CarMax, I haven't had a day go by where I haven't learned something new. Management is extremely patient and helps guide sales consultants to make more sales. It's a fast paced environment and my benefits and compensation are awesome."
good,"This has been the fastest paced job I've ever worked. When production numbers have to be met, there is no room for error. Management was solid, and working one on one with the team, often out there with us working hand in hand, no complaints. Great emphasis in teamwork."
good,The team working and getting the best satisfaction from any customer that will walk into the dealership for any reason.
good,"Atmosfera de  munca buna cu o organizare buna si colegi care stiu sa colaboreze pentru o munca in echipa cat mai roditoare ,partea cea mai agreabila a fost tipul si organizarea buna."
good,Assist customers to get ideal car. Learned key aspects of selling practices. management is a bit strict on your performance as far as sales. Coworkers were fun to work with and made good friends. Hardest part is to try to get customers to buy and convince them that used cars are better bargain than new (since my location only sold used cars). Most enjoyable part was when you got a customer to sign on a car.
good,"Fast pace workplace, teamwork oriented, friendly and understanding company. Customer driven people look for solutions in any situation. Fun people to work around."
good,"Typical days are quite long. Usually 10 hours or more. On average, a person will walk 5 miles per day (it's a large lot). Not to mention it's almost entirely outside, so one will get lots of sun. While there, I've learned a great deal about the automotive industry. Enough so, that I could easily run my own small dealership. The management is usually promoted based on their numbers, not on people skills. So they can be quite abrasive when coaching team members. The hardest part of the job is working in the rain. Seriously. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom. Once you are set with  task, you are free to do so as you please. Just so long as you do it properly and to Carmax's quality and safety standards. There's also a pin pong table in the break room."
good,Always had a enjoyment and rewarding day. Love helping others and going over and beyond for the company as well as customers.
good,"Helped with FQC (Final Quality Check), prep vehicles for delivery to new owners, maintained the car inventory in the back and front lots, helped with transporters who dropped off and/or picked up vehicles. Management was very friendly, supportive, and very understandable. Carmax had a lenient scheduling system that supported my school life. Whenever I needed more or less hours they'd be willing to work with me. Everyone at the store was very friendly and knowledgeable."
good,"Worked part time here while furthering my education. Offered great flexibility and earnings for time spent at work. management was engaged, and tuition reimbursement was excellent"
good,CarMax is a great company to work for and it's a company that honestly values it's employees and customers. It's a very fast paced environment and can be a bit stressful at times. Management is completely focused on your development which allows for excellent training and growth opportunities. I truly enjoyed working with my coworkers and all the different customers I had the pleasure of meeting each and every day.
good,"Carmax  has been a great career for me thus far.  Allowing me the opportunity to train new hires in sales as well as accomplishing new levels in sales.  The company is great to work for, allowing employees the opportunity to grow if desired."
good,Management is completely focused on your development rather than micro managing everything you do. Lots of growth opportunity. Strong bond between fellow associates. The best part about this job is how laid back it is.
good,CarMax is a great company to work for due to the great team and the awesome company goals of integrity and putting the customer first.
good,"This was my first job I had full-time and I loved it. I felt like I was properly trained, and it is a good company. They really care about their employees, and it is a family atmosphere."
good,Carmax is a great place to work. They have a great culture. There is plenty of room for advancement. Managers spend a lot of time on employee development.
good,A great company to work for. Very supportive management with consistent productive developmental feedback to improve your sales. I truly believe its on of the best auto dealerships out there.
good,"A typical day would start with a complete audit of cars assigned to you,  This is done by computerized tracking system.  Picking up cars from other locations, and daily audit of incoming products receipts for accuracy."
good,"Work at your own pace work environment.  Thorough and ongoing training process prepares you for the sales environment.  Excellent working relation with co-workers.  Most difficult part of the job was the inconsistency of pay.  Sometimes it was amazing, others it would be lean."
good,"Overall Great Company. Great Benefits. Loved the Graveyard Shift."
good,"Excelente todos los tra.Bajadores amenos, responsables, aprendi el funcionamiento de la lavandería"
good,"CarMax is a productive company, which I truly enjoy.  Lots of teamwork in the Finance Department. It has really broaden my skills in the Customer Service Field. Working with CarMax I have been able to grasps the full understanding of leadership and complete understanding of ""TEAM"" and respect for others."
good,"Commission only! Best training that I've received anywhere. The training is transferable to any industry and the feedback/development tactics are great also. They focus on building their consultants. Like all industries, it's operated by humans so it  isn't perfect, but I really admired the CarMax ideology. They give you a platform to ""be your own boss"" to some degree."
good,Carmax cares about their employees. They provide a lot of incentives and you can matriculate through the company in a timely fashion.
good,Carmax is truly a great place to get an honest and quick service on a car that you are selling or buying. We know what we are doing an we are here to help.
good,CarMax is a great place to work. There are really good benefits and good compensation for work that is done. The only downside and the reason I'm looking for another position is because I'm trying to find work were I'm off on the weekends. I hope I can find something with CarMax and continue to work here.
good,"Great place, nice enviroment and great management team however the compensation is  not that great and the customers are just the worst in the industry."
good,I enjoyed my time with CarMax and the opportunity to learn and grow.  It was nice meeting all of the customers when we processed their sales/purchases.  Their are many processes to learn in the Business Office but they have a fabulous training process and a continuing education program.  The changing retail schedule was at times challenging.
good,"Overall an awesome place to work for. Great sales training, with good management. Provided world class customer service to each and every customer."
good,CarMax is great place to meet and build relationships with people. They offer great benefits for part-time and full-time employees. It's a great place for any motivated individual to start from the bottom and move their way up the ladder.
good,"CarMax"
good,"Carmax is an amazing place to work. No wonder why it has been a 'Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For,"" for 10 years in a row...."
good,"My typical day at work was going to my desk and being on the phone all day. It was a very boring job but the company is great. You don't have to worry about any micromanagers or manager not doing their job properly.....I think it's because everybody had to start from the bottom and that was either in customer service or In early collections. There is room for advancement but the only bad thing is that if you start in early collections the main road is to take late collections and so forth. Which for me personally, I couldn't stand being on the phone anymoreeee. So switching to a different besides the ones everybody switched to was very difficult. Also, it is very difficult to go from part time to full time if you started part time. Mainly because they have to wait until availability opens up and that can be anywhere from 6 months to a year. And the schedules they come out with are set schedules so you have to pray it works for you. But over all, people are nice and fun. Managers are understanding and knowledgeable and you learn a lot."
good,"The company values hard work and Integrity above all else.  Fun environment, and a management team that actually cares about your personal growth and success.  I came from a completely different industry with skepticism, and have become a raving fan.  I will continue to patron this company long after I leave, and encourage my friends and family to.  Great people, great training, and a world-class product/service"
good,I enjoyed working for CarMax as a sales associate. I learned great customer service tools. Management was amazing they were great teachers. Coworkers worked as a team which can be shocking for a car sales environment. The hardest part was the late night hours.
good,"I started my time with Carmax as a Parts Associate, which was a good job but unfortunately was not a position desirable for those who like to be challenged with new tasks. I transferred from California to Colorado as a Reconditioning Associate. As an RA, I got promoted for my ability to assess and repair cosmetic imperfections of cars quickly and to a professional quality. I trained many new hires in this field. I also worked on cars as a stand in lube tech when needed. Overall a great company to work for to gain experience in the automotive industry. Excellent opportunities for travel and career development. Great coworkers and personable management."
good,"As sales manager, I managed a team of 11 sales people. I had great co-workers and enjoyed training the sales team to make the customer experience a great one."
good,"A typical day at work is 9 Hours long you get a 1 hour lunch and a 15 minute paid break. Management is also very good. They are always wanting to train you in new things to get you in the position you want.  My co-workers are fun to they are all around the same age and all are willing to work hard. There is no true hard part to this job other than you are in all weather conditions rain or shine,snow or sleet work goes on no matter what but you get used to it. Most enjoyable part about the job is probably you get to job every car you could imagine and company cooks outs or company lunches every 6 months or more. The pay is not the best but it is a couple dollars more than minimum wage and you get 40 hours a week as full time unless its the slow down month and then its 32 hours a week but that should only last a 2 weeks or so."
good,"You might have long work weeks, but you do work with friends. They are always developing its associates, and trying to build a better CarMax."
good,"Carmax is a good company to work with, the only thing is that managers need more recognizing employer for thier good job. Other then that everything is good benefits is great but medical is to expensive could be a little more lower?. co-worker are great very friendly easy to get along. Overall is a great job."
good,Work was a very independent work place once you finish all of the training. They insure that you know every bit of knowledge you need to know for any position you work there. Everyone that works there is very friendly and willing to help anyone in need. The hardest part of the job was just making sure you kept in contact with your customers even after they had made their purchase. Although the best part of the job is how many people you meet.
good,"A typical day at work is taking appointments (if you can make them) or hoping someone come in and get an appraisal or buy a car. The training is awesome and you learn a lot during the time you are in training. Management is really productive and always willing to help you and help you learn, and make more money. The hardest part of the job will be staying on top of your customers without being to pushy just to try to make a sale, esp. when its a slow month. The most enjoyable part would be the great people. flexible hours, and always being able to win stuff. (morning training sometimes the managers have a little competition and you win free gift cards for lunch, etc)"
good,"I had a great time at Carmax, even in my short time being there. Everyone, including the managers, was kind and courteous, and was truly looking out for everyone else."
good,Displayed exceptional knowledge of handling customer queries and providing quality customer service
good,CarMax is a wonderful place to work for. The management takes the time to listen to employee opinions and will adjust things to increase productivity and employee satisfaction.
good,Big Fortune 500 company so lots of online training videos. I enjoyed working there I left bc I sucked at selling cars. Managers were awesome. I worked in Austin and OKC both places had the same environment.
good,Days start with associates meeting to talk about how production is and what if anything needs improvement. Learn new things with coworkers and management. Company is open to all races and religions.
good,"All my coworkers were amazing, nothing like working in a typical car shop. The work load is also extremely manageable if not fast paced. The potential for associate growth was also great."
good,"I had a great interview and the staff is always helpful and friendly,  they do take care of there in employees,  over all it is a great place to work and help you grow as a person."
good,I have a small team of coworkers that i work with everyday they are great people and we all work great together. Everyday we have a main task of completing our work with no errors and make sure we are efficient as possible.
good,"Very easy job, On your feet all day, work around your co-workers help one another, always give it your 110%, there’s always an opportunity to develop within the company"
good,"Great training, good mentors, and grow more from within. Teach basic business to your people and grow them in to leaders. Thank you for a great career."
good,CarMax is a great place to work! There are plenty of opportunities for growth. The management team is helpful and will coach you to improve. The sales goals are realistic and easy to achieve if you put your mind to it.
good,"Good experience, great people very challenging,  never not busy. It was a great company to work for. I decided to take some personal time off and then decided not to go back.  Great company to work for though nothing bad to say."
good,"I would work for this company again in a heart beat. They made me feel like a human and not a number, even the higher ups. They tried making the workplace fun and included everyone. They took special consideration into your work and praised publicly."
good,"Great benefits, does not pay the best but had a really good package over all. there are opportunities to relocate anywhere the united states. and great employee discounts"
good,"A good work environment. Good work schedule, employee and customer oriented. Management helpful and ongoing training. Good customer feedback meant receiving free merchandise, uniforms, and trip to Las Vegas for the annual. Good 401k."
good,Working at CarMax was a mix of technical challenges and exciting work. They stay on the cutting edge and are always pushing to the next level. I enjoyed working there and would have stayed if I wasn't moving away.
good,"Great company. To this day, it is still my favorite job that I've worked. I would have stayed on if the certifications process was smoother. I was also stuck doing Off-Lot Coordinator to cover the previous girl who was on maternity leave. Once she returned I wasn't returned to my previous position to continue the certifications process. That's where I stayed until I graduated technical school and went into the HVAC industry."
good,There is always training to help you succeed and plenty of money to be made of you work hard at selling. They are sales driven so you must keep up with your customers. I sold a lot of cars. The only hard part is it is commission only.
good,Can’t think off any negative thoughts except my hours are night shift I work as a Fleet driver and it’s a great job good work ethics from managers and  very  respectful towards everyone they have probably the best benefits that I have ever had 401 matched at 7% off your pay vacation sick days personal days lunch on them from time to time once a month just really happy other than my hours.
good,"Working at CarMax allowed me to meet many new interesting people, As an avid car enthusiast, I got the opportunity to learn a lot about the vehicles that were being sold by the company. I learned many innovative ways to engage customers, discern their needs and use that knowledge to help select a vehicle that satisfies the customer's needs and budget."
good,Carmax will invite and take you in as family and feed you alot alot :-) great company to work for with a great staff and a great overall work experience

good,"Whether you like selling cars or not, this company is what every employer should strive to be like. I only left to start a family, but my standards have forever been raised by CarMax and I will never accept anything less than everything they offered. Coworkers were amazing, management was perfection, pay was great (I was 21 making over $70k a year), everything was great. Only the customers ever gave me anything to complain about. Do be prepared for the stress of being in a 100% commission position though. I could make $3k in three days and then $0 the next week. So don't be a dumb 21yo and BUDGET. Sales people are split into teams and each team has their own manager so you always have someone to call/text and always have someone willing to help you. If you weren't making sales, you didn't get reprimanded, they sat you down and asked how they could help, would role play with you, and come up with strategies to help. There's not a ""sales shark"" environment, if you're available to take a customer, you scan your badge at the front and as customers come in, they go to the first person on the list, no favoritism. System is designed for there to be no way to screw a customer over, I will NEVER buy a car from anyone but them for the rest of my life. Location general manager would grill for us on July 4th, memorial day, labor day, etc. Busy Saturdays meant pizza or barbecue or sandwiches provided to the employees. We would have a potluck on Thanksgiving with catered turkey. Huge party for Christmas with giveaways for 4k flat screens, kitchenaid mixers, full size smokers, the works. I"

good,"CarMax is a wonderful company to work for. They offer very detailed training for salary and hourly positions. The management and other associates are extremely helpful and friendly, and willing to help other associates extend their knowledge of the business. I have learned many great values that have helped my development greatly. There is no ""typical"" work day, as everyday presents new and exciting challenges, and some days (especially weekends) are much more busier than others. The most enjoyable part of this job is providing excellent service to the customers when they come in to purchase, or sell a vehicle. I also learn something new here, and it keeps it interesting."
