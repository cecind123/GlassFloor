good,"I enjoyed working at Chipotle  for a while. The environment is fast-paced and exciting. My coworkers were great. The hardest part for me to deal with after a while were the customers. People are very picky with food. They complain about portion sizes and blame it on the workers being ""stingy"" but in reality the company regulates how much we are supposed to serve to the customers. A lot of customers were very rude and didn't treat me as a human. That was the worst part of the job. Of course, any customer service job is going to have its customer issues. Eventually I just didn't want to put up with it."

good,"Chipotle has a terrible reputation because of an incident it had in its history. They took that and learned from it. They had high standards and actually cared about the job. I enjoyed working there everyday, and could easily see a future there. They had a staircase of promotion for their workers, and a literal step by step training to advance. You took it at your own pace and could move up as long as fast as you wanted to. All they asked in return is a positive attitude and constant work. The culture at Chipotle had people correcting each other mistakes and improving the team at every step of the way. The only downfall I could find in the job was the repetition of words we had to use almost to the point of being robotic. The best part of the job was a lack of a ceiling for your job advancement. All and All amazing place to work."
good,Every morning without fail someones personal music is played and everyone dances and sings loudly as we prep before opening the restaurant for that day
good,"When working at Chipotle, I was responsible for counting and calculating money at the beginning and end of each shift. I made sure the drink station was always stocked and all the drinks in the machine were functioning. I was in charge of making sure the dining area was clean. I was to inform my co-workers when certain foods were running low and needed to be prepared. I was also responsible to take online orders and repeating the order to the workers that worked on the line."

good,"Chipotle Mexican Grill was the first real job I had. I fell in love with working there and my coworkers were the best. Of course at every location the workers will be different but at the two locations I was able to work for, I loved it. There's always something to do and always surprise rushes.

good,If you like working in  restaurant then this is a really fun job. I personally liked my job doing prep. I didn't have to deal with the public much in the area.
good,Although this is a great job to have you do not get paid enough for the work you do and although it is easy its very very very fast paced and you barely get breaks. The staff and managers are very friendly so it makes it worth while.

good,I liked the company a lot but it was extremely stressful at times. Working on the line and dealing with customers was the hardest part mainly because our supervisors wanted us to be fast when we were already doing our best.
good,"Chipotle was by far my favorite job. The energy of the entire building changes once someone comes in for food, it’s like we lived to serve delicious healthy food ! Our attention was always on our customers satisfaction! And when things got super busy, (such as lunch time or brunch on Saturdays) the entire line would have such a good flow that the customers never stopped moving and never had to wait in a long line because they were constantly moving ! It was a wonderful  experience to be able to be a part of the Chipotle crew !"
good,"Toms River's Chipotle has been by far one of my favorite places to work. They encourage a positive, fast paced environment that allows for growth and advancement. No question is stupid and no mistake is ridiculed. The customers specific to this region are some of the nicest I've come in contact with out of any service job I've worked."
good,In a typical day of working at chipotle we prepare the food and make it look presentable. We clean and efficiently serve food for customers. I learned that in a job you have to be collaborative with you coworkers to work best.
good,I don't really remember much about the job. What I do remember is that it was a nice first job. Nice staff where always there to help when needed. Nice managers.

good,"Working at Chipotle was an incredible experience for me because of the people I worked with and the environment we created. I learned alot and developed a great sense of respect for kitchen work and the industry as a whole. However, Chipotle corporate is incredibly convoluted and in my experience, the area managers fall short of the company mission to create nourished communities."
good,"Chipotle was a really great first job during my sophomore and junior year in high school. I appreciated my supervisors support and I enjoyed working on such a great team!"
good,Working st chipotle has been a great experience I’ve learned a lot of new things and new skills that I will use to this day outside of the work field.
good,Everyone was amazing. One of the best jobs I have worked at. Great management team. And awesome co workers. Just bad timing for me. One day maybe if the time presents itself I would be able to go back.
good,The workers are very welcoming. They will support you through your shifts and will not let you fall behind. It gets very busy at times especially on Halloween but in the end the workers all become very close with each other and will always stay in touch with you even after you may leave. This is a family.
good,"I always looked forward to going to work because of the welcoming and fun environment. I had a very good relationship with all of my coworkers, we would always be helping each other out.

good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle treated me well and was extremely prideful in the way they did their jobs. It was quick paced, and helped me perfect multi-tasking. Yay Chipotle"
good,Working for three years it has helped me with attitude adjustments and taught me to live comfortably on my own. it has showed me that a work environment can be relaxed and fast pace at the same time.
good,I had worked for the company for almost 3 years and i had loved it. I wouldnt change anything about it.we had paid vacations and paid breaks. Not many restraunts offer that.
good,"Great place to work at very busy especially if you love fast paced environments. Management is amazing as well as the coworkers "

good,"Chipotle was the best first job I ever had, it was always customers walking in and out and there was nothing better than seeing how happy customers were while they were watching us put those bowls and burritos together for them."
good,Although it’s fast paced everyone was super nice and helpful and as a result the customers were nice also . Manager was very understanding and everyone respected each other

good,I loved working there. I will work there again if I had the opportunity. The greatest food. Loved the people who came to order. I would just love to start working there immediately
good,Chipotle has its pros and cons but I would say the pros over weighed the cons. Chipotle is a great opportunity to do lots of growing if you plan to give lots of time I’m dedication to your job and jus the vibe of everything is positive and energetic if I were to recommend any job this would be one only con would be that everyone gets paid the same so being that I was grill felt some positions did more work than others meaning those with that position should earn more
good,Working at chipotle I learned how to communicate with people better.  A typical work day at Chipotle starts off slow then get busy but we still try to work together without attitude. The hardest part of the job is when customers come in and try to be rude when we are giving our best and trying to be as nice as possible
good,Great place to work and you have the ability to control your daily work flow. It was a pleasure to share my skill and experience with the new and upcoming management team.

good,The managers are always making you a better employee and you are always one of there top priorities after our customers. Your managers always come from our own company and own crew
good,The place would get really packed during 4-6pm which made time go by very fast. The people working there were really chill and I enjoyd going to work.
good,"While working at Chipotle, I would typically start at 4:30 and work until 11:30. As I walked in, I would wash my hands and change my drawer before the shift. During my shift I would clean lobby, clean the ""deck,"" or the place they prepared the guests food at, and check our guests out making sure they were pleased with their visit. After the store closed at 10 pm, I would check myself out of my drawer and start cleaning. I was expected to be done cleaning lobby at 10:15 pm, correct and efficiently. After that, I had to help the person cleaning grill and close down the rest of the store with the other employees by our deadline of 11 pm."

good,"Chipotle has showed me how to care so much about food safety and safety about others in general .  Taking care of quality food and prepping each with awareness and cleanliness goes a long way. its about caring about the product and getting the job done. I enjoyed actually satisfying the customers when they asked who prepared this food , because it would look representable and good to the customers eyes."

good,Like I said it's really fun to work there and the mangers are great too and fun to be with the rest of the team members . And  if you make a mistake like everyone does they won't get mad . And you have patients wit you and you learn really fast and you get free food and discounts . The bad thing was there no days off you work every day 7 days a week and they would also call you to come in the evening if you worked in the mornings
good,fast pace environment . allot of team work and has great opportunities for better paying positions. prepares you for other job opportunities that can be competitive.

good,"typical day at work meant prepping and serving food to customers and cleaning the entire store. upper management really shows they care about every store. they show up when some thing goes wrong, when something goes right, and various times just to check in. in my opinion the only real way to run these types of fast casual dining experience restaurants is to have a district management team that is willing to get feedback firsthand in a face to face/face to store encounter."

good,Chipotle is a good job to get your feet wet. but as along term thing Chipotle is nothing more than a dream job as comparison as to what is held in the near future.
good,"A typical work day would be prep at all stations. Chipotle doesn't have freezers, so everything was made fresh. When we opened, customers poured in. we were making and prepping as we went. It was constant. I learned a lot about team pushing to be the best. We were always hard on each other for perfection. Management were very much hands on. We were all responsible for being a top notch team member. We were determined to be the best at all times. Everything was time oriented and fast paced. The job was not hard, but was stressful when everyone is working towards perfection.

good,"Everyone helps out each other. "
good,"I start the day at 8:30 and start shredding cheese, then I put them in pans, label them with the date and put it in the walk-in fridge. Then I begin making salsas. After that, I set up the line and take my break. After everything I do, I must clean up after myself. This makes you want to work as clean as possible so that you have to clean up less. After my break, we open the store. I stay on the line and greet customers and ask what their order is. I wrap burritos, close up bowls, thank customers and move on to the next person in line."
good,"was a line worker at Chipotle. There were several duties; you could be in the meat portion, you actually distribute the meat and beans, or you could be in the tortilla machine, where you press the tortillas and get them ready, or you could be the sauce person, or the burrito roller. I was actually good at all the duties you had there, I was all across the line, but I was also in the back prepping the food as well. With that, you’re expected to wash the food for cooking, as well. It could get crazy when we got a little busy."

good,"Here at chipotle you learn how to be a leader. I learned so much working here, Starting from the smallest things to mopping to learning the recipes.

My favorites are morning shifts, because I get there early, have two and a half hours of working without customers pouring in the door, and know that I’ll be done at 4:00 and can spend the evening with my family. My main station at Chipotle is “tort”, which is the first half of the Chipotle-ordering process (rice, beans, fajitas, and meat), and also includes frying and bagging chips and frying crispy taco shells."

Now need I not to mention, in the fax area there is only one person taking care of everything. So sometimes you feel the heat and the pressure more then the employees in the front line where everyone is designed to their station. The management at my job was pretty good, they took care of everything fare. They did their job which made it easier on us as employees. I had some cool co-workers very fun and humorous.

I have learned a lot, and that's coming from someone who came in the company with very little knowledge of cooking, and only a few months later becoming a Kitchen Manager. I learned how to prepare foods such as chicken, steak, pork, beef, salsa, guacamole, and box cheese. I also learn how to slice and dice pepper, onions, chicken, steak, and shred beef, pork, and cheese in the proper fashion. The management was good, and I really loved being around the co-workers, we all collectively created a great atmosphere. The hardest part of the job for me in the begging would be grill. like I said before, before this job I have very little experience in cooking, so it was quite a challenge for me.
