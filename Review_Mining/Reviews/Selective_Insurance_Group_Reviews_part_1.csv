rating,review
bad,Personal Lines Management was so awful that it was stifling.  People couldn't even concentrate on working for fear of getting fired.  I would never ever recommend that place to my worst enemy.
bad,"I only worked part time, but I didn't feel as though they treated me as an equal from an employee standpoint. They required me to do work in 3 days that most needed 5 days to do which caused a tremendous amount of stress."
bad,"Unreasonable management, cutthroat environment, tell you one thing but expect something else, no work life balance.  Pay is good but the hours are completely ridiculous.  Duplication of effort, expectations change weekly."
bad,Hostile PMO Organization with a Senior Leader that has no experience in running a Project Management Office.  This company is not well respected in the outside walls of its compound either.  I never heard one good thing about this company from current and former employees.
bad,Only lasted a week.  Work environment was terrible.  I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to work there.
bad,terrible place to work. no compasion for their employees even when they are execellent in their position and get good reviews
bad,"No true appreciation of employees with strong skill sets and dedication,  you will be taken for granted, given more work and allowed to burn out. "
bad,Worked for a manager who was clueless with regard to managing the department. Pit one employee against another. Discussed others performance with peers. Had peers report back on each other and then questions why the department disliked each other. Horrible management style.
bad,Bunch of old people who don’t understand IT and hate change. The office is located in the middle of no where. These dinosaurs are going down. Stay away.
bad,You are paid for 40 hours/salary but the work load takes over 50 hours a week to complete. The management is poor and has no suggestions or provides any assistance for the abundance of work.
bad,"Worked in branchville for about 1 year. They expect the world but will pay you below min for your skill set. They expect perfection and love to tell you how much they pay you and expect more. The interview process takes over a month. They provide no ramp up time or training in any way. If you ask questions you are told to sit down and ""struggle""... you are micro managed to no end. You are not allowed to make mistakes and if you do you are given no remorse. There are many other normal company's out there to work for. Dont be led like a sheep to the slauter..."
bad,"Although they allow you to work form home 2 days/week this place will use and abuse you with insanely high workloads, a disconnected management, unobtainable goals, which overall create low moral within the company. There is an unusual high amount of turnover and management doesn't blink and eye."
bad,"Over worked.  When people leave they're not replaced and work is pushed on to others.  Management has no idea how stressed the employees are, no positive morale."
bad,"They train you how to use their lousy computer systems, and then, you are 'on your own'. The expectations are ridiculous, so, no matter what, you are set up for failure. Turnover is high. You meet someone new, and within 90 days they have quit, were put on a performance plan, or they were fired. No one can handle the workload, and management badmouths employees within earshot of other employees. Pay is good, but, it doesn't balance with the hours expected. Employee morale is horrible and it is an incredibly hostile work environment. Management are poorly trained and ineffective. They are overloaded with work, and have so many meetings they are never available for their team."
bad,Place was stressful and horrible to work. Pay was low and the management team was disconnected. You have no ramp up time and they treat you like high school kids. Stay away at all costs.
bad,"It doesn't appear management really care about their employees here, its more about the customers and agent happiness. The training program is not built to help you succeed and a lot of management, that Have no idea what they are doing. The company is not a team environment, everyone is for themselves, instead of working and helping another. The stress you will receive is truly not worth it."
bad,"If you are reading this, you should consider looking elsewhere. I am a current employee and although I really used to enjoy my time here I assure you this has become a ""sweat shop"" and no one is happy anymore. It is really sad to see this place go downhill and take a toll on these people. This is a good group of people who are simply overworked."
bad,No Formal training is provided. Antique Software System. No Moral. Divided Departments. Stressful Environment. Overworked Employees. Pay is ok. I would not recommend this company.
bad,"The company had very unfair pay policies. They would pay new people just off the street more money than the experienced workers who had been there for years. Then the more experienced workers were expected to tran the new employees that were making more than them."
bad,"I worked at Selective for over 2 years. I worked at least 55 hours a week just to manage my desk and even that was not sufficient. Management is horrible and they don't listen to any suggestions from.the people who the work. They have an outdated computer system, the work load is unmanageable and you are not appreciated at all. The turnover in the Charlotte office in the workers compensation department has been devastating. I have to say.in all honesty this is not a company that you want to work for."
bad,They pay well but micromanage you so much. They are so disconnected also. Everyone there is rude and snobby.  I couldnt even use the bathroom without being asked where are you going. The training dept is also horrible.
bad,There is absolutely no work life balance.  work from home options do not even make that better.  The amount of work assigned is more than unmanageable.  Never feel good about your job at the end of the day.  work at home means start early and stay late as you didn't have to drive to work.  Management is so disconnected.
bad,"Selective overall was not a bad company to work for, but the Customer Relations department was absolutely backwards. Training was lacking, and other employees continuously stuck their nose in others' business when it was not needed. Management could not provide a clear objective for the department and has a ""do as I say, not as I do"" mentality. Management also continuously set up the staff of the department up for failure, and rarely gave positive feedback or any feedback at all. Issues with employees' work was not addressed individually, but rather were addressed through vague, passive-aggressive emails sent to the whole department."
bad,Not a great place to work. Hostile work environment and way to top heavy. They try to do activities to promote a team environment but until they address poor management the culture will remain sub par.
bad,"Selective has made a quick decent downhill in recent years as far as its appreciation for employees.  We are all overworked, over stressed, and under appreciated.  Our so called new systems are antiquated, several years old, and some of them aren't even supported by the vendors because they are such old versions of the product.  Last year we had a short window with numerous new systems and redesigns that all simply fell apart.  Insureds and agents are experiencing long hold times when trying to reach us, inaccurate bills,  and numerous other issues.  Employees are expected to work longer hours and take on more duties without any appreciation or compensation. "
bad,"Hostile work environment, unappreciated management staff, high turnover, very outdated systems, very cheap.  Use this company as a stepping stone to get where you really want to go."
bad,"They work you to the bone and management is lack luster. No work life balance. People quit left and right. "
bad,Expected to work 10+ hours each day and weekends. No work life balance.  Management is disconnected from day to day workload and is not interested in employee concerns.
bad,"A company with high potential but lacks the ability to compete with companies closer to NYC. Gets away with low salaries and the end result is high turnover, low morale, lack of incentive, and additional costs associated with hiring new personnel with great frequency."
bad,"Extremely high turnover. People are quitting faster than they can be hired/replaced. Workloads are unreasonable, because of the high turnover. "
bad,I would place books in a corp design (planagram) at various local stores.
bad,"Overall the teams work well together.  Project time are determine before enough analysis can be done, so often you work nights and weekends.  "
bad,"Refusal to adapt to a changing professional environment. Management views their employees as property and often expects them to stay late for no real reason other than ""just in case we need you later."""
bad,"“If you don't have a life and enjoy worrying about your job stability, join the Selective team. Incompetent management” ” "
bad,"Local upper management are out of touch with handling of claim volume while adding additional responsibilities.  High turn over in local office, people left their jobs with out even having a replacement."
good,Work life balance has deteriorated for IT FTE's.  Work week is 37.5 hours. Expect to put in 47.5 or more with no compensation.  Taking PTO is a privilege.
good,"excessive work load per individual which lead to no work/life balance. The overall company as a whole is a good, growing company, however there are specific departments that need help."
good,"Typical day for a field rep consists of about 12 hours of work.  Start you day off with your agent appointments and return to your home office to prepare reports for the following day.  I learned that no matter how much I give, I am always able to give more as long as I am appreciated.  I enjoy sharing ideas with co workers in order to learn how the same job goals can be attained many different ways. The hardest part of my job is knowing when to put the phone/laptop down.  In that aspect, I am my worst enemy.  However the most enjoyable is meeting new people every day.  Being able to help give them ideas on how to make their business more successful."
good,An excellent learning environment where you continue to grow each day and learn something new.  It is a very challenging industry where knowledge is everything coupled with being an effective negotiator.
good,Fast paced and focused on new business growth. Well run company with specific and detailed goals. Field operations is a significant focus. Good Field Management
good,"Selective needs to stop worrying about expanding into new territories and hire more employees to handle the current work load.  The future of the company looks great on paper however, the work load is ridiculous."
good,"Overall Selective Insurance is a good company to work for. Certain Regions/departments are not run professionally and in my opinion, have practiced discrimination while trying to be politically correct to maintain ratio percentages. Many good and hardworking people work for Selective but some Managers/Supervisors were given their position not based on their ability, insurance education and technically skills"
good,"Advancement in company."
good,work at home benefits but lack of management support.  Smaller company striving to be one of the big companies and losing value in their employees.
good,Great company to work for in regards to benefits and overall atmosphere. Co-workers are great and helpful. The issue with Selective is that you have to avg 50+ hours per week to keep up with your work load. Selective is growing exponentially at a very fast pace and the fix to high turnover is to simply hire more employees to handle the large number of claims that are incoming. Their training program needs a lot of work as well but I am sure it will get better within the next year or so.
good,"Growing operation was at 22 states but recently expanded in South West.   Good opportunity for someone who is open to relocation to stake their claim and show what they are made of.  Senior leadership is stale, and pending retirement of CEO has most on their guard as new regime comes in."
good,Great company great work life balance but not for everyone as it is a call center environment and you are expected to stay seated and take all calls.  Good benefits!
good,I think that the company is much too casual.  Dress code is not followed unless you are young and pretty.  Some of the underwriters are not quoting out of the box at all which they should be because this company if E & S.
good,"Monitor agents book of business and suggest methods for improvement in production and losses."
good,"Worked here ages ago.  Office culture was fun, people were great, even tho a lot of work it was a nice atmosphere.  I worked at one of their branch offices.  They closed all the branch offices to consolidate everyone into their Branchville location which was too far for me to travel."
good,"Initially started with the company as a trainee at the firm's home office in Branchville, NJ. Then worked primarily as an Inland marine Underwriter handling mostly Builder's Risk business. Was then promoted to a Package Underwriter where I handled all lines of business."
good,Busy place to work. Very well organized in the underwriting department and wonderful to work with everyone in the underwriting department.
good,"The company was a good company to work for with good benefits. I had a greatdivision manager. No longer in Tampa, sold TPA workers comp to another TPA."
good,"The best part about Selective is the people. Three is a definite sense of teamwork and working towards a common goal. That said, the fact that the main office is in Branchville, NJ is beginning to create problems in terms of talent. With an average age of 48 and tenure of 10 years, this is an 'old' company. Limited opportunities for advancement which are often filled by outside hires."
good,Very difficult to direct management toward newer technologies or methodologies. Although some groups used the latest development platforms the general business attitude was behind the times. We had to record our time in 3 different locations and email our manager's manage as well
good,"At this time Selective is undergoing a major change and it is making working there a bit more challenging than it would in a normal Selective work setting. I do recommend this company if you have the ability to work longer hours and are a ""see's the light at the end of the tunnel"" person"
good,"busy, enjoyed answering phones, data enry. Worked well with everyone. Everyone was very helpful."
good,"I was contracted to work there for 3 months which turned into a 1.5 yrs instead. "
good,Good work Life balance.  Immature culture but resources are very knowledgeable.  This company promotes training and provides any training needed to support and improve on
good,independant work. Great staff. Plenty of room for advancement if you're not a temporary employee. Offer great benefits and decent pay.  Everyone is friendly and always professional working together.
good,"Overall, I enjoy what I do.   In general, my experience here has been positive.  There are limited options at my location for advancement, however.   Most stay in the same position or eventually leave.   The lack of advancement is my main motivation for looking elsewhere."
good,"I worked for Selective in a satelite office for 5 years.  I loved the job but left because of change in management and their decision to move my position to PA.  They only gave me 2 days to make the decision to uproot my entire family from MD to PA with minimal relocation assistance.  They also were not willing to allow me to commute from MD to Allentown 2X a week since I would still have direct reports in MD.  No flexibility."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is my contact with clients, attorneys and court staff.  I have excellent communication skills and am a quick problem solver."
good,Unknown - Don't have anything to say. I will continue to state I don't have any sort of recommendation for this employer at anytime of my stay as an employee.
good,"Like all companies, Selective has its Pro's and Con's. I have been her for 19 years so their are many more pro's.  The best art of the job are the people and the worst is the politics.  That can be said about anyplace.  The Executive Management team are personable, dedicated and act in the best interests of the company."
good,a nice company for learning and you get to grow if you put sincere efforts and work efficiently. managers are really good and helpful. good place to interact and develop bonds.
good,Working for Selective I have learned a lot and developed my underwriting skills significantly since finishing the underwriting trainee program and transitioning into a full territory. Selective has great mentors and knowledgeable resources.
good,"Great company, not very will known outside to the eastern part of the country.  I relocated to another city outside the foot print of the company so I had to find another company to work for."
good,"Selective has a solid foundation as a company if your wanting to get exposure into the insurance field. Management wise it is poor, and a lack of communication is evident within certain departments. Certain times you get the feeling of being micromanaged without being told. Expectation levels are high but it doesn't balance with employee recognition and morale is low."
good,The experience has helped me start my accounting career and has helped me improve in my communication and Excel skills. The work itself was enjoyable however the hours were mostly about 10 hours or more on a daily basis.
good,"The working environment is pleasant. The co-workers helpful and knowledgeable."
good,Learned good stuff from team member. Learned new product and improved application.Learned staying calm in stressed situation.Learned utilizing time most beneficial way.
good,This company was my first job out of college giving me an opportunity to ge on the job training in the insurance industry and business.  Received great knowledge about insurance which helped me personally and I was able to hone in on my customer service skills.  Flexibility as I was on the road and had many opportunities to work with customers face-to-face.
good,I liked working for Selective.  Only drawback was that many of the tools utilized are not current versions and caused issues.
good,I believe that Selective really cares about it's employees.  They support several entities outside the company and the employees benefit from this.  The thoroughly support movement within the company.
good,"Managed over 60 accounts, allocating funds, creating relationships, and solving disputes."
good,"Team works together"
good,"Busy days with back to back meetings"
good,"Must be very patient if looking to advance; must wait for positions to open, which is rare.  They encourage furthering insurance eduation with designations (will pay for books, exams, etc.).  Friendly, hardworking atmosphere."
good,I was hired as a temp. I was taught the basic system functions in 4 days.
good,"This is the most wonderful and brightest team I've ever had the good fortune to work with. There is a culture of genuine concern for members of the team, both from peers and leaders. Everyone wants the team and its individual members to be successful."
good,"This is a company that wants to see you grow. You can pass people in th halls and expect a smile or a hello. The CEO will even run into you occasionally and chat with you. There’s a LOT of work and you’re never caught up. That’s the really tough thing. The work is very tedious and requires at least 50-60 hours a week if you want to be someone caught up. The work/ life balance is a little tough. There definitely needs to be more employees to help lighten the load. The company is growing fast with a push for more and more business so the renewals are piling up and becoming harder to manage. However, there are always coworkers willing to help out if they can. Management is pretty good too."
good,Solid company with good management. Opportunities for advancement are there. Solid staff with team approach.
good,"Good to work. I got new opportunity to work on the new new technology PySpark,Python, Spark,Hive,Sqoop. work environment and culture is so good. We promoted major projects to production."
good,"In the beginning it was a relaxed, fun place to work. Then moved to different job role and got a little stressful. Some supervisors were not good at training."
good,Management is great and approachable.  People are very nice to work with and create a very comfortable place to work.  Pay is good and bonus structure is fantastic.
good,Great place to work.  Love the work/life balance.  They really care about their employees.  I worked there for 4 years and would have stayed for many years if we hadn't relocated.  There are a tremendous amount o employees who have been there for 20+ years.  That says a lot about a company.
good,typical day was talking to agents and underwriting your book of business.  the work place was great. All the employees were easy to approach for help.
good,"Nice place to work as management is very focused, chance to learn, challenging work, latest tools and technologies etc."
good,This was a great company to work for. A regional carrier that thinks like a national. Investments in technology made this company stand out.
good,"I’m only contracting at Selective and find the company and people are amazing! Management cares about you, they are involved with community events and team building events."
good,"I interned at Selective for a summer as part of their Ignite program. My experience was incredible, I was always encouraged and supported by the employees I encountered. The program included paid time off, a volunteer day and encouraged a track to advance my career with Selective. There is also a free gym at the Branchville location!"
good,I had a great experience working at selective. there is a terrific work life balance depending on what level you are. there is a definite room for advancement.
good,"Receive and return phone calls to the medical facilities, adjusters and all other parties requesting the status and/or concerns about the medical bills."
good,Good company to work for. Good benefits and workplace culture. Management strives to presents opportunities for growth. Company is growing and expanding.
good,Got along with my peers. Some days were crazy and some weren’t. I relocated so had to quit. I would work there again.  Great hours.  If you had question about something someone in the department had the answer.
good,"At Selective Insurance I was able to contact 300 vendors to update and manage Selective Insurance’s claims vendor list. I was able to	attend corporate workshops on project management, leadership, and managing different personalities and generations in the workplace in order to have the ability to work as efficiently and effectively within in a team and succeed as a team; as well as learning traits, characteristics, and work ethics to become a successful leader.  Selective offers employees a family friendly atmosphere. Even as an intern at Selective I was able to make an impact for one of their programs."
good,Selective Insurance is a great company to work for. They treat their employees very well and with respect.
good,During this employment I learned how to become a purchaser of product for a large company for both in-house and out-of-house customers. The knowledge gained during that time will be with me always.
good,"The company itself is great.  Life outside of the corporate offices isn't like being at the corporate office, however, as you miss out on a lot of the perks they have."
good,I was very happy while working at Selective Insurance.  The company culture fit my working style and I performed well within the internship program.
good,"Everything about this company was great:  co-workers, management, training, pay, benefits, etc.  You came in, did your job, went home.  Work/life balance was starting to become a little more demanding, but wasn't terrible.  You could always go to a member of management with questions.  Other co-workers were always open to help."
good,"Selective Insurance offered an excellent environment, especially for the younger generation coming in. They embraced and worked with the changes of technology and having a work-life balance."
good,"great mid size company, not a lot of growth  upward but continuing education is affordable. yearly merits are given and bonus based upon performance are awarded."
good,"Great place to work, wish the were still in Columbus, oh. Was able to work myself up to a claims adjuster. Great supervisor and management."
good,"Coming into work in the morning, I did not feel stressed or worried about the day ahead. I was excited to work with the managers and achieve the tasks they assigned to me. The managers did an excellent job informing me on the bigger picture of these tasks as it made me feel part of something more. All the employees around my cubicle were friendly, inviting and were open to helping me with the task on hand. From the Seasonal Support job, I acquired substantial knowledge in the programs like Excel, Ariba and many others that were used daily by the Accountants. The job was challenging at times, but through the weeks, I became more adaptable and over came those challenges. For a Sophomore in college, I believe that I have acquired the experience that is necessary for me to apply that knowledge to any job in the business field."
good,"My typical day at work was easy going and productive. I worked mostly on the protective safeguard project and helped out with completing failed conditional errors. I learned how to do failed conditional errors, how to read and analyze safety surveys, and the basics of insurance. Management was great and extremely helpful. Whenever I had any questions, my supervisor was always willing to help answer them for me. Management was also very friendly and professional. The workplace culture was wonderful. Selective does bingo once a week and also has events such as volunteer days and employee appreciation day. The culture at Selective is very inclusive and enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was working with the safety surveys for the protective safeguard project, as some of the surveys did not provide all of the information needed to transfer over to the protective safeguard Excel sheet. The most enjoyable part of the job was the workplace culture and the people I worked with. Everyone was very helpful, insightful, knowledgable, and friendly."
good,"Great work life balance with flexible schedules and ability to work from home when needed. My manager is great overall. Also have a great work environment. Offices and or cubicle desks are nice with option for standing desks and community areas like a café and tables and meeting tables are easy to access and use. "
good,I began with Selective about a year ago and it has been a pleasant journey thus far.  Goals and expectations are clearly communicated and collaboration is at the heart of it.
good,"I got my start in insurance when I worked at Selective.  They are a great company and they are still in business today.  I worked in a small office and due to restructuring or downsizing our office was closed.  However Selective went over and above by offering counseling, head hunter services, etc.  They were very good to us.  They also offered for people to transfer to one of their other offices."
good,I would highly recommend a friend to work here. Management cares and there is a lot of room for career advancement. Benefits and salary are excellent.
good,The culture of Selective Insurance is inspiring.  Everyone in the office is helpful and pushes each other towards success. Teamwork is something they strive for as a company and was very proud to be apart of!
good,I enjoyed the challenges that I encountered with working with both agents and insureds.I had always met my job requirements and went above and beyond.
good,"The company has a conservative approach to business but the people are great. There is a feeling of horizontal management which is nice. PTO and pay are good, also the company offers strong stability."
good,Great Summer Internship Opportunity with many different groups to get familiar with. Lots of accounting learning experiences that you might not have elsewhere.
good,"Selective Insurance was a good company to work for, they were very fair in their benefits, time off and work schedule.  I would consider returning if the opportunity arose."
good,I loved everything about this company.  If I hadn't had to relocate I would still be there.  I started at the bottom and worked hard.  It was noticed and rewarded.  When I left I had multiplied my starting salary by 3.  Great opportunities there.
good,My average day would include various tasks from Audit Reviews to Policy Issuance. There is continuous communication between agents and myself which allows me to cultivate relationships with many within the insurance field.
good,"All the employees treated me like family. Best job ever, celebrated every occasion compsny picnics were the best! When I left I was given the best going away party ever! Left with gifts and cash! You guy's rock!"
good,A great team of employees to work with.   Very friendly atmosphere.  Employee recognition and  bounes awarded.  ACIP Awards given yearly for quota's met and company  participation.
good,"This was a wonderful place to work. I was always learning . We had many educational meetings for CEU'S as well as weekly meetings just to advise us on how we all as a TEAM were doing. Very family oriented company which was wonderful when my children were ill. Praise was always given by the administration for a job well done and great incentives for extra work and projects. Very busy company, but that what was what I thrived on. I loved this job and worked there until the company was sold."
good,"There is a lot to do day in and day out, however it is doable. There is a strong sense of camaraderie! I would recommend this workplace for anyone looking to get a work life balance!"
good,"5 day work week with a mix of field work, visiting clients & agents and report writing."
good,"I have worked with other insurance companies for over 25 years.  I have spoken to a lot of representatives in positions to Clerical to Vice Presidents at Insurance companies.  I have never seen more happier employees then those here at Selective.  Great place to work,  great benefits as well as the coworkers are by far the best in the Industry."
good,Work is typically very organized. Everyone has a job that they follow and the management and supervisors are usually very on top of things
good,"A very typical day at this project, when the functional document has modified and no extension of deadlines. Had to deliver the immediate day."
