bad,Be cautious if you are the only screener for a location. If you are be prepared to be on call every day of the year. The pay is below average for the same role at other locations in the area and not worth the time it demands and not being able to take vacation or sick days due to no backup coverage.
bad,This company has changed completely recently. They are only concerned with profits for themselves and investors. Majority of the work is in India because its cheaper. They value the money more than the quality of work. The majority of management and directors have no idea of their job roles. This company does not promote growth and is not a divers in the upper management department.
bad,"girl where do i beginnn?! I just left this job because my manager is unprofessional and lazy! Always making us accountable for everything thats not in our control. Seriously! How can you expect the team to be accountable for everything when manager cant even manage her own time. Girl how bout lets evaluate your time management skills huh because you tardy almost everyday for work! I learned my mamgers  culture, ikr too extra but i had to pretend that i like her to be her pet. True true to get away from doing the leg work. Yall im just saying yall that i followed my mammgers direction to “work smarter and not harder”  her favorite phrase. Being sarcastic if i may but i hate training themm yall. Straight up yall i smarted her out! Right?! Girl bye! I cant! Ugh its been a minute child! Glad to be out from that toxic raleigh cbo! I dont have to pretend no more!"
bad,"This company let me go due to “no cause of my own” over the phone and only after begging for an explanation of why I kept getting called off every day. In fact, I was never given a reason for being let go. However, I was not made to pay back my sign on bonus. Anyway, two years after collecting unemployment from this group, I was told I wasn’t eligible to work for this group indefinitely."
bad,Worst Company I have ever worked for. Horrible management lies on employees and stands over your shoulder. Plays favorites and hires lots of people with mental health issues. HR is a joke and unfamiliar with their own policies. Pay is extremely low. A lot of office drama
bad,"I am currently looking for a new job. This place has bee trouble since i started but I have been trying to see the light in the situation because, lets be honest no one likes job searching. I have had nothing but issues here with my hours, benefits, lack of knowledge by management, unnecessary reports and census tracking, my pay on top of being one of the most poorly run places i have ever worked for. My skills are too exceptional to settle for this place. I can not stay here and have officially re-entered the job market. My training was terrible, there is no employee support and no ethics. I just can't stay here."
bad,Poor management especially the director Lynn ....they lay people off quickly.....your job is not guaranteed.....its not a place i will work for again.
bad,"Writes you up for reasons ALREADY CLEARED. Does not care. Simple-minded crookedness and shallow management do NOT care about the truth."
bad,stressfully get 22 to 30 accounts on million dollar accounts that are impossible to get. because the accounts are old and ppl have worked on it and lied about calling so this makes the accounts dead and no money to collect and they hold it against the ppl who are honestly trying to fix the accounts no leaderhsip and poor management no communication. the manager is very unapproachable and very rude to everyone ans she shows favortism. she will direct someone else to to tell you something and your standing right there. the company is great but the managementis way thie turner over rates are horrible.
bad,"Words cannot explain how bad this place was, do yourself a favor and skip this company.  "
bad,"They operate from a base of fear. Too much training. They do not want experience or people who think, just do it their way."
bad,"dead end positions, lack of communication, checked out management, no perks for certain positions, favoritism, double standards, false promises, no organization, greedy"
bad,"All management cares about are numbers, they see you as a number and treat you like a number.  They are all talk about a close-knit group but this is farthest from the truth, don't fall for their promises, it sounds great in the beginning, especially bonuses, but expect to get little to nothing when it comes to promised compensation and bonuses, promises from working remotely at home, etc."
bad,I don't recommend that you work for this company. If you like to be abused then go ahead. I have never in my life worked for a worse company. The management is abusive to their employees and they have a click favoritism going on that make working for them a horrible experience.
bad,"The culture and atmosphere completely changes while I was there.  Top management was in process of gutting company, lowering pay, increasing work, and basically encouraging staff to leave without hiring replacements.  It was horrible."
bad,Management was horrific! i would never want to work there again not even if I got paid double. It has been by far the worst place i have ever worked at. Management degrades you and makes you feel like you are unvaluable employee. They want to over work you!
bad,Both managements kept saying they were going to change things but ended up having so many people quit that the work was never taken care of. Took so much time of them being sneaky that by “fixing” things resulted to them not actually knowing how to manage. It’s all about month end and petty incentives of parties that no one cares about to management. Maybe it’s to cover up that they have zero experience in managing anything.
bad,"Boring, routine, nothing new.  The hardest part of the job was doing the same boring thing, day in, day out.  The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out for the day."
bad,The manager sits in her office daily have no clue what's going on with the employees. Training is limited if you can deal with a lot of attitude and no support on training from management and lead rep. this job will be a perfect fit for you.
bad,The environment is chaotic. The management is unscrupulous. There is very little promotional opportunity. Lots of turnover. Bare minimum paid time off days. Minimal health care coverage which is surprising for a national medical group. Many unhappy people.
bad,"Worst job experience in my life. I would rather live in a cardboard box and eat catfood for the rest of my life than work for this company again. "
bad,The credentialing department at Mednax is the worse department I have ever worked for. The management would bring in their friends from previous employment and promotes them with 2 months before the veterans. I don't appreciate the favoritism that they show to their friends. They refuse to pay more so therefore I had to find new employment. The old management interacted better with everyone and was fair but they moved on themselves to something better. I don't think Credentialing will get any better as long as the director is in charge.
bad,I worked as a hearing screener for a year and the company sucks. The regional coordinator is very rude and tried to intimidate ppl. She never comes to help out when we're short staffed they have the poor coordinator working it all and of course making us work every wkend. They do not give you enough hrs and they lie to you about it in the beginning to keep you. It's way to much work for little pay and no hours and of course no benefits. And they hate the fact you are going to college to try to better yourself.
bad,"I ran! So did the director, managers, supervisor, and several other employees all ran. The company overall might be a decent place to work at, especially if you are a professional provider, however the credentialing dpt., what can I say? I ran!"
bad,"This company can care less about its employees, it only cares about enriching themselves and their shareholders.  Do not think that you will have an opportunity to advance, you will not-- as the majority of top-level positions are held by incompetent employees who are (and were) promoted because of who they know/their connections (including nepotism) and tenure.  These employees will be Vice-Presidents, Directors, etc., but worse, will make decisions and will never give you the opportunity to advance inside your department or move to another department.  And these same employees will do the least amount of work, and dump all the responsibilities on you-- to the point that your health will pay the price.  There is no work/life balance-- good luck taking your vacations or any time off.  HR policies are weak, and decisions are influenced by upper-management.  Sad to say that there are a lot of good people that go to work there, but leave as soon as they can.  Attrition level is almost at 100%, and management can care less.  If you have no choice or need an entry level job, take it and run as soon as you can.  But do not leave your current job to come to this company, you will regret it."
bad,"The credentialing dpt is the worse job I have ever had in my life. Those managers are nasty, and they can for the life of them keep their employees happy. Do yourself a favor, and do not work there. YOU WILL REGRET IT!"
bad,They are to set on the productivity of the employee's and aren't worried at all about Collecting money
bad,America Anesthesiology part of the comp is not good big time poorly management not a true leader. Follows Gossips of  other employees on the floor. That dept has ghetto people working there just to name a few. If you want to be unhappy. It's the place for you.
bad,I would rather not comment except to say that I would not recommend this place of employment to anyone. Management lacks professionalism and knowledge.
bad,"In last several years this FL based corporation has become horrific in all aspects. There are no core values. Employees are not treated with care or respect. Workplace motto is ""company first"". Policies are downright unethical. This leads to many employee write-ups whether justified or not. The mandatory overtime policy is just wrong. The constant micro-managing and bullying by management has driven many out with the highest turnover rate to date. You can have a high tolerance for all of this, but there comes a day when you say; ""DONE""; to this ""mean and all about the green"" of a workplace."
bad,"Pass on this I'd ur outgoing.  Very old style type mgmt no work life balance feels like a sweat shop or plantation just some succeed the very friendly and those who can be manipulated. Your work dedication and commitment doesnt matter. Lots of clique and wisphers. Some managers speak down to staff openly, some staff seen crying after being rough up. Disparity in pay by large amts. Not an inclusive environment, not friendly ppl."
bad,Bully extroidinare on board.  Made me not want to perform to my usual standards.  Once it affected my performance that's when I knew I had to go. Little did I know there were several before me that also left for the same reason. Why they put up with that behavior is beyond me.
bad,Difficult to work there.  Very toxic culture.  Executives have mostly been with company for decades and know things need to change but not positioned to actually do so.  Middle management very toxic and very little opportunity for advancement.
bad,"Top management was in the process of gutting staff when I left.  More work, less pay, less benefits, and horrible horrible morale.  It used to be a fun terrific atmosphere with advancement opportunities.  No more."
bad,"Original group bought out by Mednax/American Anesthesiology 3 years ago.  Very disorganized and poor communication between management and staff.  Pay grade typically well below average but recent increase only due to competition from other groups in town.  No weekend shift differential,  OT only paid after 7pm.   Sign on bonus given to new grads often made more than long time employees.   Office staff frequently makes errors with paycheck and hours so keep close track of your time.    No opportunity for advancement, or leadership, group will not have chief CRNA.  No CRNA on any committees.  This group brought Anesthesia assistants (AAs)  and AA school overnight with no input from long standing staff.   Lots of staff turnover , both MDAs and CRNAs.   Mostly AAs coming into this practice,  CRNAs will probably be minority in a few years.  Vacation is not seniority based (nothing here is).  Vacation selection is via random lottery.    If you like being one of the sheep, this is a perfect place for you.   If you want to use all of your abilities as a CRNA, look elsewhere."
bad,Poor training. Management is horrible. Hostile environment especially from Managers and supervisors. They hire their friends and promote them. Very unprofessional.
bad,The Physicians are rude. Special preference to some staff members. Outreach clinics so far.  The mileage pay does not help because always late 2 months out.
bad,Mednax seems to hire inexperience management. They are horrible and extremely biased. They only communicate with their favorites instead of being professional.
bad,Absolutely the WORST job I have ever had. I wanted to get into this for some medical experience but this was the worst company to try that with. They do not stand behind there employees & management was HORRIBLE. We could never get any new people to stay. Overworked & underpaid. Stay away from this company.
bad,"Take heed of companies who have leaders who have been there since the organization was created. Typically this means that the people at the top of the food chain are most resistant to change. This also means that those leaders more than likely received their role for being loyal, as opposed to having mentorship qualities with innovative and adaptable characteristics."
bad,"Company has abandoned all that made it a great place to work 10 years ago, in favor of hiring more Vice Presidents who don’t know much.  Demand everything but provide nothing."
bad,When I was first hired I was told my supervisor will be training me. That was a lie. The manger doesn't know the job yet therefore I'm was forced to rely on rude coworkers who really don't want to help you. And will set you up for failure. Long story short if you're not latino you'll fend for yourself. Also their billing system is horrendous and old. Its constantly freezing and you have to wait the next day for billing to drop in. Overall not good first impression.
bad,"The management does not care about patient care, only profit. Hired different managers for different positions with no  knowledge of how a good medical office should run, i worked gor a physician for 11 yrs there that was great i loved my patients and vice versa"
bad,"Uneducated, untrained management who are threatened by educated subordinates. Will do much to ruin your reputation and impede any chance to advance. "
bad,Everyone on Management are friends. So there's no such thing as open door policy because the next manager will already know what you discussed. Plus company has no structure
bad,"As a locums tenens medical professional, pay is abysmal.  Communication with the executive offices is almost impossible; no one responds to calls or emails.  The credentialing process goes on for months because of this.  Once you start your job, there is no support.  You are thrown into a very disorganized atmosphere to sink or swim on your own."
bad,"I worked there briefly and left after 6 weeks because the staff there is extremely unprofessional! I was hired as a ""medical biller"" and ended up doing ""insurance verification"" as well as everybody's gofer. Most of the women there are rude and not helpful"
bad,"Unprofessional, high school “mean girls” environment. No training or room for growth. So far every other department I’ve interacted with has been stellar compared to this department."
bad,They have outsourced their coding to India leaving their coder with no jobs. The manager state she was going to help but offered no assistance. Not a person of her word.  If you are looking for stability look the other way.
bad,"I worked there very very briefly and I was hired as a “Medical Biller” and spent most of my time in a file room and doing grunt work. Coworkers were rude and not helpful at all.  I was there 2 1/2 weeks with no access to the systems and had to deal with IT on my own with very little to no help from anyone.  I spent most of my time in a file room where one particular day I was in there 5 hrs straight and no one even checked on me.  Then I was humiliated in a meeting, thanks to my trainer, by a physician in the office who had seen me in the office and the file rooms and all she could say was I wondered who she was and apparently everyone thought that was funny.  I have been in medical billing for 18 yrs and this by far was the worse place ever.  My “trainer” spent maybe 10 minutes total with me training and when I would ask questions, new system for me, she would just say go here here and here...... seriously!!!! I don’t even know how you got to here let alone here and here.  I had never been made to feel more stupid in all my life.  I turned down another job to go here and that was the biggest mistake of my life.  I would NEVER suggest anyone work here."
bad,"Hostility, bullying by upper management is tolerated. Reporting does not effect change of behavior. Little to no praise for a job well done. Abuse exempt employees by working long hours so no to have to pay over time."
bad,"Low morale, bullying, significant disconnect between managers and their employees; management typically hasn't a clue what certain processes actually entail. They justify juvenile and hostile behavior. No organization or real guidance...just a flat out nightmare."
bad,"Management favors only certain people and it is evident. They also visibly shop, Facebook and text on their phones during meetings and workshops which is insulting to the presenter and a poor display of teamwork and leadership. I'm amazed that these women are in the positions they are in."
bad,"good working conditions, great people, low pay."
bad,"When I started 10 yrs ago this was a AWESOME place to work. Management was great from Upper Management to team lead. Since our Director retired and the new one came on board, the Raleigh office has become a HORRIBLE place to work. The New director and the 2 managers that the director has hired bc she knew them are TOTALLY unqualified and incompetent of the  anesthesia billing process, and REFUSE to learn, from the employees who have done this work for the past 5-20 yrs. The moral, communication, and everything about the Raleigh office has gone from awesomeness to heartbreaking. The Director and the 2 Managers in the AR department seem determined to tear down the department. The communication we once had is now DEAD, along with rules of protocol, which have been taken over by favoritism, from this new management  team. I hope Mednax will began to CLOSELY screen candidates for Directors and upper management going forward."
bad,Culture is horrible.  Management is quick to point the finger but will not admit to their mistakes.  Individuals who have been with the company for many years use their power for intimidation because they know they are not going anywhere.  Low pay yet given many projects above pay grade.
bad,"If you enjoy being disrespected by nursing staff, and your own manager, because they are afraid of losing the contract with the hospital this job is for you."
bad,"So many secret changes going on with the company  They leave all the employees in the dark and you never know if you’ll have a job the next day or not. Management is poor and lack basic communication skills.  They are emotionally driven, is you do something they don’t like they pay not speak to you for the next few days.  The work is easy but things change so often and you never know until they are calling you out on doing something wrong   When all along you had no idea of the changes .  This place is a joke"
bad,Bad place to work ... Run!!!!!!!!! There are employee who truly try to make a difference an get the job done. You do all the work while the un knowledgeable boss get the bonus . You even pay for your own Christmas party need I say more.
bad,"Mednax is top heavy. Too many in leadership roles have been around too long. Culture is horrific and is not going to change. It's a look the other way organization. Physicians do as they please. High ranking staff run things how they want. A lot of talk but no action. Complete waste of time with this company. Get out before you become stuck, miserable and complacent to the point you offend your own ethics which will destroy your confidence and ambition to go elsewhere."
bad,Do not even think about it.  Mednax somehow manages to be the most dreadful company I have ever worked for.  They do NOT support their practices which leads to extreme turnover and contract losses.  Company is about 15 years behind the 8 ball.
bad,Was terminated due to poor job performance however workload was way too high for one person & when asked for help nothing was done until it was too late; poor management within the department; Systems failed frequently & IT or the helpdesk was never helpful; HR was out of state so it was hard to report issues within the company plus HR would never contact you back after reaching out; Ridiculous hours of overtime was expected & mandated weekly; Management showed favoritism; Company doesn't care about their employees or their families; Bonus disbursements was not fair or at times was up to manager's discretion but was required to contribute towards the bonus; Will receive an occurrence when you can't make it in during inclement weather & also if you get sick.....
bad,"Poor management. The management has unprofessional issues with other departments within the company, which make it hard on the department itself. No work life balance, micromanagement is common. No real training and rude management. "
bad,If you want to work 1 day a week and every other weekend and get paid every two weeks then this job is for you. No one can make a living with this job. Your not guaranteed hours. You could work 8 hours or be there 10 minutes in one day. Your never guaranteed days or hours. If you need a job that you can depend on and for sure have days to work and hours on a pay check then keep looking for a different job. This isn’t for you.  OTHER than that I loved the job working with the newborns it was a great experience. Just not enough days or hours
bad,"The company of Mednax has gotten to big for a ""little"" company to handle.  They can't seem to communicate between the corporate office and the regional offices so managers here just make up their own rules which change on a daily bases.  The managers here have no say because they are governed by two RPAM's that are bully's and are horrible at managing.  They treat people with such lack of respect, they speak rudely to the employees out in the open for all to hear.  Because of them the managers are stressed and in turn treat their employees badly.  This has been brought to corporate's attention numerous times and nothing has happened.  The policy of Mednax is that absolutely no retaliation is to happen when a complaint is made this is totally false,  retaliation is a daily issue for those who have complained about the working conditions. Management needs a total overhaul starting with the RPAM's.  The turn around here should be a sign that things are hostile here."
bad,"I was hired as a Newborn Hearing Screener, due to start in two days. After running around like crazy getting everything ready for two weeks, they advised me TODAY that they have decided not to hire me."
bad,Mediocre manager  stay away too much manager don’t know what they are doing layoffs  wave more managers than employee  Every day they keep changing stuff split the CBO it’s basically like a foster child you never know what to expect every day there’s more changes so much manager all they do is stay in meeting the team lead tried to run department HR does not know handbook HR defend manager it’s just politics very bad company stay away
bad,"A Typical work day is very stressful, Deadline orientated but employees are expected to do 100% with very little resources. Management needs training and the on the job training was not the best. There is no assistance when needed and lots of favoritism."
bad,"During my time with Mednax there was constant change and lack of direction. Senior management makes hasty decisions with lack of regard of the outcome in mind. The company is only concerned with making money and could care less about how they do it. They have offshored the coding and AR to India and will continue to send more, and more of the work to India They can get the work done for a fraction of what they are paying state side employees. There is no HR support and the culture is absolutely toxic."
bad,Received 2 weeks of training when asked for more was told didn’t need it. Constantly changing the way things should be done. System would freeze up frequently
bad,"Job description does not match the actual job experience you actually got. Data entry with minimal analysis of data that is already in the system, is the description that should be posted for this position."
bad,"The company as a whole seems great. Great PTO, good benefits but the individual practices is another story. How does someone with no healthcare background make more than someone with years of experience? Well because the other person speaks Spanish. I didnt have to ask I just sat back and listened. "
bad,"The management is incompetent and two faced, you will never have job security, and the co-workers at least at the Frederick location are the worst, they have turned that office into a soul sucking venomous pit of hell..unless you enjoy dying a little inside each day, stay away from this middle school drama filled hell!!! Just a warning, it is treacherous:/"
bad,"The company was great to work with and I loved working at the location in Greenville. With that being said, my boss was not a good coworker. She was very unprofessional."
bad,"When our department old director left, the entire department left when the new director came on board.Founation was racist, controlling, she even told me to recite back to her what she told me. She harasses the employees, she needed to account for every minute of every second of the day. She is condescending and zero flexibility. They refused to pay me for a higher paying position that was vacant."
bad,The company seems professional at first but behind the facade are people who have worked there for years that will stop you from growing and moving forward.  This company is not open to change and good employees have to leave to progress.  Also advancement seems to happen only to friends of friends so working hard and being good at your job doesn't count for much.
bad,"Company has major turnover issues. They have no loyalty to employees. I stuck it out with them when they had tons of open positions and could not fill them. Management begged me not to quit too. 3 managers in 1 year. Bounced from region to region to different team. Handled duties for jobs that people quit. Often worked through lunch. No space between projects. Then was ""laid off"" when they built their team up. Some nice co workers amd some really nasty ones."
bad,"Overall the company is fun if you have a good manager and supervisor.   The problem is there are many leads who think they are managers and treat staff with disrespect out in the open.  "
bad,"Hostility, bullying by upper management is tolerated.  Reporting does not effect change of behavior.  Little to no praise for a job well done.  Abuse exempt employees by working long hours so no to have to pay over time."
bad,The day could be very busy or very slow to many changes on polices.  Census tracking and Registering and Billing and Re-Billing accounts.  Verifying all insurances.
bad,Managment definitely need to be trained on how to treat their employees.   Especially learn how to talk to the employees when they are under stress.  It would be a great place to work if the managers wasnt so cut throught.
bad,Good old boys/girls network; managers promoted by friends. There is resentment towards employees with upper degrees and a desire to squash them. Management needs training.
bad,"Decisions change on a daily basis.  Upper  Management does not appear to think things thru completion. New management has no experience in the specialty.  Your co-workers will stab you in the back will giving you a kiss.  Higher management encourages employees to complain about their supervisors and encourages gossip. "
bad,"On the outside the job looks great, benefits are good, etc., but they really could care less about your onboarding. Frequently I had to follow up, the manager did not want to be bothered and they could care less that they did not pay me on time and then lost my check- it took me 10 days past pay day and numerous phone calls to get my first paycheck! Then my manager was mad at me even though it had nothing to do with me at all. This is what I am referring to- they will not take any responsibility for their actions, and resent you if you ask questions or try to do the right thing. "
bad,Horrible Management - New management every 6 months to a year -  would come in and change everything that worked because they could -without any really assessment of the daily operation.
bad,"I love being able to be with my patients, and working with many different hospitals. I am looking for other positions due to no growth and management."
bad,"management was very unprofessional, he didnt know what he was doing. i didn't like working with the manager. unprofessional. please u don't know. don't know don't know. manager didn't know the job."
bad,"Have never had mandatory overtime in any of my previous jobs.  And when it wasn't mandatory it was more of a ""voluntold"" instead of volunteer.  You were made to feel guilty for trying to have a work life balance."
bad,"Company pays lip service to collaborative practice. Improving patient care. In truth, none of this filters to practice. Company exists to cherry pick profitable practices and skim off profits. Be wary if takeover target. You will soon have no voice in your practice and be subject to direction by those with little or no sense for the practice of anesthesia or how a group actually operates, day to day, in the trenches."
bad,"Mednax is a below satisfactory company to work for. The employees are great however, management can be severely unprofessional, critical and dishearting. The work level stress is above tolerable and often causes much concern whether on or off the clock. This company requires a great deal of improvement."
bad,"Great benefits, work/life balance.  Management doesn't own up to their mistakes and throws others under the bus.  Micromanages.  No recognition for a job well done. Focus only on minor mistakes."
bad,"The only thing good about this company is Flex time (you can go to work anytime between 7-9 as long as you complete 8 hours), great benefits, PTO, Bonuses, and the fact that when the doors closed for any reason, you will still get paid 8 hours without using your PTO. Management is horrible, training is limited, they work you like slaves because the denials are out of control and the volume of turnarounds are low. We were always doing spreadsheets and adjusting off so much money due to lack of training and management not knowing there jobs. They get rid of the good workers and keep the bad ones. The system used is so old. almost everyone uses Epic but Mednax. Which is why they can not get ahead. They are always losing contracts and getting rid of departments. Your job is not secured at all. The quota or production numbers are unreachable. Coders please beware...the coding manager is evil. I have heard her call her coders stupid. She yells at them like they are children. The new RPAM for AR said he is going to clean up but I don't think there is any help for that company. I left due to poor management, no job stability, and pay. Mednax is the lowest paying company. Although, the work can be done from home, they do not offer Work from home opportunities. It is so miserable there due to the fact that they are not equipped to help you succeed in doing quality work and management ride you so bad over things that are not in your control. They care more about quantity than quality. Please take my advice and run. There are other places you can work and not have to be stressed out or"
bad,"- Most of those in upper management have been in those roles for 10 + years. This has led to a ""what I say goes"" mentality. Current management does not care for employees or their wellbeing. The company has employees with great potential, however, poor management is enough them to drive their motivation and ethics out. Mednax will see great improvement the moment they introduce new management. Individuals with a different way of thinking - open, flexible, reasonable, and understanding."
bad,"Worked for MEDNAX and built my career there.  In the beginning was an amazing family feel work environment.  In the past 10 years that feel is gone.  Employee turnaround is high and and the scale of management that is hired along with the promotions of within to  Regional Directors, or Corporate directors has taken on a poor attitude.  Company boasts of an open door policy however that is non existent."
bad,"I have worked for Mednax for over 9 years.The benefits are super and love the flex time. Management is not mature, it is who you know instead of what you know. Many incompetent people in positions because of their relationships.The company does not stand behind there employees they want quantity over quality. I am truly sad at how much things have changed from caring for your employees to not caring at all Just work."
bad,"Company was recently taken over by mednax. Lazy entitled drs expect to get paid for not working. Benefits include, no reqired overtime or weekends.  Job is salary and there is no compensation for working over 40 hours per week.  Salary is below aveerage. Enough said"
bad,"Mednax is a medical services company; though it employs many clinical staff and provides technical services for healthcare, it's a business services operation.  "
bad,"I have fought for many employees , including myself for better wages and have constantly been denied. They took away raises in 2018. They have let people go without the proper procedure and then have been dishonest about their procedures"
bad,Staff and management were unhappy and angry.  Management led by bullying and personal attacks.  Uncomfortable place to work and unnecessary stress was produced by poor management style.
bad,"Company acquires medical practices and often inherits toxic workplace and dysfunctional leadership environments.  They look the other way and allow the chaotic culture to continue to fester. This is a physician run company and they will not stand up to physicians regardless of the physician engaging in bad behavior that could cost the company."
bad,"Great company, PTO, Pay, Professionalism.  Poor management skills.  Have and have nots. Some  professionals seemed angry all the time. Tempers flared."
bad,"Good place to work however pay is on the lower end of compensation, they would rather save money then keep people who know what the business needs."
bad,This company represents no culture values at all. The worst place worked in all the years I have worked. Never once been in such a horrible position. Never thought Management would lie and get away with it all to get rid of someone. The management team are very disorganized and dysfunctional. If you don’t fit into their alliance then you will be out of a job. No support and very demeaning environment. Overheard boss talking about doctors and Director to outside vendor which is very unprofessional. The vendors chime in only to discredit the person as not being fit. Do not join. The last two Directors last only months and both came with a lot of experience. Leadership place unrealistic expectations on staff and their is no building up to make workplace better. Micromanage boss who expects you to work and be like your counterparts. Will constantly compare and make you feel incompetent. No one is happy with the company and feels it is losing their reputation with services to facilities.
bad,"It is a pretty ok place to work, I am ready for growth and less stress. The moral of the company is not that great which is why so many employees are leaving"
bad,"I worked for Mednax for over 8 years and the last 2 were my worst job ever.  They have become too big and have forgotten about their employees.  Management is HORRIBLE!! Mednax needs to evaluate their employees opinion about the managers there.  We had made several complaints to the corporate office with even a visit from corporate HR but nothing was done.  the same horrible, managers are still there."
bad,Resigned from a job of four years to work for Mednax one of the worst mistakes of my life. While in training for several weeks previous work was not being kept up. When completed training management expected me to catch up previous work plus work that was coming in 7 days a week. When asked for help was ignored then they assigned me another facility.  Put in my two week notice on a Friday morning that afternoon before leaving they told me they would not need me for the two weeks. Management for that department spiteful and no compassion. It's all about who has more power and not about empowering the employees.
bad,This could be a great place to work if you were hired as a full-time employee. Most everyone is a part-time employee who works 40+ hours a week. The job was enjoyable and stressful but in a good way.
bad,"Management for that department spiteful and no compassion. It's all about who has more power and not about empowering the employees.  Horrible management, mistreatment of employees overlooked when addressed, you are a number not a person, hostile work environment.  The manager sits in her office daily have no clue what's going on with the employees. Training is limited if you can deal with a lot of attitude and no support on training from management and lead rep. this job will be a perfect fit for you."
bad,"Help customer with processing payment, setting up arrangement on the account so patient can pay monthly. Courtesy calls to patient reminding of monthly payments."
good,"The people at mednax are great. I worked there for 3 years and loved the people I worked with. The issue is management don't often lead by example. If you have a difference in opinion from your manager or director you will be fired. If you want to advance your career and move to another department and you are not one of the liked people you will not get promoted or you will be fired. "
good,Management does not provide flexible shifts... which is unfair because this is the only cbo that does not give flexibility. It makes it harder to complete OT hours throughout the week.
good,The culture and atmosphere does not promote growth or an appreciation of new ideas and advancement towards better technology.
good,"Great atmosphere to work in, Great employees and moral, wonderful opportunity for individuals looking for growth and stability in the administrative side of healthcare."
good,"Too paper oriented not automated enough. Have very high expectations of employees. Expect employees to be perfect. No errors, meet daily quotas. Don't  pay enough for the stress"
good,"Management is top heavy and the vast majority at the time of my employment were all incumbents from the founding days of the company.   One needed insider connections, and I made friends but there was little upward or lateral opportunities.  "
good,I worked for this company for almost 4 years. But one day I had enough and I quit on the spot. The hours are all over the place. I worked New Year's Day 2015 and I had 30 babies to test not including NICU. I went in early knowing that I was alone that day and I worked 12 hrs! I tested every single baby that day. It was exhausting. When I first started I had a nice caring manager. Then I got moved to another hospital and well things took a turn once I moved and one day I just snapped. And I don't regret it at all!
good,Management has no idea how to manage.  Bullying is commonplace.  Little integrity in management.  Growing too fast. Pay was average.  Fairly good benefits.
good,"Mednax overall might be considered a good place to be employed depending which department the employee is in.  The long timers tend do fine but will change departments when it is necessary to avoid disaster.  Very little training if any, mentoring or guidance is slim to none.  Job Work/Life Balance needs some review from HR in some departments."
good,"Great company that started small and is growing but losing employees at the same time. Mednax has to take better care of their loyal employees, no incentives and very little pay."
good,"After numerous attempts to promote within the company, it took FOREVER! I was the lowest paid person in my department while others were paid way more but were there less time than I was. Upper management was ridiculous. TONS of CONSTANT changes.  Believe me when say RUN!!!"
good,"Company offers amazing benefits including PTO, stock options. The work is endless there is unlimited overtime. Wish the communication from management was better"
good,There is such a lack of training there is no manuel it's word by mouth and you  need to be an excellent note taker or you will miss something that yon should know.
good,"Mednax is over-all a good company. However, the Sunrise CBO is not the best location to work. Collections managers and team leads do not know the RCM process as well as they should. Employees are not motivated to do their jobs effectively as management does not recognize when an employee goes above and beyond to achieve the company's goals. Those employees who have worked diligently, are taken off of projects they have taken responsibility and accountability for and made to work another employee's assignments just to get that employee caught up with their productivity. Additionally, managers apply unfair policies to some employees while over-looking, or completely ignoring the same actions taken by the employees who do not meet productivity requirements. When the company laid-off employees, those employees who do nothing stayed and a couple of really productive employees were terminated. The CBO is riding on the work ethics of very few individuals who truly are great people. The others take credit for work they have not done."
good,"Mednex is a very busy work place, with several departments that must pull together to meet the daliy work goals. The staff is made up of a very work oriented staff that meets the goals at the end of the month."
good,"Processed New Hire, Acquisitions and Re credentialing applications to obtain state license and hospital privileges on behalf of the new and existing providers as needed to process the applications.  Generated and sent hospital verifications letters needed for licensure. Complete all necessary and appropriate forms for Primary Source Verifications and file in preparation for Committee for review and approval.  Document all tasks, phone calls, emails, and other forms of communication during the credentialing and credentialing process in IntelCred and Internal Spreadsheets"
good,"Sales tax and property tax daily"
good,"The company as a whole is a good company but the office I'm located at is the worst. Promotions are awarded to the popular, the clueless, and those who keep tabs on their coworkers and report them. The work is tedious and can be overwhelming in its large volume, to the point that it seems as if 8hrs a day, five days a week is not enough time to complete your work. Unfortunately management does not value intelligent employees and new ideas, they see it as a personal challenge and will become hostile towards you. Its a great place to work if you don't have any small children and love office high school drama. Its sad when coworkers are bullied and even worse when superiors participate in it."
good,"The typical day at Mednax is 8 hours. I really learned alot working there and will go back if the CBO was closing. The hardest part of the job is the productivity. It can be hard at times, but is doable if focused."
good,Typical work day starts now at 7am and we grind all day long. All working to accomplish a common the goal of success in all the aspects of our business. I have learned a great deal of information about billing and collections. This knowledge is something I welcome and can use in other endeavors of my work life.
good,"I enjoyed working at Mednax as a hearing screener , but there is no set hours . You can come in and have only 5 babies to screen which may take 2 hours . Sometimes my co workers and i will screen a baby every hour in order to get a ""full day of work in "". There are no benefits for part time screener and we do not get recognized for the amount of work that we do. This job is great if you just want the experience but it is not a job that i will get if you have responsibilities and need to pay bills. You have to work smart as a screener , the company thinks that they can play you but you need to play them. If you have 10 babies screen every 30 mins, & take breaks in order to get a full 8 hours in . Yes its that serious but the staff at my hospital were great ."
good,In my previous position my typical work would be traveling to new practices helping to establish them within the MEDNAX family.
good,Busy Busy Busy Place. Constant changes and volume of work continues to rise. Secure job. Co- workers are nice. Learned a lot of acquisitions and new hires process and flow.
good,"Very structured by policies which provides a strong platform for managers. Off shoring jobs and severe reduction with staff creates issues. Slow to hire when needed,"
good,"I really loved my job and the people I worked with at the hospital. The anesthetists have a lot of autonomy. There are diverse and challenging cases including neuro, vascular, trauma and OB."
good,disinterested in this solicitation request.
good,". Everyone wants a title, to be a title in the company and not really wanting to do the work. Pounding at the people to work harder and quick to point blame and not able to stand up as leaders."
good,"Company great, communication and training could be better.  Managment is ok, team is very quiet. Team could do better as far as comong together to get tue posting completed before month end close."
good,"The team members  that are the lowest on the totem make a lot less than others in their field.  This would be a great place to work if opportunities to grow with the company was based on skills/experiences and not on ""who you know"" or if you are well liked."
good,"When I first started I absolutely loved the job. I loved helping families and working with newborns. The job is very simple and straightforward. The pay is reasonable the only problem is that you never know how many hours you will be working. You can go in one day and work 8 hours or 10 minutes. The last months I worked here I started to dread going into work. The specific hospital I worked in had the rudest nurses, nurse practitioners, and doctors I have ever met. They will act superior to you, say that your job is not important, and if you ever have a question they will ignore you or make a snarky remark. It got to the point where they didn't care if they treated you this way in front of parents. It was not only disrespectful but extremely unprofessional. I only met with the regional coordinator once and she was just awful and clueless. A new coordinator was hired  that was in charge of the hospital I worked for and she was very nice but also clueless. If you needed her help her response was always to call the help desk or she was busy. If the management was improved the company would do a lot better. And hospitals need to treat everyone with respect regardless of what their role in the hospital is."
good,This company is great to work for and requires you to be able to adapt to a Fast pace environment and the ability to  re- prioritizing constantly. Team work is a must.
good,I would recommend anyone work here. Management was all about employees and making sure that we had the tools to do our job. I loved having the option of coming into work between the hours of 7 to 9 am.
good,Productive working environment with opportunity for growth . A lot of time spent on the phones. Management is fair and accessible. insurance company calling is exasperating.
good,Need a new Patient Accounting System. Currently using a 40yr old system.  Outdated reporting platform. Currently undergoing major changes  to a new patient accounting system. Undergoing major reduction in work force.
good,"Upper management has been making changes to our work flow without test them, allowing us to fall behind and they expect us to be current. No training and if it it is a new trainee is hired."
good,"new offices integration planning, hardware and software preparation and support"
good,"At this job you work individually. I really enjoyed my job but when there was room for advancement, they pushed me out the door. I was there best hearing screener in that area, but they refused to even talk to me about advancement. If it wasn't for that I would probably still be there."
good,work life balance is good at this company.  Career path needs some work as not well defined in any department at any level.  Compensation is above the average market.
good,"Good place to work, no advancement opportunities. Good employee benefits"
good,The atmosphere is quiet. Once you clock in your working right away and before you know it it's time to go home. Communication is not always expressed. It can feel like high school sometimes with people gossiping including managers. There is no room for career advancement.
good,"I enjoyed working with my fellow co-workers, we were provided with good medical benefits and flexible work hours. The company had special events to keep moral high."
good,"High volume work load."
good,Good place to start your career and then move on. Long term / advancement will be difficult to do preferential treatment and weak HR policy.
good,Weekly and daily deadlines. Heavy work load with focus on high productivity.  Mandatory and voluntary overtime required frequently in order to meet Corporate's goals for billing cycle. Promotion offered internally and opportunity to advance and grow.
good,Regardless what was going on whether good or bad I chose to have a positive view. I did not let the environment dictate my feelings or how I would respond to certain things. I made the best and gave my best at everything I set out to do.
good,"I felt that my skills were under utilized. "
good,"I learned a lot of HR procedures from Mednax."
good,"The coordinator that I worked with does not care so much about the employees. She can be rude at times and you feel like you're always in trouble. Negative feelings everytime she's around, which is why I quit. However, I did like the flexibility that they offer and the pay was ok if you are looking for a side job."
good,"Very busy daily work load. How to stay organized and plan out my work day, Management could use some people skills. They company  is pretty laid back. Keeping on top of reporting can be a little stressful sometimes. Working indiviually"
good,Staff members are required to train themselves mostly. There is not much follow up on how associates are doing with their work load in most departments.
good,"As far as workplaces go, Mednax is an OK place to work... the best benefit is the amount of PTO per month given. It's a fast-paced environment, there's always something to do."
good,"There is a great work-life balance. The company does offer many benefits to their employees, full medical coverage, life insurance and stock options."
good,"* A typical day for me is arriving at the office early and making people smile throughout the day. I provide people a service of creating SharePoint sites with everything needed to make their days and processes simpler."
good,The job as newborn hearing screen coordinator is a special and important job that is amazing to be apart of. Building relationships within the hospital with doctors and nurses is a fantastic way to build your resume. The hardest part of the job is not getting compensated financial for your efforts.
good,Time flies at this job. Training is a month long and it is a lot to learn in a very short time. I think the pay is great. It takes a long time for management to be able to help on certain calls so the patients can get very upset at times.
good,Everyday work was very challenging which exceled my skills in automation and manual testing. Management and co-workers were very nice to work with.
good,Company needs to improve their processes. They make it hard at times to do your job was my biggest frustration other than the pay. Women for the most part make up management which is great because they are understanding of the work life balance. However they do not do what is needed to improve processes. Monthly goals are rarely met (bonuses) which effects pay and made me decide to leave
good,Fast paced and extremely busy CBO.  Very positive culture changes. Learning how to be a large company versus a local mom and pop with expected growing pains.
good,"In general, culture is great, but some managers are micro-managers, they don't plan, they just approach projects with unjustified OT. Non IT managers, leading IT efforts."
good,Mednax provides those individuals who work hard the opportunity to grow and learn a great deal. The organization has been through many changes and it continues to focus on the patient first mission.
good,Primarily Microsoft shop and and proprietary technology. Lots of .NET. Teams have good camaraderie but the teams are actively working to reduce existing distrust between units.
good,"The company is a good company to work for but like every company there are flaws, they do not pay enough for the amount of work. Mednax just needs to evaluate the systems that the people work in and allow the system to do more work and not the people."
good,It was a position that required multi-tasking between 13-16 employees and their 24 facility locations.  Traveling frequently throughout the state of Texas and Louisiana for on site staff reviews and training.
good,"Extremely fast paced environment with the opportunity for overtime. But, unfortunately, there isn't room for advancement in this type of position. But, overall, Mednax has been a good organization to work for."
good,I enjoyed working at Presbyterian Hospital and doing hearing screenings on our babies!  I enjoyed meeting the parents and doing the screening.  A nice job in my opinion!
good,"It was a great company until there was a change in administration during 2016.  Prior to the change, overall employees enjoyed coming to work and putting their best efforts forward.  After the change, the employees feel threatened."
good,"This job is a great way to gain experience and work actively in a hospital setting, while still having a great amount of scheduling flexibility. It has been the perfect job while attending school, for further education in the health care field."
good,Mednax has experienced significant growth mainly by acquisition and the rapidity of the growth has caused stress within the organization.  The benefits are competitive and vacation policy is primarily based on physician plans.   A significant portion of management's background comes from within the medical community so there is little mentoring and everyone is expected to work extra.  Life balance does not come during the regular work week.
good,"Great job, billing specialist, great employees, hard workers, push for excellence. I would definitely recommend this job to anyone who is looking for work in the medical field. "
good,For the amount of work and time I spend at work I think the salary could be way better considering my cost of living in my area. With kids in school and bills I need more
good,"As a part time newborn hearing screeener, you have to be an independent worker who can solve your own problems. Tech support and employee manual is everything you need. -  Your supervisor may not be able to respond immediately if she is busy.  "
good,"There is not a typical day in this office. The physicians here care for high risk pregnancy patients and their outcomes are sometimes the most rewarding and also the most difficult part about this position. Regardless, every effort is worth it."
good,It is great workplace in which you would want to come to work everyday. Not  a very stressful environment even though you must make your productivity.
good,"I had no prior knowledge of provider enrollment before I started working at Mednax. Since working at Mednax I have acquired a lot of know about enrolling providers and how the credentialing and contracting  process work, in order to get providers paid correctly."
good,"Would recommend working for Mednax working with patients and insurance was part of the billing along with reports but revenue monthly reached goals"
good,"Assessed all providers coming on board and ensure all documents needed to enroll the provider was received. Requested and completed all necessary and appropriate enrollment forms for submission to the proper health plans. Communicated with health plans to understand the process and use of information to establish and maintain estimated effective dates for providers.  Maintained and updated database with both enrollment status and necessary data elements.  Documented all tasks, phone calls, emails and other forms of communication during the enrollment process in the database.  Conducted written and oral follow up to determine application status.  Escalated all issues to the appropriate members of the management staff, region, and/or co-workers as necessary.  Responded promptly to all questions, received via phone or email, regarding any health plan and/or group/pin.  Completed and updated the CAQH database when necessary.  Communicated with all necessary internal departments regarding status of enrollments. Scanned and indexed completed applications.  Developed and maintained relationships with individual contacts for the government agencies as well as managed care organizations.  Prepared updates upon completion of enrollment and forward with pin and/or group numbers to our collections teams."
good,There were a few management problems when i used to work here but all those problems are gone. Too bad i didn't stay enough to see the changes. I heard it is a better place to work now.
good,"Great work/life Balance. "
good,Fast paced.  Expect constant change. File claims.  Call insurance.  Monthly meetings.  Morale committee.   Sawgrass Mall.  Panthers Arena.  Sawgrass Expressway.
good,The overall corporate structure is solid even during a reorganization.  Satellite office has some internal struggles but overall very supportive of its employees with opportunities to learn and grow.  Is a VERY demanding job not without inconsistencies in processes.  Corporate personnel are extremely knowledgeable and willing to assist and share their wealth of knowledge and support.  Everyone works to an overall goal of making the person and corporation succeed.  It can be difficult to meet the competing demands from multiple sources and overtime is often needed.
good,I have learned working well under pressure gets me through the day. Working as a team player and bringing great ideals to the company was a goo experience.
good,"A typical day consisted of support for our regional locations as a second tier support for electronic claim submission issues.  Also consisted of being the lead on several projects being implemented, which consisted of leading and coordinating project team status calls and calls with vendors"
good,"Good organization in the acquisition and startup sector. Has been able to secure a very good national foot print. Day to day operations at corp. is very busy and you need the ""go getter"" mind frame to get things done. "
good,"Solid, smart organization.  Competitive benefits and pay.  Great people, family oriented, healthy culture.  Overall nice place to work."
good,"I worked as a Contract Employee. My team and Supervisor's always treated  with respect. I was sad to see it end. "
good,Good place to gain experience and excel in growth. Understanding work life balance. Very different environment from other healthcare organizations in the surrounding areas.
good,Mednax was a great place to work. Willingness of management to teach when employees are willing. Great compensation and quarterly bonuses a plus. Great benefits
good,I am excited about retuning to MEDNAX. It is a great company that is going through some transformations as is every large enterprise in South Florida.
good,"I worked with Mednax for 34 years, started with the company when there was only 4 physicians.  It was great to work with them as the company grow. They have work environment that feels like a family."
good,This is a dynamic company and has significant opportunities. The service lines and management structure are varied and include pediatric and adult fields.  A good place to start and a good place to bring skills
good,"This CBO was not in good standing at first, it has gotten better in the last 6 months to a year at this point. It's a good company to work for and the benefits, but they do need to improve on their training methods."
good,"I enjoyed this job because it kept me busy all day. Although I felt like an outsider as a temp employee , the employees were very nice. As a temp, no overtime was allowed. All perm employees were allowed to utilize overtime to handle their work load"
good,Being a coordinator is a great position to be in. Although the training  is not extensive i feel that there is always help just a call away. The enjoyment of this job if it is a screener position or a coordinator position is truly dependent on the hospital you are working at and how the stay works with contract people.
good,"Mednax is a national corporation managing pediatric, neonatal, perinatal, obstetric, and anesthesia groups.  Good benefits, and allows physicians to focus on medicine, not business."
good,"At my current job I enter patients demographics into our system called Medsuite from the hospital portal. I also enter patients insurance and make sure it is correct and accurate. However, if there is an issue with the insurance I either call the insurance company to work out the issues or if need be I will call the patient. Not only that, but I work realmed edits which is what rejects on our end, and I have to figure out exactly why the insurance rejected. In some cases I call to collect payments form insurance companies"
good,"The company is great to work for. Leads, trainers and managers very knowledgeable. Some staff and managers resist changes to advance us and make us better bc they have been here so long. Lots of information to learn and sometimes hard to follow. New manager is knowledgeable and helpful- strong leader. New RPAM really cares for staff, engaged with both of her teams and wants to make things better. We are short staffed to complete work but we have a good group of ladies that try."
good,"A typical day at work would include Team Lead meetings to see ways we can improve everyday functionalities. Being a Team Lead has taught me the meaning of leadership and compassion for others. We work in a fast pace world that constantly changes but we have to find a way to treat each other with respect and dignity. The workplace has a family oriented atmosphere and at times, that is the reason you get the urge to get up out of bed. The hardest part of my day is definitely miscommunication. You may be given more than one directives from multiple managers which can result in conflicts. Mednax is a great company to work for and coming to work with warm hearted people who cares about their staff and not just the work is enough for me wanting to get up and go to work everyday."
good,"Expensive Benefits, Great work life Balance, I have a great manager. I cant speak for anyone else....I have noting more to say about the company"
good,"Excellent company, I really enjoy work in this place,  but I feel I do not have the opportunity to grow on my major, excellent benefits, excellent values in the company"
good,I honestly have never worked for a better company. The only drawbacks are the pay and the system that has been put in place for absences from work.
good,"Mednax was a great place to work.  Just like every other employer, once you get used to the different personalities it is a very homey place to work.  It felt like family as they genuinely treat you as such and truly care about you as a person."
good,I had a wonderful experience at this position. It was a sad day when my position was outsourced. The people I worked with were some of the sweetest people I have ever met.
good,"Working for Mednax was a fairly positive experience for me. The hiring process took between 2-3 months so prepare yourself for that. There is a lot to learn, but once you learn it through your training you will be fine. I had this job while I was working another full-time job which worked great for me. However, this is not a job that you can have alone & fully support yourself /cover all your bills. "
good,Fast pace with always new things to learn. Great people and good benefits. Great work life balance. Easily accessible by commuters. Interesting industry.
good,love them!! u will enjoy working with such a great company and there is a lot of room for growth. You will learn a lot of great things that will help u move forward.
good,"It is a great company, but it is very political.  I like showing up to work and doing my job, this place doesnt have the environment to be successful for a long period of time."
good,"Great place to work, good benefits, fun people, flexible working hours, great location, not much room for growth, decent working pay, great place to gain knowledge"
good,"I love working for Mednax Medical Group, I work in the pediatric urgent care clinic. Everyday theirs something new to learn. I love working with kids and the atmosphere is always great!"
good,"I truly enjoyed working for this Company while I lived in Waleska, GA for two years.  I learned so much in the world of adult cardiology.  I was able to interact with patients, doctors, technicians.  I learned patient charting and dealing with insurance companies for clearance."
good,"The overall company itself was very nice! I loved the atmosphere.. You can wear jeans majority of the time.. The company do a lot of activities to make it a fun place to work.. The only thing I didn’t like was the work load and how hard they pushed productivity.. Example: you get a not worked report every Monday that’s due that same week on Friday.. You get a denial report every Monday that’s due the following Monday.. It’s impossible to complete a report when majority of your accounts you have to appeal.. Then you have returns, task, rejections, correspondence, emails, etc that you have to work also.. The workload was too much to be underpaid.. This company don’t pay nothing for the work load you have to do which is so unfair... Overall it is a great company..."
good,"Excellent place to work, Coworkers are very humble to work with. Management very knowledgeable. There is plenty of room for advancement with the company"
good,Staff is kind and focus on work.  Atmosphere is low-key and everyone tend to stay to themselves. 8-10 hours straight working at your desk. What I have learned is in this company is growing with technology and new ways of remote working.
good,I enjoyed my tenor at Pediatrix Medical Group. Just like any other company there is office drama but management was full aware of what was going on. They prefer to advance from within before hiring an outsider which is always a pro. During my time there upper management started weeding out the weak managers and toxic coworkers. As long as you provided quality work and maintain a level of professionalism you were on the good list !
good,"In February 2018, was laid off after 17 and a half years with the company, due to restructuring and job title elimination. This all occurring two days before a major surgery. I was totally in shock. I felt like the company let us down by not giving us advance notice that we were being laid off and there are jobs were being eliminated. I later discovered that quite a few of the people that were eliminated were older adults late 50s into their 60s, this was not a random choosing for a layoff. I am thankful for all the skills that I learned at Mednax, as I have discovered as I seek new employment I am now very overqualified but with a good working background and knowledge of the medical billing collections area."
good,"Mednax, great company to work for. Enjoyed my time with the company. Management is knowledgeable, great working environment, ethical and comparable salary range."
good,Busy and challenging workplace with a great team of staff and management. My overall experience has been very positive and I have always felt supported by my direct supervisor.
good,"I've been working at Mednax for about 8 months.  The management is very easy to work with, as well as my colleagues.  Everyone is very nice here.  I support 3 Director/Doctors.  My work flow is up and down.  Sometimes I'm busy and sometimes I'm not.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when I'm given a project, like a report to do, where I can format, and create.  "
good,"I do not care to share at this moment, As I stated I don not want to share any opinions on this company. everybody experiences are different. Judge for"
good,"Being able to work with newborns everyday will make you love your job more and more each day."
good,Very good company to work for and they have their own temp agency as well as use others. You will get an interview if you have the qualifying skills to do any job there!!
good,Working at Mednax give me the opportunity to learn and grow in RCM. The office director and RPAM were very great leaders that allowed the doors to be open for internal career advancement.
good,"I learned the following data-bases: IntelliCred, Master Data-Base, ICIMS, hCue, & CAQH. This training was required to understand  my job.  "
good,I normal work 4 days a week about 8-9 hours per day. I have learned a lot about high risk OB ultrasound. Management is easy to work with. The hardest part of my job is seeing anamolies. The thing I enjoy the most about my job is my patients.
good,"I love the flex time, the people I work with, an most importantly, the open door policy with everyone from my direct manager to rpam's, to directors!! Once you've worked for other corporate organizations, you'll find Mednax to be a great  organization to work for. And you'll also appreciate the perks!"
good,"You worked your region from a database so you know where to start your credentialing process, Physicians  and the HA's were very easy to work with. "
good,Fast-paced Environment.  High volume of work.  Great team work and employees with great work ethic.  Very stressful environment and not much employee recognition.
good,"Worked remotely from my home office. Had great input via Internet. Had a great supervisor, Was close to home. Had workable deadlines. Was included in various meetings"
good,"Great company to work for especially if you are a full-time college student or have another job. I have been working with Mednax over a year now part-time and they pay their employees very well. There is little room for advancement but if they had a full-time position where I am currently living at, I would never leave. Usually, I worked alone which was perfect with minimal supervision. Only con was having to work with rude nurses or CNA's that are employed by the hospital that I was working at.
