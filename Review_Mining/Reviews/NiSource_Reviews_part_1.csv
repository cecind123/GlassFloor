rating,review
bad,Do NOT WORK IN THE INTEGRATION CENTER.  I told HR that my supervisor pulled me in a meeting to accuse me of not dispatching a PR job time and they turned on me
bad,"Hectic company, no work life balance.  Good working IBM people & given contract to a third party, they mess up whole project.  No documentation.  All small age people without any experience came as managers. Often ask what is Unix, Source Control.  The managers don't know what is app server.  They hire for one & ask to work in multiple areas. No work life balance.  They call in the mid-night & ask to finish some unimportant works.  If we don't pickup, they SMS at midnight, next morning ask why didn't you finish.  I never worked in a hectic environment in my life."
bad,"Management is terrible. Ignores you when you need help however will be the first one to call you out on a mistake! Half of management has been there less than a year and has no management experience. Management should dress professional if CSRs are informed to, however some of the Team Leads dress like they crawled out of bed and some of them their clothes don't even cover their stomach."
bad,Management just throws you in the job without any guidance. Very strict managers.The wages at the job are extremely low
bad,company has poor work ethicts . Hiring contractors that dont need to be used .  spending money to line pockets of management . supervisors are puppets and have no clue how  to be  leaders . very poor communcation  to front line employees . Very talented work force but dont know how to use them . this is a company that should be looked in to .
bad,Good ole' boy firm.  Couldn't wait to get out of the firm fast enough!
bad,They make it seem like it’s this great place to work. It’s not. The Human Resources of Innosource (where you start out) does not care about its employees at all. We’re all just faces mindlessly answering phone calls to them.. not people. You’d think the worst part about the job would be getting sworn at all day and dealing with unhappy people on the phones but it’s actually the fact that you’re constantly being watched and micro managed. They even time you when you go to the bathroom?! There’s no flexibility within scheduling and they basically just make up reasons to fire you so you don’t transition to nisource. They scam you into getting on their below average health care plans. I feel like people living in Fayette County are taken advantage of working here because they offer $14.50/hr and that’s unfortunately a “higher” wage around the area. I would not recommend working here.
bad,"Unless you are related,best friends with a boss,or a female,sleeping with a boss.You will never advance,it is a back stabbing place to work,the lazier you are the faster you will advance. I watched people in the Bridgeville shop work harder getting out of work,then really doing work,the ol one n done, then go hack off the rest of the day. Oh and one more thing the bosses are nothing but rotten con people."
bad,IT mgmt team is so disorganized and so political. This company is all about favoritism and who sucks up the most. They preach ethics but it is one of the most unethical places I have ever worked for.
bad,"They pile to much work on the leads then crack the whip on the ones that are actually trying and let the ones that have been slacking off to roam freely around the building. I sent numerous reports about my issues that never got addressed, instead the situations were always turned on me and how I should handle it better, then the icing on the cake I get told I should bring my issues to my manager more often! For what reason it’s a waste of time to send an email when I send an email not only to my manager but her manager as well and no response back they  might as well tell me to go kick rocks. I don’t recommend working here because if you do tend to speak your mind or show that you are frustrated they won’t try to help solve your issues but rather move towards shoving you out the door. They tell you they are all for you and to be there for you, yeah what ever, I’ve been around people enough to be able to read them like a book don’t patronize your people listen to them and actually see why they are frustrated or take the time to talk about that email or discuss the issues they have with that employee instead of giving that fake smile and bold face lying then find ways to get rid of them."
bad,Management was very involved and did not seem to trust team members. Workers are not appreciated and feel that they are replaceable. The overall culture was negative..
bad,Since employed every position was promoted within except the one that I’m aware of. All management are too busy to truly discuss issues. Nothing ever gets rectified.
bad,"Working here was an okay job for the first year I had no problems at all. Day to day Monday through Friday like any job. However after that year past management seemed to just start pushing agents to the side and not wanting to listen to their complaints, or when they needed help. You’ll email them, email them, sametime(chat) them, and get no response sometimes you’d have to message a few of their team leads to get an answer. Can’t express your concerns when you do you’ll have the whole call center look at you like you’re a scrub. No progression here at all, you’ll sit at this desk for year after year. Trying to move up to another state(which was promises in the training) stayed “upskilling is a guarantee” WHERE?? When you’d apply for positions they pick their favorites or people who JUST started there with little to no experience about the calls coming in. Very strict on schedules can’t be more than5 mins before going on to break. So if you start your 1st break at 445 you can go at 440 or 500 pm. No later or that’ll mess up your schedule for next month. Employees you sit next to will have you wanting to pull your hair out. They talk about everyone in the call center have no remorse if you hear what they say about you. Again CANT bring up to the TLs they’ll throw shade too. Be careful walking past them in the morning at the smoke shack it’ll get real quiet real fast ..other depts don’t do their job at all expect you to do it when it’s back office work and you take billing calls. Tls will sweep everything you say under a rug, type what they want to happen and make you sign off"
bad,A terrible place to work for minorities. The pay is good but the treatment and isolation of minorities is terrible especially in meetings.
bad,"This is a safety obsessed culture. I'm all for safety, that is good. But they change things that are ridiculous/unnecessary. There, for example, is tape inbetween the microwaves because it is a 'pinch point' for your finger. (But no one ever pinched their finger.) It simply looks unprofessional. We are adults here. They force people to be upskilled into trainings/move seats/teams instead of asking for volunteers for lateral moves. Overall lack of support. Computer program you work on is very old/outdated and complex to learn/navigate.  Back to back calls with rude customers, often screaming. Stress levels are high. I've gotten tension headaches. After work you don't want to do anything. The chairs are uncomfortable. Bathroom has boogers on the wall. Cleanliness is lacking. Bathroom and break areas are often crowded. They are overly strict. The work schedule isn't flexible and there is very limited availability on the vacation calendar. You do get 3 weeks of vacation time but two weeks of it must be used as a full week at a time. Attendance is very strict after 7 sick days are up. Wasn't permitted additional time when a practice fire drill was done during lunch break and took 25 minutes. Promotions & quality scores are unfair. Required to be early/unpaid at start up. Required to stay after shift until all calls are cleared & not paid unless 8 minutes or more over. Marked down on shift bid if 30 seconds late on break or if you use FMLA. Allotted 8 minutes bathroom time daily but they're upset if you use all of it. They will throw away your food and containers if left in fridge"
bad,If you only care about making a decent wage and having good benefits this is the company for you.
bad,"Good old boys/girls environment.  Not interested in doing a good job, just advancing and building their kingdom.  Poorly managed.  Can't make decisions.  No empowerment."
bad,Reorganization does not support the current employees and new employees are often unqualified and not trained well.  One two three four five.
bad,"They treat you like garbage and no matter how hard you try they still find a lie to fire you,I worked taking over 100 calls a day and never complained while others just sat around not taking any calls!!"
bad,"Did not enjoy working there because management is not professional at all,and very disrespectful.They fire people like they are not humans.Very unprofessional the way to let a person know of being terminated."
bad,Aterrible place to work everyone micro manages you even if your good at what you do salary is 10 yrs behind times
bad,"NiSource was a great place to work and then people started to leave and the boys club was reinstated. Dispatchers get no breaks, no lunch, no bathroom breaks, no get away from your screen to stretch breaks. We are constantly forced to work 16hrs a day for multiple days on a weekly basis. Pay-rate continues to slip as work loads continue to get heavier. Management is clueless and blames everyone but themselves for their shortcomings"
bad,"management is just all over the place, no one really have any ideal of what does something, Or who goes to a certain site or location, not really a fun place to work."
bad,Sitting behind a desk and assisting people with their gas bill and asking them on how we can assist them with lowering their bills and providing them with the best information we know about their bills.
bad,I don't think this company is even around any more.  I have nothing bad to say about this company.
bad,"Great health care with dental vision optional. 20 vacation days with 7 sick days - all paid. Short term disability of 480 hours if needed. Job is very stressful as when a customer's gas is shut off for nonpayment, you have to put up with abusive language."
bad,"If you’re a political player, you’ll do well here, make lots of money, and you won’t have any true responsibility. Just come in, attend meetings, and collect the money! However, if you have integrity, and want to make a difference, keep going. Run, don’t walk, RUN from NiSource. Lots of games, micromanaging, disrespect, unprofessional environment. "
bad,"This job has amazing benefits and pay, however the environment and people you are surrounded by will negatively impact your overall health and life.. ..."
bad,NiSource does not provide good support to groom and mentor employees to advance their careers. Very limited career mobility prospects.
bad,"I worked here as a temp and my assignment ended earlier this year. I couldn't wait to be done. I hear the benefits are good and pay is decent but the management is horrible. Nasty attitudes, they talk to you like you're nothing. Even the CSRs are terribly rude to the customers. I've never seen that type of behavior accepted at any other call center I've worked at but no one gets in trouble for it. Everyone is miserable here. It's true what they say, money isn't everything"
bad,The employees here usually leave as quickly as they get hired. The company doesn’t value the fact that their employees have families and lives outside of their workplace.
bad,"Contract position. Great team, set up meetings and new hire paperwork. Limited interaction with supervisor and team members. Day to day responsibilities varied."
bad,"It is an okay job , I really don't have much to say about the company . The management is okay and the co-workers are great ! A normal work day is something you usually get but they are very strict on their regulations."
bad,"Out of Business, acquired by Trianna Energy This is why I started ARK Energy. With the back ground in measurement, well production, well evaluation and supervision, along with my drilling and fracing experience gave me the foundation to start the business."
good,Not really a fan of this place. No job security at all. Hired on as contract employee. A month later they hired a crop of people on directly and never gave me a chance. was let go the following week even though I was told I was doing well.
good,"One of the worst jobs I’ve had. They trick you in training making you feel like the company is a family. The pay was the only good thing. You would think since we are being abused by the customers on the daily that our management would be some relief, but that’s FALSE. My team lead didn’t care one bit about her agents. She was like an emotionless blob. Couldn’t even make a joke around her. Also you get quality scores and it’s like trying to get a 100 on your SATs. Run away and don’t look back."
good,"If you were with the In-Crowd back in the day, you'll be fine.  If you were on the fringes, get used to being alone. And just filling in some more characters to hit minimum."
good,"NiSource is both a great place to work and a horrible place. If you have a manager that you can work with it's beyond wonderful. If your manager is a jerk, and there are a lot of those, good luck.  And since the management turns over a fair amount you are going to experience both.  If you are at corp HQ in Indiana its a right to work state and you can get a HUGE bonus one day and be gone a week later because you got a new manager who doesn't like your style.  I worked with groups who were collaborative and shared everything that got a new manager and suddenly it was heads down and mouth shut, do your work and go home.  Then he retired and it was back to collaboration."
good,The setting itself wasn't bad the people that they have promoted without actually speaking with is where I didn't agree. Most of the supervisors didn't care for your question and always ignored people needing help to finish their conversation about the last time they went out.
good,"Too many Chiefs and not enough Indians.  Management was either in meetings constantly or were walking around.  "
good,Not a lot of room for growth. Seems when jobs are posted the hiring manager already knows who will fill the position.  If you are not good at behavior questions you will not get a promotion.
good,"Management is sporadic.  Some team leaders are fantastic while others have a horrible attitude and don't care if you succeed at all.  If placed with a great leader, the mundane aspects of answering phones all day is tolerable.  If not, run!"
good,"I do not have a review at this time. I have not left employment there and I am still unsure that I want to leave. Its not the worst place to work, but id like to see if I would be happier elsewhere."
good,"Great salary and benefits and a lot of opportunities.  However, if you are a female, expect to be held down by the upper management boys club.  While they are out golfing and lunching, you will do their grunt work.  Sadly, management issues can make long standing, hard working, good employees leave their careers for other opportunities."
good,"The company is experiencing growing pains after cleaving off their natural gas exploration and pipeline group.  There are many projects that are started, and then abandoned.  There are many programs that are rolled out, only to be moth-balled or forgotten about.  This leads to a very tumultuous environment where employees simply go in, do their work and go home.  Low- and mid-level management is often caught flatfooted with sudden changes from the higher ups and, thus, not fully prepared to discuss the purpose or vision behind the change.  While the coworkers are great and the facilities and benefits are top notch, the lack of direction and constant reshuffling leaves much to be desired."
good,"I have been with the company awhile, and seem to find the same issues in every department.  There are senior employees that are dissatisfied because they are being passed up on opportunities.  Only certain people get promoted over and over.  The level of diversity in the higher level jobs is obsolete.  What happened to working hard, and being given a fair opportunity?"
good,"Decent salaries provided"
good,"a typical day can either be good or stressful, answering calls and handling different protocols for 4 different states is stressful, even if the customer calls in and is already angry"
good,Management has since changed since I was last there and I’m unable to give an accurate description of what the day to day office culture is. I no longer keep in touch with anyone there.
good,"The department I worked for wasn't the best, but that was due to poor management. The company as a whole is a decent place and strives for a family-like culture"
good,Decent money and can change jobs to learn new skills due to the bidding process. Emphasizes on safety for the most part. Union shop and its very old school union.
good,"What should have been a simple customer service position with good pay became a stressful race to hit all top quotas or constantly be belittled and harrassed. I felt less like an employee and more like a seat filler under scrutiny to make every call perfect for both customer and company (as if that's within the realm of possibility most calls) or suffer constant threat of termination/pay advancement loss if not perfect. I steadily advanced under old management with high praise for my abilities that stopped and changed to criticism by the same individuals under new management. I watched seasoned agents (10+years) suddenly unable to meet QA scores following the EXACT same rules/guidelines they have for years. "
good,"Overall good place to work, good benefits. The company communicates well with employees on what is going on at a high level. Need to remodel some of very old offices but people are nice."
good,Loved my daily meetings and job tasks of supporting engineering managers.  I learned a great deal about many different softwares and about management. My managers were fantastic to work for as were my co-workers to work with.  I overall enjoyed my employment there.
good,Great place to work to learn new technologies. Can be stressful at times as there is poor project management and poor planning.  Can go weeks without seeing or hearing from management.
good,Management was okay. Company slow growth but stable it is utility. Positive work environment. Had a lot of senior (long-timers). Relaxed environment. Staffed properly where you have great work/life balance and flexible schedules.
good,"The compensation and benefits provided are excellent, as are the employees who work there. The workplace culture is improving; however, constant reorganizations are stifling and sometimes, counterproductive."
good,A typical day at work would be working on computer with various software.
good,"It was a great experience getting to grow, my leader was wonderful, team building and encouraging, a great place to start working as an engineer with great benefits, new engineers are pushed to get a PE license."
good,"I enjoy the work I do at NiSource and the teams I have worked with very much however, being that the company is split between Merrillville and Columbus this has caused a fear of job security. We also have had a lot of change in management. As such, we have gone through an org change at least once a year since I started at the company. More and more jobs keep moving to Ohio."
good,"I really loved the people I worked with, and at one point had an outstanding manager that I learned a great deal from.  NiSource is busy with a number of large investments, so there is never a shortage of work!"
good,Learned few standard good practices. Good team and Manager. Got a chance to manage huge team with multi vendors. overall Very good experience and happy.
good,"Can you imagine being served a free, delicious buffet lunch Monday through Thursday? What an awesome touch, one that promotes personal well-being (stopping for lunch) and greater collaboration (chatting with co-workers you might not otherwise see that day). Modern, comfortable offices. Extreme customer focus. Overall great place to work."
good,NiSource has been through a number of reorganizations and downsizing. Seems like he worst is over and they are focused on growing the business.Overall a good place to work
good,"Was fun adapting to an extremely fast paced environment and being able to see ideas turn into reality!"
good,"NISource is an excellent company and employer with an aggressive outlook on the natural gas transmission industry. Being a multi state company, there is ample room for growth."
good,"The company was fair with starting wages and gave consideration for vacation time by including time served in other companies as guideline to my starting vacation tenure.  I did not have to start over. "
good,NiSource does well by its employees.  They look at opportunities for advancement unfairly though.  I think overall nisource is a great place to work though.
good,"The Human Resource Department was fast-paced and demanding but it was extremely rewarding. Recruiting afforded me the opportunity to be a part of 'win-win"" situations (satisfying the needs of the organization while helping applicants to realize their career goals).  I took pride in being a Corporate ambassador and working effectively at all levels within the organization."
good,"I spent over 20 years working here. Culture was friendly, open, and collaborative.  They are currently downsizing and morale is currently down. Management tends to be unstable and is reorganizes constantly."
good,Pay was good co workers were good.  Upper mgmt wasn’t really the nterested in working with us to accomplish goals. When hired in was supposed to get paid holidays after starting was told we didn’t get them.  Left because upon hiring I told them certain things I couldn’t do for legal reasons they tried to force me to.
good,Fast paced and stressful at times but was a great place to work. Benefits were very good for myself and my family. I would suggest this company to a friend.
good,"A quiet, somewhat sleepy place to work. Busy during cold winters, slow elsewise. Not cutthroat, but little opportunity to advance. People with good jobs tend to stay with them for years and years. Decent benefits and pay, but less than you might make in other sectors."
good,"NiSource offers very competitive salaries and benefits.  In corporate finance you are expected to manage your daily work and ensure you meet deadlines.  There is overtime at month, quarter, and year end.  NiSource is very generous to its employees offering catered lunches and monetary awards for a job well done."
good,Mostly positive work environment with some flexibility and competitive pay and benefits.
good,"Answer inbound calls in regards to gas and electric. Handle emergency calls about gas leaks, outages, hit lines, and etc. The call center was an ok atmosphere, you had a lot of people that didn't like their job because management would pick on them. The job was not hard you just had some customers that were rude and unpleasant."
good,"Decent place to work. The pay is phenomenal. They include their contract employees in outside group activities. If they like you, they like you. Nice place to work. Very smart group of individuals."
good,"I have worked for several fortune 100 companies and NiSource is one of the best work environments that I have ever worked in,  I would have loved to stay but I was on contract and let go because of budget concerns."
good,"The company is great, this is like a small family company within a big business. Extremely busy during 4 months a year in the New Business department if you can make it though those months you will be fine."
good,Great company to work for learned a lot involving the gas industry. Different situations and scenarios bring about different thought processes which involve critical thinking which has helped me develop my decision making. NiSource also implements and consistently preaches safety and also providing inclusion and diversity throughout the entire company.
good,NiSource is a great company to work for.  You have a good work to personal life.  Not to many days of working over a typical eight hour day.  Management for the most part has a great understanding of the company and see where the company is trying to go in the future.
good,"The CSR role for Nisource consists of taking customer service and "
good,"Negotiate contracts, review inventory levels, work on cost savings projects, approve invoices. Help drive value through strategic sourcing and manage supplier relationship process."
good,"Excellent management, safe working environment.Excellent salary, benefits and working environment. NiSource is a firm believer in inclusion and diversity."
good,NIPSCO  is a good place to work and it is very fast paced. Lots of customer experience and engineering opportunities. Training for new hires needs to be approved but immediate managers care about employees.
good,"I have enjoyed my employment at NiSource. They provided me my first job out of college, and I've loved every minute that I've been here."
good,productive but great place to start off a career. very friendly people and work environment. however there can always be improvements.
good,"Even though I was a short term contract, the employees were helpful and friendly."
good,Can be chaotic. People are friendly enjoyable place to work. Training is abundant. Management listens for the most part. Good place to work still holds some of the old school utility mentality
good,"slow and steady. Enjoyable people, enjoyable projects. was able to work with innovative technology and software. worked with great consultants and built a network in the field that allowed me to branch out."
good,There are several employee resource groups to help advance inclusion and diversity.    They provide events and support from all levels of the company.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. The compensation and benefits are good.  There is lack of advancement.  Some managers need a little more training.
good,"Excellent work environment.  Valued work life balance,  Provided good benefits and pay.  Provided ample learning and advancement opportunities, Fast passed and team oriented environment."
good,"Up to date tools and good place to learn as much as you can,"
good,"A typical day - work from the office or travel to remote locations"
good,working there was great handled calls for Columbia gas and handled accounts and shut off notices and opening accounts as well and also making payments
good,Energy USA is a small part of nisource. The people I worked with were nice and friendly and knew what they were doing. They were whiling to mentor you and wanted you to succeed at your position.
good,This was a really great place to work.  I was brought in on a contract to higher.  Project was going good until one of the full timers refused to hand off a key project to me.  When I confronted the person in their office I noticed they had 1200 unread emails.  A week later I was let go.  Months later that person was promoted to Director.  I guess it pays to keep things close to the vest?  But everything else was awesome there.  Very positive impression of the organization.  I just wish I would have exposed this person sooner.  My assignment only lasted 5 months.  CIO was super!!!!
good,"Good company. Strong leadership in general.  Most of the company leadership in Columbus, Ohio."
good,"I had a great experience as an engineering intern for the company. I learned a lot about real world engineering, it is not like what we are taught in classes. Manager was great, gave me plenty of opportunities to learn and grow."
good,"Can be a fun place to work. Busy seasons like any place."
good,"Great all the way around! Great benefits, environment, management care about you. The hours are great and flexible for the most part and lots of OT is available if you want it!"
good,"a typical day of work  is to provide Project Management and technical expertise for designing, estimating, constructing, operating and maintaining Gas Transmission and Distribution pipelines, measurement, regulation and related equipment. Also Provide effective project management resources that employ practical, proven project management methodology, tools & techniques and implement new projects on-time and in a successful manner."
good,I had a great experience at NiSource. The people are smart and hard-working. We had a lot of success and they provided me with opportunities for advancement and learning new skills. They recently increased their focus on training as well as inclusion and diversity.
good,"I learned a lot about finance and accounting, as well as cash management in my 4 years working there."
good,NiSource is people oriented from the top down.  Safety of the employees and the public is a number one priority as well as serving the customer to the fullest of our ability.  Most managers do a good job and believe in developing their people.
good,"Provides enough training to perform functions of job, with sufficient up-training and info on new developments, can be stressful due to nature of calls, but also gives ability to help people in need.  Strict absentee policy in training, but understandably.  Good pay, good benefits."
good,I feel blessed to have gotten in to NiSource. It is a great fortune 500 company with great benefits and a management team that supports there staff. Plenty of room for advancement and an over all great culture. I wish more companies were like them.
good,"Every day is a little different with this particular company. One day can be filling out paper work, and the next you can be out in the field getting a feel for the projects you work on. The work environment is relaxed, but everyone still accomplishes all of their assigned duties in timely fashion. Very accepting of new people and new ideas."
good,"Great company, great people, love the fact that management encourages education and growth."
good,Great atmosphere and learning experience. Opportunity for growth and self motivation is truly impeccable. Management is reachable and available for work and personal issues.
good,"I strongly believe that in addition to my EH&S experience and knowledge, NiSource supported the systems to maintain a safe and healthy work place,"
good,Great working environment. Management is very helpful and willing to help you succeed. People are very friendly and respectful. Great culture and working environment
good,They care about your well being outside of work.  The company supports continuous education and wants to make you a better employee.  There is a lot of longevity with employees.
good,"I would recommend NiSource as a fair company to work for and they are good at promoting their people and making an investment in their futures. Good culture, good management, good people."
good,"admin assistant to buyers in procurement dept, "
good,Most employees are driven to perform at a high level.  People are friendly and dependable and management is focused on inclusion.  Opinions are generally valued.
good,"Great company to work with. Awesome benefits, job security, management is very smart but sometimes suppressive, it depends on the department that you are in. Seasoned employees who are always willing to teach and share."
good,good work ambience and day to day wok is good and professional. Job has good work place culture. Management is friendly and cooperative. Learning experience is good.
good,"I would just say that everything was good over there. I was in need of a career advancement kind of job, which would be enhancing my skills more, and I would get a chance to explore my skills more."
good,"Enjoyed working there, made many friends.  Attorneys were very nice and I learned allot from them.  Company down-sized and our positions were eliminated."
good,"Good company to work for overall."
good,"The people make it an amazing place to work. Everyone is incredibly brilliant and eager to help each other out. I learned tons and had the opportunities to branch off into other projects as I wanted to. The hardest part of the job is all the meetings; the environment promotes loads of communication, which is great, but the amount of meetings really stacks up. Overall, fantastic place to work, great compensation,  great people."
good,Great place to work  - I have no regrets - Had to relocate to florida so I don't have much to say about the job but really like working for the company.  Great people culture and vision.
good,"The typical day was back to back calls. resolve issues, explain bills, provide information to customer in regards to the help available, no day was the same as far as the calls were concerned. placed orders, requested adjustments if needed."
good,Good atmosphere and cool place.Good job and good compensation and good benefits and good security and good advancement and good management and good job culture.
good,"I have enjoyed working for Nisource.  I have to relocate due to a change in husbands job location."
good,Excellent opportunity to acquire new technical skills. Management pretty much allowed staff to work independent of direct supervision.
good,"My manager at this position was fantastic. He cares about advancing his employees through the company and takes pride in his employees wowing the higher ups. If the pay wasn't so much greater with my promotion, I would have been happy doing this work for many more years to come. If I had the chance to go back to this company location/department for the pay I'm making now, I would in a heartbeat."
good,The company views their employees the same as their customers. They value them and understand life happens no matter who you are. There are plenty of development and advancement opportunities if you wish to pursue them. Tons of volunteer work available.
good,"NiSource is a great place to work, people are dedicated, management is very focused.  We successfully completed this project thanks to a very well managed consulting team & NiSource resources."
good,"I would definitely go back to work for this company This is an excellent company to work , I worked with a great group of engineers that would support you on your project anytime you need help ."
good,"It can be fun to work here, but also stressful. I like all the employees and tl’s.   The stressful part is dealing with everyday customers who just had a bad day or just want to be mean.   Other than that I’m the spring time it’s not really that busy, so you have a lot of down time to catch up on other things.   Pay is good, benefits and pto is amazing."
good,NiSource afforded all the team members a chance to showcase skillsets and ability. They had a wonderful take ownership mentality that encouraged employees to work independently. Great Organizati
good,Wonderful place to work. Only left because the company moved out of the area. Provided great working conditions and room for advancement. It was a great career path and I would recommend it anyone looking for a career.
good,Wages are excellent and the job is fairly easy! Benefits are great and your schedule is flexible. You can work a part time shift and still get paid great. Very friendly environment and professional. Merriville campus is in a great location and the building is very well kept. Nipsco is definitely known to be one of the best companies to work for in Northwest Indiana! This is a career oriented place that you can retire from!
good,This was my first accounting job out of college and I learned a great deal about accounting at NiSource.  Management was fantastic and great to work with.
good,management was fabulous- team lead exceptional and helpful- not micro manged hands on- great training- beautiful office- great group of people - only left relocated to Georgia
