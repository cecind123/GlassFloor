good,"At Chase, i'm always learning new things everyday and everyone there is always thriving for greatness. I feel really good about working at Chase because my co-workers and management are friendly and good at what they do."
good,"The most important difference between JPMorgan and other investment banks is that they managed to merge commercial banking and investment banking in a way that made sense.  Other companies either failed to do this (Citigroup) or didn't try (Goldman-Sachs and Morgan-Stanley).  This meant that you had cultural influences of commercial banking, such as focus on risk, big infrastructure systems, moderation of the ""get rich quick"" mentality, and a heavily emphasis on process.  JPMorgan is also much larger than GS and Morgan-Stanley, which meant more process and more bureaucracy.  This can be a bad thing, but when it works, it can be a good thing."
good,"good place to work"

I readily assisted my colleague during the project and did as he suggested. Even though simpler tasks like making a presentation or reviewing reports were menial tests that I used to assign to junior consultants in past engagements, I was doing these activities on this engagement. There were several things that I learned from this experience. I learned that it is alright to give charge and authority to another professional who has better skills for the engagement at hand. I also realized that even though I was the face for this client, it was alright for me to allow my colleague to take the lead in client presentation. At the end of the day, it was the team work and a better understanding between both of us that resulted in a successful engagement.

good,"i bounced between a couple different branches in my short tenure (10 months) so i saw a good variety of environments. If you apply for a part time 20 hour position in an area with a lot of chase branches you will have lots of chances to pick up shifts. you will be spending a great deal of the day killing time. i suggest having a more upbeat or ""bright"" personality. chase is big on being friendly and talking to the customers. there is a bit of pressure for opening accounts and referring customers to bankers but they try to make it light hearted as not to scare you. I was lucky and had great managers (3 different branch and assistant managers). It also seemed fairly easy to move up. If you are in a ""chase heavy city"" there will be lots of open positions and training to move around. the longer you are there the more you can shape your schedule to your liking (i knew a couple of people that had been there 20 something years and had the schedule locked down tight to their liking). if you have a short fuse i don't recommend it. being able to work and keep up small talk with customers will help you alot."

good,"My most recent position at JP Morgan Chase was both challenging and rewarding. I worked in the Loss Mitigation Department helping distressed homeowner's to prevent foreclosure. My workday consisted of processing a large number of mortgage modification applications which required me to determine a client's income and personal net-worth. The idea was to determine if they could afford their mortgage or if they would be able to afford it at a reduced payment. I had to analyze profit and loss statements, bank statements (personal and business), investment statements (401k, IRA, CD, Stocks and Bonds, Mutual Funds), tax returns (personal and business) and pay stubs. My job was to break down their income on a monthly basis and compare it to their monthly debts including mortgages, auto loans, personal loans, credit cards, household bills, etc. I had to assess the risk on behalf of the bank and determine if it was cost-worthy to modify the existing terms of a client's mortgage or determine if the simply couldn't afford the loan. The role required paying attention to every detail, scrutinizing every transaction and presenting any red flags to our Fraud/Anti-Money Laundering Department. It was a fast-paced, high stress work environment with daily, weekly and monthly deadlines. In this position, I learned more about statistical analysis, market research and financial analysis. I also learned more about the consumer mortgage business and how to assess the risk of multi-million dollar portfolios on behalf of the bank.  The management structure was encouraging, helpful and accommodating. In"

The management staff was well trained which made it 100% better for the employers to feel confident and feel encouraged with wanting to work for this company. Which to me makes a big deal, because without a solid and enriching work environment it makes employers unenthused about their work which means the quality is valuable at all."
