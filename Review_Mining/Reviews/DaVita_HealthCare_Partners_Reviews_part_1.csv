good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,It is a  Horrible  Company to work for  The employees are favored  Depending on how long you been there the manager is a liar and unreliable they are underpaid and overworked they do not care about there patients
bad,"Poor unprofessional management and staff.  Loud, gum chomping, inappropriate conversations,  eating, drinking during work hours employees.  I can’t believe a business allows it.  Don’t work here  don’t send your loved ones here."
bad,"Poor leadership.  They state they are Community first company --- this is not true.  The leadership sacrifices teammates to save themselves.  There is constant turnover with this company, especially with Registered Nurses."
bad,"Management will do anything and everything to cover up any bad behavior, faults or poor treatment of patients for their favorite nurses or techs. If you go above your sups you will be let go."
bad,"After working for this company for quite s few years, I’m very disappointed in the way things have gone. Terrible management and money hungry. They are a for profit company and it shows! They’re in for a rude awakening with this new legislation and it’s just a matter of time before the union bill passes!"
bad,"The company is great, and what they stand for is amazing. However, the staff they hire is questionable. The facility administrators are only there for the check. Not the wellness of a patient. The techs are what make the place decent."
bad,Company does not show concern with laws or rules and regulations concerning nursing. When rules and regulations are shown to the company they have no concern. The protection of a nurse's license is not a priority.
bad,"As a nurse, the professionalism is nonexistent here at Gainesville-Jesse Jewell location.  They do not practice  what they preach in advertising and condone bullying and lies.  Upper mgmt. does not listen and FA's blow each other to make the wheel go around.  Total chaos within.  If you commit to working here you have just wasted your time to be let down when their true colors surface and you realize you have set yourself up for failure with this place.  Staff spend most of their time outside smoking - Davita pays half of their weekly paycheck to these employees to go outside and smoke and don't even know it - that's how involved they are!  DA's."
bad,"Management is not willing to work with you or help you grow within company. High amount of favoritism. If you arent friends already with your FA, you will get the worst shifts and barely get your 1 or 2% raise."
bad,"Episódios constantes de assédio moral, favoritismo, preconceito. São grosseiros, perseguem os funcionários. Empresa com péssimo clima, diretoria de RH e a principal promotora de assédio moral."
bad,"I found that working for DaVita, unless you were sucking up to everyone above you, guzzling the Kool-Aid AND were able to backstab your coworkers you weren't going to get far.  The potential for growth and advancement was laughable if it weren't non-existent.  "
bad,"Pay is not good, boss is not there or with u. Benefits arent good, "
bad,Not the same company I once worked for. They are only concerned with staffing and will use anyone with a pulse and rn license but is dangerous. If you are lpn and lower you dont matter
bad,Salary is awful for an LPN.  LPN is treated.like a aide there.  You learn no skills there as a LPN to be able to advance.  The wrong place for an LPN.
bad,"Great as a start to dialysis, for the training and certification, but leave quickly they’re a bunch of con artist and liars. Hired a Bunch of Nurses who were coked up and if you seemed to look like you were going to report them you were out."
bad,Management is absolutely the WORST. Extremely Understaffed. Expected to work long hours with no breaks. Everyone is for the selfs there is NO TEAM WORK. Patients even confirmed they dislike employees and management but have no other option but to get treated there. Management doesn’t care for employees nor patients. Always out of supplies and forced to treat patients without supplies to perform job safely.
bad,Working with patients everyday is the best part. Saving lifes is the best part of the job. Knowing you are making a difference. Making them get better everyday.
bad,Horrible place to work. Patients are allowed to treat you like dirt. The FA will straight lie to your face. Made me never want to work with patients ever again. Made to feel awful if too sick to work or slow bc of sickness. Just overall a bad experience.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"The Philippino community has taken over DaVita & are VERY competitive, manipulative, & possessive of their territory.  This makes it difficult getting your hours & the Scheduler doesn’t have a clue where the RNs live & can work!  They will send them somewhere that is an hour drive, & send another RN to a place just down the street from the first RN!!!  They don’t look at addresses to pair the RN with the closest hospital to them!!!"
bad,"It's a good entry level job to get a foot in the door for healthcare. However, seeing the greed from a money hungry healthcare company can kill your passion for taking care of sick people. Use as a resume builder, not a career."
bad,Please don’t waste your time with working for this company. They expect you to know all kinds of things that has nothing to do with your job. For instance a nurse and a pct job is totally different positions on the floor. Tell me why I was stuck in a class full of nurses and was force feed the medical terminology and all.mind you we  as pct does not use this in charting or anywhere.  I thought I had taken a nurse course. They do not set you up for success and they don’t have good training
bad,Horrible place to work at Would not advise anyone work there   Incompetent management especially in IT....Nanny state type of management  they treat people like babies
bad,"The culture is the exact opposite of their missions statement. They have what are called “core values”, two of them being integrity and teamwork. BOTH of which are lacking in the clinic. I’ve worked with nurses who take the shortcut because several of them are lazy, instead of considering what’s best for the patient. The nurses show favoritism and treat the technicians like slaves. They sit in the nurses station and go on their phones, yet if they see a tech sitting, they make them do something. Most techs only exercise teamwork if you help them in return. This is because the culture at DaVita is so negative & polluted, that even the good techs that usually enjoy helping everyone, get burned out. So eventually, they have to stop helping others because if you are this type of person, which I was, YOU WILL BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. "
bad,"I rate them 0 zero stars. I would rate them 1 for insurance but that sucks too. They charge you  $30 a month for you and each member of your family that does for not going to see a physician. If i don't have enough money to pay my bills, I don't have money to pay unnecessary co-pays for me and my family."
bad,"Horrible place to work,management horrific and PCT's disrespectful and it is an atmosphere of backstabbing and mistrust.Management can't be trusted with anything and don't care about their staff and are only concerned with having enough staff to get thru the day.It doesn't matter if staff is ill, they are asked to ""suck it up and get back to work"".Absolutely dreadful place to work and I truly feel sorry for anyone in renal failure and has the sad misfortune of having to go to Davita for their treatment.Pay is a complete joke!!"
bad,"Awful. The FA is by far the root of the problem at this facility. Everyone is miserable. Awful, hostile work environment. Steer clear of this particular clinic."
bad,"Worked 16-18 hour days, 5 days a week  Never had time to spend with my family. Worked in 2 acute inpatient units, not enough staff. Not enough orientation"
bad,"Its not a good place for your mental health. they dont care about their employees. we had a great boss, but she had to step down because she needed more time for herself and i am in a similar situation. Davita will suck the life out of you until there is nothing left. dont work here."
bad,"This company is over rated, horrible management, racially imbalanced, did not pay based on 14+ years of experience, and very u organized, and lack technology in medicine by at least a decade."
bad,"The bad definitely outweighed the good. Horrible place to work. Never enough staff, 1 RN to 40 patients..not safe at all. Poor management, all employees were family. HATED IT."
bad,Poor management backstabbing employees does not work as team players management easily criticizes but doesn't know what the  the nurses are doing short staff and the company overall stocks I do not recommend
bad,This company is obviously money first and everything else comes after. They preach a good game but don’t live up to it. Under paid over worked in every position. This company is a stepping stone at best.
bad,Horrible management & very low pay for senior level employees. Micromanaged & unfriendly staff. Toxic & stressful environment and not appreciated for what you do.
bad,"Workload unmanageable. No patient to RN ratios."
bad,Unprofessional management. No nurses just “over trained exhausted techs”. Zero work to homelife balance and i traveled to other clinics often (this was never discussed during my interview).
bad,"They allow employees to be bullied by people in positions of authority. Disciplinary actions poor, and employee not really allowed to have a say in. I had a horrible experience."
bad,"Work for more than 13yrs never felt value as an employee"
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,What they sell you when you interview and what you experience as an employee are two very different things. There’s too much favoritism and very clicky.
bad,Some time you get hours sometimes you don't company really doesn't care about you. If you facility administrator is unprofessional the whole clinic suffers techs and nurses have the worst positions. And are treated the worst most FA are in the clinic once a week but are supposesd to be maintaining the clinic. I wish i would have accepted a job elsewhere.
bad,"They treat their employees very unfairly, I was harassed by patients, it was unorganized, unsafe work environment, they were short staff so they just placed me on the floor to work entire mods by myself. When brought to HR's attention they did absolutely nothing. The nurse was beyond rude. They did not give their $1.00 raise after completing training as promised."
bad,Worse company ever to work for. Very inconsistent and management allows the lowest on the pole to run the facilities aka PCTs. The turnover says alot.
bad,"I would never work for this co. Knowing that EVERYDAY, except Sunday, I went to work with hateful ppl that put themselves and profit above lives. The Hippocratic Oath is to due no harm to the patient. This co. does not do that BC of the Fresenius Co. competition and heartlessness."
bad,"Get there at 4:45 a.m. work your butt off for 12 hours making 12.5 hourly. I make twice as much hourly selling insurance from 9-5. Nurses barely move,  making 40 an hour. It's hard work and anything can happen. I've dealt with so much loss in the 8 months I worked there it takes its toll. Good luck"
bad,"Would not recommend for LPN’s no definely not a good position for LPN TOO MUCH WORK FOR NOT ENOUGH MONEY AND NIT ENOUGH TEAM PLAYING , At least at the Akron City Hospital Location."
bad,"DaVita doesn't care patients or ""teammates"" all they care about is MONEY!!! 'D"" stands for devil! The have a culture that encourages bullies! The good nurses and techs leave and the bad stay and are rewarded. The federal government needs to do a undercover investigation of this company! Not just on how workers are treated but how patients are treated...infection rates, infiltrations, lost accesses due to a VERY POOR training program."
bad,Management will push or fire u with made up reasons to get you out. I’ve seen it happen to many people. Was there for 7 mos and approx 10 people had quit or were fired. They only care about themselves. My manager and supervisor went to another dept bc they were afraid of being fired.  Low survey from employees
bad,I was told that I was a part time employee when they had me work full time hours.  I was pregnant and they had me working very strenuous  jobs fpr 13 hour shifts.  They wouldn't tell me the hours I would be working until the week of.  It just wasn't a good fit for me.
bad,"Poor training "
bad,"RUN, RUN, RUN....AND FAST. This company doesn't care about the patients just how much money they can make. I  had my pod partner reprogram one of my patients machine to make them sick so I could get in trouble. She still works there go figure that one out."
bad,"Treated like slaves, the marion oh manager treated employees with no recpect or common courtesy. You were just a number with no value. Always threatened if even the smallest thing was wrong. Then called a liar when an explanation was given that wasn't your fault."
bad,"Transferred from another state to the location in Lithia Springs, manager Stephanie was very unprofessional, would order lunch for the entire team except me. She never ordered me. A name tag or my scrubs my Trainer was worse rude and condescending"
bad,"Poor management, Competition between teammates, always short staff, definitely would not recommend, stressful 95% of the time. If they know you're good at tasks they will have you doing everything little no to help plus the technician job which you were actually hired for, they do not give you more pay or a decent raise. Big bosses always come in saying how they are making changes and nothing ever gets changed."
bad,"Management was poor not experienced and rude to their staff. The only care for the managers were their quarterly bonuses. Also, many managers and coordinators would hire family members for positions they were not qualified for over other staff.  There was also A LOT OF FAVORITISM."
bad,"This place was the worst place i have ever worked.  They are NOT out to take care of their patients, they are out to make their new clinic numbers look good.  The 2 nurses that I worked with there were the worst.  I resigned because their theory there was WE TAKE CARE OF THE PATIENTS, WE DONT CALL 911 IF NEEDED.   I can think of 3 patients that I personally called 911 for them and it not they wouldnt have made it."
bad,Bad software team. I would not recommend applying here to anyone.  It is not worth the time and effort.  Their system is not well thought out and there are too many problems.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,Upper level so out of touch you might think it’s the government!  Front line folks work so hard and are paid so little. It’s apparent upper level bonuses are based on labor productivity
bad,A typical day at work consists of setting up dialysis machine and monitoring patient during their treatment time. The most enjoyable part of the job is building the relationship with your patients.  Patient become family because you see each other three times a week for several hours and they develop a special bond with you and share their life with you. The workplace culture can be different from facility to facility but for the most part everyone is a team player and every teammate has the same goal to treat our patient in a kind and safe way and we try our best as a team to make their situation a little easier every treatment.
bad,"Extremely understaffed"
bad,"Management was absolutely horrible, dishonest and manipulating. She treated patients and staff like we were just numbers. Visiting staff were always showed more appreciation than home staff."
bad,"Slow to no advancement or appreciation for internal employees, instead constistently hiring external candidates who are friends of managers & directors, with no regard to any standard or transparent interview process.  Overt favoritism and double standards for performance expectations and project assignments.  Even when the powers that be are made aware that morale is in the tank due to these issues, nothing changes and usually those expressing concern experience negative repercussions.  "
bad,"Horrible management and they let the PCT’s override doctors orders and challenge target weights in the dialysis clinic. When the RN says something, the PCT’s will gang up on you and complain to management that they are being picked on... what a crock!!!"
bad,"Hated this job so much! Director is disrespectful. No experience.. made so many changes , screwed everything up then went out on leave. Job is a nightmare. Never worked somewhere where there was so much turnover. Everyone leaves & quits this place."
bad,This was a horrible company to work for. Mission statement not flowed. Mangers write you up for mistakes they made. Not a favorable place if you have a family.
bad,"Our location was awful. we went through 3 administrators in a year."
bad,"They will lie straight to your face, and disrespect your test timing!! Horrible decision for someone who is in training! Plus they don't go by the book with breaks and lunches but they go by the book to fire you. I suggest while in training RECORD EVERY CONVERSATION! They will pull factual conclusions over your head."
bad,"Was unhappy with the work environment, the teammates were not actually playing for the same team. There is a lot of clicks, almost felt like being in High School."
bad,Management discriminatory against older employees.Worst job I've ever had in my lifetime and I've been in the field over 40 years.  A typical day is being bullied by management. I learned never stay longer at a job that you hate just because you think things will change. Workplace culture was unbearable. The hardest part of the job was being belittled and abused all day long. There was no enjoyable part of the job. Overtime was mandatory. I couldn't wait to get out of there at the end of the day. I was stressed out and ill.
bad,"When offering fun ideas and extra curricular activities, not open to suggestions. Uncomfortable to speak to management. Mostly standoffish and unapproachable."
bad,"All that you see in papers and magazine is nothing compare to the truth and reality of what goes on in each facility. Management are corrupt with the ideas of numbers and shortcuts with no intentions of living the so called ""core values"". Patient care has gone down the drain, short staff causing over load of work for the ones who's loyal and desperate for their income. The morale of the company and the deceit that goes on reaching millions for KT, VP and all management who has no idea where the BUCK starts. Never once picked up a day to work the floor yet continue to enforced P&P that are impossible to meet. Hours are getting cut yet  more work to be expected even outside the scope of practice. Director and Doctors complaint of cheap labor and care. Do not recommend for any one to get burnt and hate ever doing patient care!!!"
bad,"Senior leadership is awful. This company DOES NOT care about patients, only money. They have unrealistic expectations for the resources provided, and only provide adequate support when your facility gets a visit from a State Surveyor. If you file a complaint or grievance, expect retaliation. If you have concerns, it’s best you keep them to yourself if you want to keep your job. All senior leadership look the same (good ole boys), and they do not promote from within unless you look like them. Very high turnover. By far the worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,Leadership does not support employees on development and  advancement. If you don’t know the right person you will not be given the opportunities to grow.  Negative culture created by management.
bad,"great workplace if the managers actually cared about you and what was being done while working there. They had great hours and would work with your schedule. the benefits that the company had were great such as 40k, time off. They would work with your schedule if you had an emergency or if you are going to college. As well if you need it for something else personal."
bad,I worked at Davita as an LPN. Although I was a nurse I proformed pct work and was always referred to as just a tech. There is no respect at this company and no opportunity for advancement no matter how hard you work.. the RN was on a power trip but lazy and incompetent. The FA was the worst she kept up a lot of drama and was the biggest liar but self proclaimed First Lady. She abused her authority and if you wasn’t part of her click along with the RN you were in for a bunch of drama and false accusations. The turnover is extremely high. The FA’s own daughter quit because the job was very messy and they work you off the clock.  If you want to wake up with regrets daily and lose any ounce of dignity that you have then this is the place for you if not KEEP SEEKING.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"It's all a lie! They talk a good talk about their caring behaviors, but that only lasts until it gets in the way of profits. The only way you can keep up with everything they want is to work 70 plus hours a week, and that will likely not be enough."
bad,"awful company all about the bottom line not about the team or the people the care for. insurance is awful, hours are long and call outs and bad equipment always an issue."
bad,These people are the worst they do not care about their patients. Everyone backstabbed each other on a daily basis the PCT's that need to be terminated have the most job security. Interesting go figure that one out and get back to me.
bad,"There is a clear hierarchy at the company between who the DVP likes and does not like. If you are in his good graces you are golden, if not you are treated like a second class citizen.  There is absolutely no transparency and you feel like your job is on the line consistently. With so many people quitting you would think they would realize there is a problem but they don't."
bad,Working for Davita felt like joining and unfair cult. The FA of my facility used to be a bartender with no clinical background. I spent more time getting hassled by her and the management than I did actually performing patient care. Davita puts on a great show that they are a fun company that cares about its employees and it’s patients. But in a true reality all they care about is $$$$
bad,"Budget, budget, budget is all you hear feel like I wrk on a assembly line, 15 minutes between patients ( lord forbid if the patient starts bleeding) then everyone else is getting off late."
bad,"They expected one RN to run the entire show for 27 patient and 12 staff, including at times having your own assignment. DaVita is all about the money and does not care at all about patient safety or outcomes."
bad,"If you want to be worked like a dog go to Davita. If you are Hispanic PLEASE GO TO A CLINIC WHERE THERE ARE OTHER HISPANIC TEAMMATES.. No respect. Bullying 24-7 No respect.. $12 to work as if you were an animal or did not get a chance to be hired anywhere else...Extremely looong hours or no hours, best shifts for the FA's friends. Well I would never finish trying to convince you to not work here . Oh; procedures are so important but no one follows them. Take it, get experience and LEAVE...Preceptors are the first that do not follow procedures and then they have the guts to ask you where did you learn what you are doing. Try not to go to a clinic where they baby sit patients because these patients have control over everything; they decide if you are going to take  a standing blood pressure or not, they holler calling the oldest pcts. Be aware; they will tell you will receive a yearly raise and that is not true. Only those with preferential status will receive it and it will be like 25 cents...."
bad,"Not an easy company to work for, unless you follow all their beliefs, you are treated poorly, work/life balance does not exist. manager was not prepared for their job"
bad,My facility was very hard they spoke different languages and made the none Russians feel uncomfortable . They used me for their problems and as soon as they were done with me they let me go
bad,dont be deceived by this company and all the rhetoric that they impart. they always make empty promises and they always go against what they call their core values. very stressful. short staff. always working with a budget. they always have their employees go home before their required hours (under-time) and take out from PTO to make up for lost hours at no fault of the employees. the bosses are very good at you if you acquiesce always  but will kick you out immediately if you are of no use to them anymore. won't recommend this company ever. not well compensated enough for the amount of stress they require us to do. no extra pay for extra task.
bad,"PCT work as much as RN do if not more physical work and are paid only $14/hr and raises are 25 cents a year.  Job hours are 12 to 15 hours a day, on your feet."
bad,"Company does not care about your well being. Will work you to death. Does not consider patient safety. Runs the floor with half the suggested staff ratio putting patients at risk and danger, Will cut every single corner possible to save money by sending you home early and giving you awful schedules."
bad,When i first started everything was wonderful the people were really nice but weeks after the woman that trained me went around and talked bad about me to the other coworkers everyone kept staring at me and it got really uncomfortable to work there..after we had to huddle with the boss it was like she was being defensive taking the other girls side but she kept taking her anger out on me like i did something wrong
bad,"Management is horrible run. Worst place to work. Unclear roles, favoritism with management and employees they only believe you if you have seniority. Made multiple complaints nothing was ever resolved. No investigation done to resolve anything techs do all the work nurses just sit at the computer and do nothing when machines alarm. Horrible place to work would never recommend this place to anyone, run."
bad,"Entire company closing end of year due to lawsuits filed & lost.  Company says not the reason but all employees aware that was the case. Employees could tell changes were coming with the company, lack of meetings, incentives no longer being offered and too many rumors floating around that was never addressed."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Worst place to work. Unsafe practices. Cut too many corners. Revolving door with staff and patients. 18+ work hours a day, minimum 4 days a week. Horrible management, favorites..."
bad,"I was so excited when I started, there.....one for all, all for one....lol!  This is a horrible place to work.  Unrealistic schedules that compromise patient safety.  Cannot recommend this position."
bad,"Do more with less, constantly.  Management favors friends over experience.  Its like being in a high school popularity contest.  Would not recommend.  Not like it used to be"
bad,"this company was very poorly run, could not keep staff working for them.  turnover was bad.  you didn't feel like you mattered and the hours were crazy."
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work there. Please don't be fooled. Management is horrible. No consideration for patient or staff safety. Basically feels like you're working in a factory with a conveyor belt, instead of a medical facility taking care of real people. Quantity over quality. SAD!!!"
bad,"They claim they care about patients and employees, which is untrue.  Their schedule is awful, management is sub par, they are not family oriented like they claim."
bad,"My experience with Davita was extremely terrible. I was an AA. There were a few good days, but a lot of bad ones. My FA was HORRIBLE and she showed it. Found every excuse to get rid of me, and eventually did. I had to go to court and fight for unemployment (which I won). Just a complete nightmare. Apply at your own risk."
bad,They don't care about the employees. Some FAs will even want you to work in unsafe working conditions even though it has been brought to their attention.
bad,"Work schedules are terrible. No flexibility. Nurses are not compensated to match the difficulty of the job, long hours and on-call."
bad,"It was great working at Davita ,it was my firsr dialysis job in was granted a job as a intern in was also hired in the process of training it was a great opportunity for me"
bad,"Davita pushes you to overextend the limits of your RN license. If you do not follow what the manager (who does not have clinical experience) wants, they will fire you. They understaff on a daily basis and overwork nurses and techs. Patients are usually in unsafe situations. Davita's goal is to make as much money as possible, even if patient safety is in question."
bad,"manager was very hostile.  lead via intimidation instead of motivation.  called many of the patients the ""enemy"".  i was unable to continue working in a scenario where the patient's didn't come first."
bad,"Great values as a company, would be nice if they were followed. I would have remained an employee forever if that was the case. Suggestions and complaints fell upon deaf ears. Our team leader was clueless,"
bad,"Company's turn over rate very high, level of pay did not coincide with job description,. Client ratios to employees were unevenly proportioned. Cleaning and antiseptic techniques were not followed properly by all employees. Care and concern for clients was very poor."
bad,"Always short, under loads of pressure, lots of favoritism, gossip, short cutting skills on patients, Pay is only  14.00per hour.  Lots of snitches. Caution when considering applying here."
bad,When I started I did not meet my supervisor face to face for 6 months.  All interviews and meetings were done via phone and/or conference call.  There never seemed to be a team attitude it was more not my job.
bad,"The management is all over the place. In two and a half years, I have had 5+ different supervisors. Only one of the original employees I started with is still currently working for DavitaRx. Also, they are about as transparent as a brick wall. They have been laying off tenured people for months and it seems like the company is doing really poorly as there are talks all around the pharmacy of shutting down before fall even gets here."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,Working for DaVita was a terrible experience.  They overwork you and don't pay you enough. And you're expendable it seems when management doesn't like you. They play favoritism when promoting and don't give you a fair chance. If I could do it all over again I would never work for this company!!!!!
bad,Worst place I’ve ever worked. Poor management. New and many times registrary nurses not knowing what they’re doing. Anyone who complains is retaliated. The best people are kicked out by Davita. They endanger patient safety by having unskilled medical staff including doctors. Also at Davita the patient’s life depends on their insurance status. They’re always short of staff because they Retaliate. Beware people!!!
bad,Hardest part of job patients not getting quality care. Management was  cut throat. Smiled in your face and talked behind your back. A typical day at work was keeping a smile on the patients face and encouraging them.
bad,"I quit my good job at the hospital to work at dialysis and it was one of the worst mistakes of my life. There was no one to train me. There wasn’t any type of orientation. I know nothing about the company, except for the info that I found out on my own. I was given a training book by one of the techs and nothing in the book has been done with me. After two weeks of employment with DaVita., I’m not going back. It was just a waste of my time. t’s just poor management in my opinion."
bad,while i work here I was promised certain training and advancement never delivered. I left the company for another position somewhere else making more money.
bad,"Management is unqualified individuals that got there by popularity. They lack the skills to actually manage and run a team. They say they want you to improve and grow and that they encourage that, but when people start leaving they force you to stay in that department instead of letting you grow. Little to no raises yearly."
bad,"The culture values youth and inexperience.  There is little to no career advancement, no over-time is permitted, and favoritism is the management style.  There are far better places to work."
bad,Worst place I have ever worked. Lack of compassion is appalling. Money hungry corporate incompetents. Sorely lacking in appropriately trained management.
bad,Initially this company wants you to believe that you are valued. Eventually if you do not follow their practices you will be shunned or ostracized. Hopefully that is something that makes you happy. It is highly controlling.
bad,Management lies to your face. You work with unsafe numbers of patients. It's terrible.  Low pay.  Close at 8:30pm and have to be there the next day at 4:30am.
bad,"Poorly managed by GFA, no work life balance, no assistance/ support frim upper management,  non fairness as it relates to staff and patients. Rude patients and staff."
bad,"A money making company with little care for employees, training is sub par, and patients suffer from being rushed in and out to make room for more and more treatments"
bad,"Davita will get in the door them pull the wool over your eyes after training. During training, you are presenting with a lot of cheer leading and coaching but, once you hit the treatment floor all of that is gone. Reality sets in and you are alone and trying to do the best you can. Even when you go to other clinics to help out they expect you to know everything and offer little to no assistance. It is a hot mess! You can work you tail off and you will not get rewarded but if you are a butt kisser you will get promoted and receive decent annual raises instead of the .10 and .15 cents per year salary increases Davita will offer to the technicians that spend the majority of their work day taking care of the patients and it the primary reason for the companies existence! Management spends more time trying to decide how can they add additional job duties to my already hectic workday and pay me less money."
bad,"Horrible Company. Makes it appear as though they care about their employees and their patients, but really, all they care about is the profit. Nurse to patient ratio was high. Shifts always went longer than written on schedule due to the workload expected to be completed by the nurse. Often felt alone and unsafely responsible for the management of too many patients at one time."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Without a doubt the worst place to work. Management lies, staff is unfriendly, recruiter promised things that have not happened. Feel under appreciated and harassed."
bad,"DaVita does not focus on employees as it claims, the focus is on revenue recovery in the department I worked in. It was complete 84 claims a day or be fired."
bad,"At the start was great,  learned a lot and began to understand a lot.  But once you start your work life takes over everything.  U no longer have a life outside Davita."
bad,lack of training created frustrations for me to continue working there. I didn't get the support I needed and I had to work mandatory over-time 3 out of the 5 months I was there so I resigned.
bad,"The management is only their for themselves, too many secrets and Work Life balance does not exist. This is very “for profit” and that is all they care about. Horrible work environment!"
bad,"early hours, how to operate as a dialysis nurse, and train new staff, management were deceitful and lied about me thus terminating employment with them.  It was done in such a way to try to destroy ones career.  A review of my work history would have shown them that I was a good employee."
bad,"No work / home balance"
bad,I gave my all to davita for nothing.  Pay is as little as possible for the most work possible.  The minute my health became compromised and i was not able to work with good reason i was treated poorly.  Management stop speaking to me and disability made it absolutely difficult to get benefits or pay.  After working there for 3 years all the benefits i paid into just went to garbage.  It benefit me to leave the company.  I would never recommend davita to ANYONE.
bad,"There was no support to employees from the Management, it is a very cutthroat environment, there is no job advancement in this company. The company is a very stressful place to work at."
bad,upon arrival seems like great company to work for.  I believe they grew faster than they expected adn the industry became very cut throat! advancements in the company are almost non existing.
bad,"Not the best environment if you want a to be in a place that allows you to move up nor the best place to be if you  do not like drama. Everyone there wants to know your personal life business, the manager herself gets upset if you do not share your life outside of work with her. The nurse that is under the manager is a very jealous person, doesn't like to see other people shine at all. She will even go as far as take your hours away so that you can not make a living."
bad,This has done a total 360. It's not the same as it used to be the managers don't really care about the patients well-being  they care only about meeting numbers
bad,"Never knowing what hour your day will end. Some days can be as long as 20 hours. On call 3 days a week. Moving heavy equipment from floor to floor. No place for an inexperienced nurse. You are completely on your own once you get your assignment, no one to assist if you run into trouble. Very stressful work environment. They'll tell you anything when they are hiring. Some of it ends up not being true."
bad,"Hands down, the worst company I have ever worked for. This is based on MY personal experience only, others may or may not agree."
bad,If you value family or personal time do NOT work for this employer they have an extremely high turn over rate for a reason management is horrible and rude the hours are long and the workday is stressful
bad,"extremely poor management, low wages, no lunch or other breaks at all. Long days of work are expected plus on call on top of that. High turnover rate and management wonders why we cant keep or get staff"
bad,"If I could give this company a negative rating I would. The management is terrible. The employees are Clicky and if you dont get along with them and how they work, they find reasons to get you in trouble. Also if you get in trouble management doesnt give you a chance to represent yourself. Brook sova manager of the clinic I was at was too worried about finding a man than worrying about the problems that was going on in her clinic"
bad,"Very busy everyday but management is not on the same agenda. I learned how to be a trainer. Workplace culture had gone downhill."
bad,"Lack of responsibility, no ownership from management of problems, huge safety concerns at certain facilities, and teamwork at certain facilities is nonexistent."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"The people you interact with everyday and know you by your work recognize your achievements. The corporation itself? Not so much -to them, you're just a nameless cog, cheap and easily replaced."
bad,My day to day job enatils managing my team. I provide evidence based care to my patients on adaily bases. When my manager is not in clinic I have to be the back up FA to maintain a safe enviornment for our patients.
bad,"The specialty pharmacy was the worst place I have ever worked in my 10 years of experience as a pharmacy technician. They did not have any procedure or best practices and when they told you to do something they would change the process 5 days later and you would get verbally assaulted because you were not doing the recently updated process that was never disclosed to you. They also would not bill the customers correctly. They would tell them an estimated copay and when the patient would get a bill about 3 months after receiving the medication and the bill is no where near the copay they were estimated, usually hundreds of dollars high than estimated. The specialty pharmacy is closing down in the fall of 2017 and understand why completely. It was the blind leading the blind at that place."
bad,They over work and under pay you with unsafe patient ratios. They want to add more tasks with out compensation. They do not care about patient safety and there is no accountability for those that call in sick on a regular basis. Management just wants to look good by saving money and working their way up the chain.
bad,"Everything that I was told during the hiring process was a lie. You will work very long hours and never know what time your shift ends if you work in the acute setting. I have worked 20 hours with a 30 min. lunch break. You work the same days as your ""on-call"". So if you have the weekend call it is also your assigned work weekend (48hrs). Very unsafe practices in my opinion. There is no cap on how many times you get called in and/or hours worked with on-call. Health coverage is very expensive with a lot of out of pocket costs. Senior staff use seniority to bully other staff. There is no shift differential."
bad,"One of the worst overall job experiences I have ever had. Benefits were not horrible, pay was incredibly low based on the job requirements, very little training and support for the position I was assigned to. Management was handled very poorly at the facility level and above."
bad,"Back stabbing, horrible work life balance and major work laws broken on a daily basis. They will turn on you in a second. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"Grand Rapids Michigan office acute care dialysis.  So happy to get out of there. Management does not listen, talks over you and treats you like a child. Hours are feast or famine, either you work long hours at below market pay, or you are shorted.  Lots of low census. If you get overtime or are called in to run a treatment in the middle of the night you are shorted regular scheduled hours later in the week because ""we want to avoid overtime"". You are responsible for your own training.  Lots of pressure to work off the clock...calling hospital before you punch in to get report from floor nurse. Study at home for your training. Requirement to *memorize* policies from Davita, and each hospital you work (which of course is impossible). Stuck in isolation room in full iso gear with confused patients for 3-4 hour treatment--no bathroom breaks for you. Requirement to use your phone, but do not compensate you for this...unless you provide an accounting of costs incurred each month, and costs must meet a threshold before you get reimbursement. Strange corporate ""rah rah"" culture...company is cheap cheap cheap.  Will do everything to save a buck."
bad,"Management is more worried about the budget or the status quo rather than proper equipment and workload. To put it plainly, they take shortcuts that jeopardize patient safety."
bad,DaVita is a fortune 500 and great company to work for and the workplace culture reminds you of an extended family. I recommend anyone who is interested in working in Dialysis take a look at DaVita.
bad,"Very poor training, you will be responsible for everything that happens, FA does not care about you, just works for her bonus, no respect from pct's who work on their own, don't like to be told what to do (some of them). You will have to work over 14 hours non-stop not even to take a break, hardly to eat something. The lives of the  patients are on the pct's hands but are your responsibility, which is  very dangerous for your license, definitely it's not worth it."
bad,"Toxic environment.  Most all management people discuss other employees private business in front of and to everyone.  Very unprofessional staff, cussing and yelling at each other on the floor."
bad,"Would never work for this company!! Beware a ton of false promises and they take advantage of you.  The expectations are unrealistic, they are a crooked company and are defrauding the federal government, can't wait until they get caught.  The CEO should be in jail."
bad,"Being a PCT is one of the hardest, most fulfilling jobs I have ever had. I have done Reuse, Admin. Asst., and training as well as several other duties. The job it self is great! The pay and benefits leave a lot to be desired, and somehow they seem to think that buying lunch all the time makes up for the low pay. Not to mention the fact that they have Administrators that are flat out mean, bullies who create hostile work environments for all but their ""favorites"", and upper management knows about it, covers it up, lets it continue, and even promotes the offender! If you get lucky and find a good Administrator/Clinic, it won't last long. The good ones always get burnt out or run off. And, if you contact your ROD or DVP or HR, it will just get worse for you. There is a non-retaliation policy that is not worth the paper it is written on. I often wonder if the CEO who preaches all this wonderful stuff about the company, actually has any clue what really goes on in these clinics? The company would be absolutely wonderful if it really was how Corporate claims it should be."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"I gave my heart and soul to DaVita, loved all of my patients and always went above and beyond to please my FA, and my teammates."
bad,If I could give this Job a Zero I would. I worked in the Clearfield PA Clinic....... Worst job ever! The employee's are super mean.... I cried on lunch brakes and even went in the bathroom to cry. The training was all about getting the patient on and off the machine's not about there well being. You could never be fast enough and if you took your time with a patient you were huffed at swore at and talked about right in front of you. The PCT Trainer and FA are mother and daughter in law so makes it very hard to say how you feel because the FA doesn't believe a word said. This place isn't healthy to be employed at trust me!
bad,"Horribly unorganized, unprofessional people.  From the top of this weak effort merger to the very bottom.  Absolutely you will not enjoy the culture nor the abuse."
bad,"Unprofessional coworkers, overly middle managed workplace with bizarre cult like business model made this a difficult place to care for my patients. Expectation to do other people's work when they were ineffective at time management and unable to think fast was also a real drag as well. The fact of 3 staff quitting due to unprofessional middle management and middle management continuing to bully remaining staff is mind boggling to say the least. This position sharpened my skills so it wasn't a total loss, but the company and upper management doesn't have a clue about staff retention and also doesn't at all care. Management is quick to find fault and fail to recognize staff for hard work or dedication to patients in general. Do not make the mistake of letting your guard down if you decide to work for davita. Keep your eyes wide open and never, ever turn your back because odds are if you do, you'll quickly be pulling a knife out of it that a smiling coworker has neatly plunged into it."
bad,"Started working in the ""Davita Star Learning"" program  set up to provide dialysis training. The training was SOOOO UNORGANIZED it became frustrating creating an environment that it was impossible to learn. Classroom consists of everyone from RN to janitors, some who been w/the company from 8wks to 1day. Staff members from RN to ppreceptors are rude & welcoming. Tech precepting RN due to staff shortage. Transferred from location to location working as early as 4am to after 10pm in the same week due to the drastic scheduling. Different machines depending on the facility which causes further frustration during training since you are expected to know who to operate all."
bad,Run! No home /work life balance!On call is terrible! A total waste of my time! Hospital staff is the only good aspect job! Run!
bad,"It's all about productivity, they could care less about the patients.,"
bad,The company only cares about making money not about the patients.  It is a good place to work for a college student or someone getting back into the workforce.  The company is very unprofessional and the pay and benefits are not good for someone with years experience.
bad,Went thru acquisition and it was pure torture! The acquisition team had no clue about policies and procedures it was total chaos
bad,"If you want to work for a place that puts the patients life at risk for death by not following protocol then this is the place for you. The preceptors couldn't even explain the process, parts of the machines and why the function. The staff would never observe the patients while getting dialysis the would always congregate to the nurses station unless a patient was yelling for them or the machines were alarming. Not the kind of health care facility I would want my worst enemy let alone my family getting treatment, they are all dangerous. Falsifying calibration, documents, water checks. And you were the odd man out if you didn't go along with this. The most enjoyable part of the job were the patients please God help them. And management only really cared about budget and how many patients they could get in to make a profit. The powers that be either have no idea these things are going on or they do not care! Out of sight out of mind. What this company needs is a surprise inspection from the state and Medicare since this is their major way of getting paid from patients."
bad,I started with DaVita mid last year and worked my butt off for these people. I tried to jump in and help when it was needed. Went above and beyond at any functions that took place. Spent tons of $$ from my own pocket for group projects. As time continues along and a tragedy happens in my family and for missing 1 day when UPPER Management sends you home I am told they are letting me go. So news flash to anyone wanting to work in the billing area of the Labs....DON'T and run as fast as you can. Company makes way to much money to just throw good honest hard working people away. As other reviews have stated if you are not in the click then you are just baggage they will find a way to dump.
bad,At DaVita Villagehealth you love working with teammates who truly care about you as a person. I have learned so much about patient care management and the kidneys. DaVita is big on education.
bad,Standard company where you can serve and earn money. Well equipped and great technologies. Safe work place.Independent work.More chances to grow.
bad,Unexceptable pay for the responsibility that you are required to have. Sometimes had to work 14 & 20 hours straight to catch up with team. Was asked to be janitor in addition to regular work load. Management didn't even have experience in a medical setting. Patients were treated like cattle instead of human beings. More worried about census than clients. Worst medical work experience of my life.
bad,Think hard before you join this village. Do your research. Lots of long hours and long days. High turn over in management & other areas.
bad,"DaVita was never staffed properly, and is dangerous for RNs and their licenses.  They also cheated me out of my PTO when I left, and told lies about me to their HR reps.  In the OKC region at least, they are a terribly ran company, and regional execs have no clue what they are doing, and care nothing of company loyalty.  They claim to be a village and a community to both employees and patients, but all they care about is the fact that they are a fore-profit company."
bad,"Its a nice place to work but the benefits are way below the market and parking is $6.00 per day. Horrible work life balance, travel lots of meetings."
bad,the company is all lies when it comes to taking care of the employess
bad,Learned so much for this office and the doctor. Loved working here....
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"They will hire you as a temp and if then your manager likes you then you can become permanent. They say it takes about 3 months to become perm but for some people it took over 9 months (It is all about favoritism). It is a high school environment. You say one word that someone doesn't like, they will back-stab you and raises are based on what your co-workers think of you. Every computer has MSN messenger so if someone doesn't like you then they will message another co-worker right behind your back. No luck going to HR because they say they monitor computers but that is a lie. You might think they are paying you well but it will take at least 6 more years with the company to make another dollar. I am sad I had to work here because nothing is organized and I beg please really look into the company before you apply. People walk out without even having another job offer and man they will really show their true colors once you put in your two weeks notice. WATCH OUT!"
bad,Working in dialysis is hard and difficult but can be rewarding. Davita profides the arena
bad,"KDC at macon, ga 31201 worst place ever to work. Horrible hours, poor management."
bad,"Worst company I’ve ever worked for! Management had NO idea what they we’re doing, they would set goals so far out of reach people would quit because of it. Patient care was a joke they have an extremely high turn over rate with Nurse’s. The technical side of the company that handles repairs used un-qualified techs and most of the time they could never talk you through a problem. I will never deal with this company again from a working perspective or have any relatives or friends use their services for care. HORRIBLE COMPANY.."
bad,I learned that with working with individual who have renal failure are not the most social people to help and talk to. But you have those rare person who do not let their illness get to them and acknowledge that their life is not over when they are deal with renal failure. Sometime it make take assessment of your life when you meet someone who has to accept this life altering event.
bad,I learned to strive to move forward and look for better Opportunity in a work place
bad,"Favortism "
bad,I worked 12 hour days 3 days a week.  We cannulated the patients and put them on the machines and monitored them as they ran.  We got real close to them because we saw them 3 times a week all year long.  The fact that most of them end up passing away is very hard to deal with.
bad,Started the day at 5am or 6am with a rush to set up dialysis machines for pt arrival.  Pt needles placed and v/s done and pt is ready for a 3 to 4 hour treatment.   Pt are monitored q1/2 hour as to pt b/p and fluid removal. Each nurse in a pod has a patient care tec to help with a 6 patient assignment. It is up to the nurse to manage all treatment and to keep pt safe. Hardest part is being on a time . Pt on and patients come off and it is a race to get ready for the next set of patients. The most enjoyable part of the job is the patients.
bad,Never go and work here. One of the worst companies I have ever worked with. Managers dont have time and they are not bothered about the quality of the work produced. Just believe the words from other team mates. Not well oraganized and less process oriented
bad,"Typical work day 7 am until you are done that means anywhere from 5pm to 10 pm. Days are advertised as 10 hr work days but usually are 12 to 16 hr work days. Unless you are on call and then you could wind up working for 24 hrs straight. Mnmgt c/o everything. You never hear about what you are doing right. Mnmgt does not have boundaries. She will text you on your days off and expect you to do things that are not related to nursing. For example: inventory & correct billing because the person that is responsible for that doesn't. And then mnmgt c/o overtime. Mgmnt makes a typical schedule like this: work M/T/W/Th on-call off Friday. Work Sat on-call/Su/M/Tues on-call, off 2 days etc, etc. "
bad,This is one of the!! worst companies to work for. The focus is not on patient care but about making money. Staff moral was low and the FA was rarely there.there was no team effort but every man for himself.It was an awful environment to work in!! I'm glad I left and would never work for DaVita again.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Dialysis is dialysis no matter where you go, but it does not have to be they way Davita runs it. I have no clue how this company expects a charge nurse to do all the things they expect. Because of the ""budget"" and SWCs the other nurse on the floor is expected to take pts for a period during the day, that leaves the charge nurse to cover the rest of the unit. Also, because of the SWCs the end of the day is a disaster waiting to happen. The charge nurse is left with one other PCT and 6 pts!! The have made it so everybody's focus is the budget and SWCs forget good pt care and safety. As charge I have to keep the focus of pt care not the constant question of ""what time do I get off?"". In my clinic with only 16 chairs I am expected to work from 430am until 7pm. I never find the time to do monthly charting unless I want to work past 7pm or come in on my off day...NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!!"
bad,"All those reading the reviews, and considering working at DaVita, please run the other way. It's absolutely not worth it."
bad,they love to recruit other from other countries because they feel that us citizen will not do the work as hard .
bad,"Typical day is rought with too many patients per nurse and tech's who are either burned out or incompentent. Managment lies and are back stabbers and it felt like a ""cult."" Enjoyable part of the job was going on trips and chair massages"
bad,"Don't drink the Koolaid. The ""values"" are a farce. It is a good place to get experience and learn... but then move on."
bad,worked there for 15 years and one day a nurse lied on me and i was gone management sucked!!!!!
bad,"I was in charge of Faifeild clinic, St Vinvents, Milford hospital, Shelton clinic , Norwalk and Greenwich hospital . I would be a feild Technicain driving to these diffrent hospitals and clinics in these areas in my own car. My jub duties were maintaining, cleaning and disefecting these machines on a daily 24 hour basis. I was able to answer questions to staff, nurses or medical personel that had poblems with the machines."
bad,I worked for the company and applied for new job advancements for which I was more then qualified only to have the jobs given to less qualified applicants. The regional operations director told his managers to hire from outside the company so they would not cannibalize the VILLAGE. What a joke that they feel so highly of their own help they give the desirable jobs to the outsiders. I also worked for a Manager who was a back stabbing mealy mouthed condescending pr!ck who would talk down to people and say things you wanted to hear but would never follow up on them. I had many employees who had not had an employee evaluation in 2-3 years and when they asked him to do one he said upfront that he would not retro back 3 years. And the manager made inappropriate comments to female staff members all the time yet the company just keeps him in his current position.
bad,HIghly qualified individuals working in really stupid jobs. The fun there is all manufactured. They closed down the department to have a baby shower for an fellow employee -- meaning you have to go whether you like the person or not; or even know them. I'm way to old to do that.
bad,No recognition to employees. Favoritism was sooooo obvious.
bad,"Ran by people who know nothing about health care.  Nurses are used as techs and don't have time to do licensed work."
bad,"This is the most unprofessional poorly managed company I ever worked for. The pay is terrible. No incentives, they nothing for their employees, not even a Christmas party, bonus, lunch- NOTHING! The demands are high and the budget and rewards are low to non-existent. They treat you like a robot. I would not recommend it to ANYONE"
bad,There is no opportunity for advancement. Unfair wages and no working with scheduling. Management is very poor and gives preferential treatment. There is no shift guarantee and the shifts are irregular
bad,Davita is a horrible company to work for. You are overworked and underpaid. They will use you in the minute you are unable to do something they would treat you like s***. They show favoritism and there is no work-life balance. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. Oh and management sucks especially the region 3 GFA
bad,"My experience was horrible from the start.  No plan for orientation, very negative clinic mostly due to the manager not having ANY dialysis experience.   Complete full staff turnover  in 3 months, couldn't keep new staff either.  Patient safety was of no concern.  Just the budget and short staffing.  I feel sorry for the patients."
bad,The pay is horrible and you can effort to work consistently over 40 hours a week. They only hire friends and family or people with no experience or relevant training that have bachelor degrees from paid to get into private schools. Promises are not kept. The culture is toxic beyond belief and people don't practice what they preach. Easily the worst company I've ever worked for.
bad,"During the interview, I was told that orientation would be in one particular area, then about a week prior to starting the job, I received an email stating the orientation location would be a hour further away. I was also told during the interview that the on call would be one week a month, and about three weeks prior to ending orientation I was informed I would always be on call! The director accused me of not being ""flexible enough""."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Childish and unprofessional employees and management. I have for this company for almost 2 years and never have I worked for a facility that is so unorganized, unprofessional, and unconcerned regarding the overall well being of their patients."
bad,"DaVita is a horrible place to work for an nurse. Nurse to patient ratio is extremely unsafe, hours are terrible and clinics are run by technicians that  often have extremely limited medical experience."
bad,"Quality of everything varies widely between clinics. I worked at clinics that were great.. good scheduling of patients, great teammates. I worked at other clinics that were literally falling apart, rude patients, and scheduling that was literally impossible. I did not sit at all during 12-16 hour shifts."
bad,"This place has a constant stream of changing leadership. There is a new manager almost every 2-3 months like clockwork and as such they are unable to be consistent in they medical care provided. They also frequently work 4 shift of 14-16 hours every week. There is no such thing as work life balance here and management is clueless as to why their employee base in unsatisfied. If you want tons of overtime, this place is great. However, if you prefer a set schedule and fixed hours, then you are better off applying elsewhere."
bad,"The experience was horrifying, coworkers were evil,and management and upper management did nothing about it."
bad,"They stuff the culture down your throat hoping you won't notice that it's all a lie. ""A community first and a company second"" is a tag they like to say but it's not true. They overwork and underpay. They play favorites and if you aren't one then you are expected to pick up the slack and if you can't, you are out. Just look up all the law suits, that will tell you all you need to know."
bad,I happened to get this job by chance. Been at my current office for 2 years. Wanted to wait til they actually transitioned to Optum but I dont see that being an opportunity because management plays favoritism a lot. I was always getting in trouble for things that had nothing to do with me but because the administrator in the office I worked didn't want to ruffle the feathers of those who were there before her she would blame me. She never took the medical assistants side on issues within the office. The clinical nurses don't do anything but sit in office. The office never has any coverage when someone is out so if want to feel like a slave this may be your place. Oh... and you also have a physician that likes killing her difficult patients and corporate will not do anything about it.
bad,"I worked at DaVita for about a year. I was so excited to start there and met one of my best friends there. The job, however, was awful. The management was absolutely terrible and there was some racial favoritism shown as well by the boss and charge nurse. The staff did not really seem to make the patients the top priority. It was more so about mking sure the blame was always turned around on the techs. You have no freedom to have a work and home balance."
bad,"Worst place to work at. You’re much better off with a different company. Pay is very low and you are overworked all the time. Very stressful job. Being overworked with very little pay, ungrateful patients and having coworkers that aren’t helpful doesn’t motivate you to work."
bad,"this is a for profit health care company that puts profits before patients, they treat the employees like they are disposable and force employees to go to a camp to learn how to think like them ""brain washing""..."
bad,Working for DaVita Dialysis was a horrible experience they didn't even have set trainers the people that trained me did not seem enthusiastic because they were training me as they were working with seven patients at a time also the stuff that had been there for a while we're very verbally abusive and rude this is the eat your young type of place I do not suggest this company to anybody also the nurses are stuck-up and evil they treat you like trash just because supposedly you're not on their level I've never seen such a horrible work environment the facility I worked in had four people quit in one week but they blame it on the people they hire LOL
bad,The culture at DaVita is toxic and the management is horrible. The most enjoyable part of the job at Davita was working with the people. The hardest part of the job was working with management.
bad,"Your PDR is rated based off their core values but not on your performance. To move up or not be picked on, just suck-up to your supervisor/manager. The management thrives on that. The training I received as a Patient Account Rep. was horrible. The trainer talked more about her fake eye lashes, eyebrows and her second job as a coach for weight watchers than teach us about our job. She was not sure on what we needed to do in the learning journals and referred to our buddys. I have a college degree and need to work in a more professional setting from leaders I can learn and grow. This is not the place."
bad,"DaVita and Fresenius are the same, they do not value their employees.  Management is poor and they treat techs like low-life garbage.  They do not pay a living wage for the HARD work and LONG hours we put in."
bad,"DaVita made a lot of promises and didn’t follow through. The Star Learning Program was incredible. They offer tuition reimbursement but only about $3000 a year which does not come close to covering tuition. They have only one charge nurse on the floor so if an emergency arises with your patient, you have to wait until she/he’s finished tending to another patient."
bad,"Slow to no advancement or appreciation for internal employees. They prefer to hire outside people who will make way more than you and then you have to train them.  Overt double standards for performance expectations and project assignments.  Even when the powers that be are made aware of low morale due to unfair treatment,  nothing changes except for negative repercussion for the concerned employee."
bad,No work life balance they expect your life and family to be put on hold while you slave for them and their “mission” which is a bunch of bull! Run from this company they’re hypocrites
bad,The regional and divisional management do not care about people or safety they only care about getting bigger bonuses for themselves. It’s very sad because the CEO has a great vision and wants great culture. In regional level it is far from cultural vision that was designed
bad,"***If you are a minority be prepared to be to be watched like a hawk."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Short staffed.  Upper management are all about themselves.    They do not lead with Davila’s Core Values: 7 in total.  Budget, Budget, budget!!!   Poor processes also"
bad,"What happens when you give some long standing figureheads absolute power and throw in a dash of management with the worst communication skills? Everyone is out for themselves. Full stop. Revolving door.  Typical of most large corporations, except the CT market has become the most toxic.  RNs and PCTs do care about their patients, unfortunately the greed for the almighty dollar pushes borderline unsafe practices. Ratios in CT are teetering on inhumane, DaVita local management likes to give it that extra nudge. Ask ANY RN/PCT/any staff in the centers. Don't take my word for it."
bad,"Was promised a lot of training but were so short staffed (dangerously at times) that didn't happen.  Clinical Manager was mean, argumentative and rarely there while the clinic was open.  She was fired not long after I left the company"
bad,Management is terrible. All about numbers. Not very much patient care or concern about the team and patients. However you can benefit the company is all they care about
bad,"They hire mangers who have no medical knowledge, They care more about making money then they do the patients. They set up the teammate to fail, provide poor training and follow up on complaints. If you do complain, they try to fire you."
bad,"Very stressful working environment. Management insist on Down staffing each shift, which leads to staff leaving after putting patients on machine , without recording vital information such as pre weights and vital signs.You will be forced to get your eight hour job done in 4 hours so they can send you home to save money.Calling out of work even if you are very I'll is not toletated. There is always a shortage of staff as the turn over rate is very high .If you worked more than 40 hours a week , you will not be paid for the extra time.There is no time and a half paid for over time worked.Training is not adequate .You will not know more than  half of the things you are suppose to do at the end of your training. Teammates are pushed to get every patient on treatment early and then all the patients are due to get off at the same time, which is very dangerous for patient care and your nursing license."
bad,"Davita looks great on paper and will wow you with the ""team"" culture but it is a vat of illegal, immoral and dangerous practices that threaten the safety of patients and teammates alike. Administrators are grunts not allowed to manager but simply expected to do what they're told. Patient's are just numbers. If a patient has commercial insurance then you are encouraged to treat them with more privilege than those that dont, including moving patients around and bumping patients to accommodate commercial patients. You are asked to push initiatives that are akin to kickbacks and you are penalized if you question any practices that seem inappropriate. The turn-over rate is more than 50% which is indicative of the toxic culture. The C-suite is unwilling to address or own the problems that exist and continue to pass blame off to administrators. Average career-span for an administrator is two 2 years with many not making it past a year. The workload is not manageable and you are expected to be on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. RNs and technicians routinely call off without repercussion which means patients are forced to go without treatment. You are not provided with adequate tools to complete the work assigned and consistently harassed to do things that are impossible. What's more, Davita has such a poor reputation in the healthcare community that recruiters tend to steer clear. They will sell you a beautiful story but the truth is far less attractive. Do yourself a favor and forego this career killer. Do your research as the number of lawsuits Davita has lost for its behavior"
bad,"I worked as a Registered Nurse in Jacksonville, FL. This region is HORRIBLE! The techs run the show. Most of them are untrained, uneducated, and immoral. They come and train with other techs and then tell you the RN what to do with your license. You get no support from the Facility Administrators most of which are former techs or secretaries and have no experience as well. Many of them do not know how to work on the floor , so if you are short, they want you to do your nursing duties and work as a tech. The hours are long! You’ll get there 4:45 am and leave when the last patient does sometimes 8 or 9 pm. There is no help with the upper bosses. The GFA is useless and so is the ROD. If you quit they keep you on prn because their retention numbers are so low. It makes it look like you are still there. The work is unsafe for your license. I practically trained with a tech for 5 days and she did not show me a single thing. She was more concerned with her boyfriend and booking trips. I went to management several times and asked for trainings to no avail. Two people got stuck with needles and nothing was done for hours. The FA did not know the needle stick protocol and no education was provided to the employees. They test the machines with dirty lines. Many don’t  clean the machines and chairs between patients leaving blood everywhere. They cheat you out your money and make many false promises. Raises are only given to thise they are cool with. Other employees in the building overstep their boundaries and the FA does not say anything. I was threatened notified upper management and"
bad,"I worked at several clinics in the Muskegon area.  Stay away from Apple Ave. You'll regret ever walking into the clinic.  PCT culture is awful.  No room for advancement. Management and PCTs are catty and quite rude to new people.  If the number of patients decreases, then your hours will decrease drastically. Dialysis is a rough healthcare field to due the fluctuation of patients.  Pay checks are always different. Not all clinics are like Apple Ave in Muskegon, but its sink or swim there."
bad,"Tenured employees are not treated well. There is no room for advancement. Management is horrible and clueless."
bad,"Davita plays favorites. If you aren't a cheerleader you aren't look at as a promotable teammate. Pay raises are nothing,. 37 cents a year sometimes less. They thought implement employment levels would help but it doesn't, job expectations are too far to reach so you'll never get a raise. Currently employed here and don't want to be, looking to leave asap. Not a good place to be to much drama"
bad,My average day at work is to come in at 4am turn on machine and place them in rinse. Go to water room and make bicarb for the day. Start setting up patients machines and start calling patients in for treatment.
bad,I worked for Davita Labs for 2 1/2 years.  My manager was an extremely paranoid individual and cut throat.  He and the Human Resource Director were continually looking for reasons to suspend or eliminate teammates from their positions due to their own personal high level of mistrust.  This made for a stressful work environment along with minimal cost of living increases and lack of bonus'.  Communication was poor.
bad,"Management set unrealistic goals to avoid giving bonuses and when HealthCare Partners merged with Davita, the whole company went downhill. Davita hired people with degrees but no experience which caused a lot of chaos and extra work for the employees who had been there for years. To move up in the company you have to know someone. Davita does not treat their staff fairly unless you know one of the higher ups in the corporate office. HR is a joke, if you go to them with a problem they turn it around to put the blame on you and eventually they find a nonsense reason to get rid of you."
bad,Poor management. Low pay. Very deceptive with the bonuses. Old equipment. Small work group. A lot of favoritism in this environment. Very long hours..
bad,"fast pace envirnment you are on your feet for long hours. While working here I have learned a lot about dialysis, it is a three month training of lots of imformation. Mannagement on the other hand is the worst part of the job.  If you are not in the click you are basically looked over, retaliated against if you complain or report anyone in the click. You have to be very careful with management at job! you better matke sure you know who is friends or in the click with management before reporting anyone to management because you would find yourself retaliated against!  The work culture her is fast past and sometimes a team effort in certain facilities but not all.  As a RN the hardest part of the job was making sure you protect your license all the time!  please make sure you really verify the prescription, and make sure you follow up with the techs are putting in the machines because if something happens it will fall all on the RN. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing and taking care of the patients hands down! I love the fact i was able to bill a good repore with the patients i servered and able to get t know them.  To recap PLEASE KEEP AN EYE OUT WITH MANAGEMENT BECUASE THEY ARE CUT THROAT!!! wish you luck!"
bad,"They expect one nurse to do the work of 3 or 4 nurses Too many hours, too little pay, too much work on nurses and techs, difficult to get PTO days off because of lack of staffing, poorly managed organization with too many demands on their clinic staff for chronic patients. Management rarely there or involved.  A great job for administration & management, always in meetings or traveling when they are there.  Turnover rate high because of this."
bad,stay out of the trailblazer region(Wrightsville GA especially. All snobby country executives who cant control home but wanna control adults. I have never worked for a place where racism was displayed so blatantly
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"DaVita talks a good game with their ""one for all, all for one,"" high-priced showmanship, but in the end they do not care about their employees. It is a business that is highly micromanaged, with very little autonomy for nurses and unreachable goals set constantly. If you do happen to meet their goals, they change them the next week to something unreachable. They do offer some good catering and some nice parties, but it's all just show. In the end it is all about the bottom line."
bad,Would recommend to anyone with an RN license. Salary is competitive. Company is always growing. Benefits offered are good. Company is considered as a village and fosters teamwork.
bad,"If you're new to the medical field this might not be a good place to start. It's very stressful, the hours are extremely long and you never know when you'll be getting off unless the RN says so. You get little to no breaks besides lunch and MAYBE a 15 on 12 hour days. Management isn't the best, they aren't understanding of outside situations (seriously I'll child, or family member, etc). It's not accommodating for people with families and who go to school because your shift might last longer than you thought, I come home exhausted mentally and physically. The only thing I enjoyed there are the patients. The pay is abhorrent for the work you do."
bad,"Long hours. Little to no recognition from management. Davita tries to find ways to give low ratings for performance in order to give little to no pay increases based on merit. Overall, it is a terrible company to work for and you would be wise not to apply for a position at Davita."
bad,"I loved working with the patients and I miss them terribly.  On the other hand, the work environment is terrible.  We were always short staffed.  They always hire nurses straight out of school who leave a year later and move on.  At DaVita there is a very high turnover rate for both nurses and technicians.  Morale is low.  Nurses are expected to do technician work.  I did not feel like a nurse at all while working there and I know that I am worth more than that."
bad,"The branch I worked for was terrible, completely understaffed I was overworked and expected to do way more then I was trained to. I may be biased but this job has turned me off to health care all toghter"
bad,"DaVita allows anyone with a 4 year degree to manage a facility. Regardless of communication skills or lack there of. Non-nursing individuals manage nurses with very little knowledge of what nurses do. This is a  task oriented environment, with no time for TLC or communication. So sad...."
bad,"Very hostile work enviornment with little to no involvement from leadership. They do not recruit for quaility, they just need a warm body in the clinic. Patient care is awful. The way the patients are spoken to is disheartening and the way they are treated is even worse.  LPNs are ticking time bombs, always exploding at team mates and patients alike. The FA and CSS try to manage the clinic hiding behind a desk and computer rather then being on the floor engaging the team and promoting a productive day. No positive reinforcement from leadership at all, they focus on the negative instead of assisting eager teammates to turn weaknesses into strengths. They are leading by very poor example which has affected the delivery of adequate patient care and a horrible morale with team members. DCI and Fresenius clinics are your better choices, not only for patients but health care professionals as well."
bad,The manager in the Tacoma office is rude to the point of meanness. Favoritism runs rampant in the office. If you make a small mistake you are called out (shamed) in front of your co-workers. Would not let an employee take a couple of days off over a weekend to go see her 90 year old mother who is in poor health. I guess you wait until your parent dies to see them for the last time.
bad,"This company is a joke. It doesn't stand behind its core values or mission statement. I worked here for 6 months and I feel it was a waste of time. It's a very non teamwork centered environment, and your leadership doesn't care about that either. We were short on a Saturday (21 chair clinic divided into 2 pods; 3 techs and 1 nurse was there which is AGAINST state standards and I'll get into that soon) my ""clinical coordinator"" or lack there of came in to check a few things, we were getting ready to do turn and she walks out because she had to take her daughter horseback riding! Are you kidding me? Your team is drowning and you leave?! One of the techs that was there was PRN and we'd call on her when we were short, she vowed she'd never come back to help our clinic out again; that really says something. Speaking of state, how about all the illegal practices the clinics use to get by? I'm sorry easy or not, wrong is wrong. Ethics over everything. I didn't want to work for such a place where they are running out of heparin or ""forgetting"" to disinfect people's arms before cannulation. Crossing people when your not supposed to, testing machines with dirty dialyzers, running the clinic with less than the state regulated amount of employees, letting patients fight with each other and stepping in to stop it, letting patients use racial slurs to and cussing the staff out, patients that threatens the staff and are not discharged from service. Not to mention a nurse threatened another nurse on the floor and still works there. You can talk until your blue in the face and have documented"
bad,Constant shortcuts and unsafe practices.  Management is absentee.  Faciltiy administrators on occasion are unable to rectify problems.
bad,"Intense bullying, do not care about employees families, management turns a blind eye to improper actions of other employees. Was treated very poorly and bullied by other employees and nothing was done. Had to threaten to call HR several times. Management did nothing when complaints were taken to them. Was cussed at and insulted by other employees multiple times. The environment in general was very hostile and made me not want to go to work at all."
bad,"full of politics"
bad,"worst job I've had in 40 yrs of nursing.  over worked, underpaid, no help from chronic center.... administrator doesn't help at all"
bad,"I found that the IT department was poorly led, with far too many directors to present a clear vision and not enough 'working' people to support the company."
bad,Should have liability insurance as a Registered Nurse because the Patient Care Technicians have only a few months of training and call all the shots.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"A typical work day starts at 5 am, sometimes 4am if your unlucky enough to have to open for the day. Depending on what clinic you work at, you have to fill and lift 20 lb jugs with messy bicarbonate and acid mixtures, set up machines, start patients on dialysis, monitoring up to 10 pts at a time every 15 minutes continuously throughout your 13 hr shift with little to no downtime, which in turn, gives you no time at all to really get to know your patients. The nurse and tech to patient ratio is frightening. The patients are treated like they are on an assembly line---get em in and on and get em out with little regard for real nursing care....simply no time, is how it is. Management is absolutely unfair and displays of favoritism is a given. The cartoon characters the company uses for teaching is demeaning, in my opinion. The patients and employees are all adults, why would Davita think using child-like cartoon characters is ok is beyond me. The ""Village"" is nowhere I would ever want to be again, not in this region anyway. Patients=cattle and employees=dogs.... no, dogs are treated better."
bad,"The supervisor was hired from ""target corporation"" no medical background fired many employees before and after me!"
bad,N/a manager that was working in the Edison facility fired me because she was having relations with a friend of mine. The manager was jealous because he would call and talk to me before her .. never work with a manager that have relations with a friend!!!
bad,"Wierd, dont drink the juice.  Very cult like.  Management just wants you to be robots. Shut up and work quicker.  It's all about numbers, meet them or leave."
bad,"The management has no concern for the patients or the staff. At times the roaches outnumber the patients and supplies where so limited, you would have to cancel some patients or fight for supplies. Communication was always an issue and if you were not a “favorite” expect a very minimal paycheck. Not a place to stay for long term growth or goals."
bad,"Not the best place to work if you have a family. As a PCT, it is a lot of work for little pay. Management does not listen to employees when it comes to what we need to perform our jobs safely while providing patient care."
bad,I Would not recommend anybody to work here. They are misleading and they don't care about patients safety. Only care about budget! They have great benefits
bad,"Two stars for compensation/benefits because the benefits were great for me. The pay was insulting. You're lucky to get a 1% raise. Management is the most unprofessional group I have ever worked with. It's like being in high school with the mean girls in charge. It's as if they are ""playing office"".  They play favorites to those who make constant mistakes and don't know what they are doing.  The ones who work hard get picked on"
bad,"Not consistent across staff"
bad,Central coast in California is run by family members who will fire employees to advance their family careers. Was employed for four years and was replaced by the facility administrators niece in law. The facility administrators niece is her secretary.
bad,I have been here 3 1/2 years and I have had 5 managers. If that’s not a red flag I’m not sure what is. When you work hard they want you to work harder and faster. It’s all about the money for the big people. They just caca on you any and every chance they can get. Your nurses on the floor don’t back up the rules that have been put in place and many nurses don’t allow for patients to AMA out and make the techs look bad. I could literally go on and on about how bad this company is. Cut your losses. Don’t do it.
bad,"It was the best job I ever had when I started and the worst job when I left. After new president, there were waves of lay-offs after TM's were promised that their jobs were safe. Mass voluntary exodus of good employees occurred after new president. The morale was dismal. Company and culture was a shell of its former glory. Company was sold and permanently closed its doors December 2018."
bad,Horrible place to work. Everybody is cut throat and dirty. Managers talk to you crazy. People services is WORTHLESS! Teammate relations is worthless too! I literally felt like throwing up everyday I worked there . Don’t waste your time. You will be angry everyday . A lot of favoritism there . DaVita is despicable!
bad,"DaVita is the Walmart of the healthcare industry. They cut hours for direct care nurses and techs while over-hiring mid-management. Consistency in care is a joke--it looks different clinic to clinic because they are so bad with quality control, training, and rolling out new initiatives. This is one of the most hierarchical places I've ever worked. They keep adding layers of management to deal with ineptitude. It's a whole lot of white guys that have never worked anywhere else (and wouldn't be ""successful"" anywhere else) or seen what a functional company looks like."
bad,"It's every man for themself. Coworkers are backstabbers/crabs in a barrel and complete know it alls. Management is awful;  just as messy as the employees.  No one has your back.  You're supposed to work every other weekend,  but you get one weekend a month to yourself.  Even your superiors are a part of the 'cliques'"
bad,It’s an every man for himself work environment. Felt like working with a bunch of know it alls. Training is not sufficient vs classroom training. Classroom training was a waste of time. We did not have a good instructor. I felt like I learned more from hands on training at the job site. The pay grade is ridiculously low for the work you do. You can not survive on it. They make promises they don’t keep.
bad,"The overall experience was not a good one, perhaps if management was skilled, honest & most importantly professional it would have been a better work environment . They showed alot of favoritism & didn't have the staff or patients best interest at heart. Instead of welcoming constructive criticism to better the facilty they turned it into something negative.  The AA/CCHT was stealing time and talking about upper management behind their backs. She was also taking money and gifts from the patients."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Management is constantly changing, most managers are either too distant to help when you need their help, or micromanage absolutely everything, nothing in between."
bad,"Maybe it was just my center. No teamwork. CNAs cussing nurses on the floor in front of patients. Favorites are picked by MGMT, if you aren't one, your life is bad. Loved the pts."
bad,"I’ve been with this company for a long I recently moved to a new clinic.  My boss was mad that I was unable to work because of my son, I gave him a months notice.  When I came to work the next day my coworkers told me he said I was going to fired to a patient out loud for the entire clinic to here.  I was upset all day mostly of the pure unprofessional and lack of respect for me and my privacy, not only that but the patient and health care worker boundaries."
bad,Too many errors being seen daily that aren't corrected and endanger the lives of the patients. Numbers matter more than patients. Weak administration. Told many perks upon being hired that are not true or honored.
bad,Just don’t even do it. If you want to work with a company that doesn’t follow guild lines and feeds you nothing but garbage  in how they are a “Village” or that treats you like garbage if you are ill. They don’t like you to move further with an education. You work well over 40 hours and if you don’t you get in trouble. This is by far the worst job I held. Although I loved my patients the organization as a whole is terrible
bad,The only positive experience about working for Davita was helping the patients get better. Their training method was horrible. I was trained with about 5 different people and management didn’t seem to care. They call it the STAR method.
bad,The trainers do not train you properly. Because you are not trained properly and go to management  you are written up.   They play favoritism bith management and tour so called peers will talk about your work instead of helping you.  Very hostile work environment
bad,"You are brought into “community first company second” nonsense. RUN. Mangament is terrible because they are focused on numbers and revenue rather then patients AND the poor suckers that break their backs getting them there. There is a lot of frou frou ie happy hours, work from home (big lie because you have to break your back to get there) and an in house cafe. BUT if you don’t show upper management you’re ready to flirt you’re way up, lie, cheat or basically be a teachers pet- good luck to you. Admissions has by far the worst turn over because management is the worst. One for all all for one (don’t believe it)"
bad,"Management (previous manager) was good until the new one took over who is a Dietitian and was not very familiar with the floor work environment. I'm not saying a dietitian is not capable of understanding the work environment but you would think this one would try and learn.   Not favoring any other FA's in other clinics nor my previous FA.  DaVita needs to recognize us tech workers as well as management. Best believe you will not have that with DaVita.  They can improve on training as well, not only technicians but also management.  The manager I had, wrote me up because she did not want me to leave her clinic, so I was put on hold for 2 months. On top of it all, she was slandering the other regional manager that I was going to transfer to, telling me I was not going to like her for the way she was.  She fired me for miscommunication even when my shift was covered.  They never gave me my pto $3,000 worth.  Recently I heard one of the other technicians collected money from a patient, and this technician is still there today.   Be careful with managers such as this one.  Other than that every time I covered for other clinics was great, for someone who is covering I did not have problems.  The corporate side, I'm not a big fan of. They WILL side on the management if push comes to shove.  Be careful and good luck."
bad,"The Davita clinic I work for is a place where it is very obvious that some government regulations are ignored to save money. A clinic that services a pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients population. It has routinely, over the past 10 years, break the laws of our government; laws meant to protect all patients."
bad,"I came into Davita thinking it was going to be a great opportunity, and if could have been but I was treated so poorly by my coworkers every day. Apparently they are not kind to people who are learning and new. I saw 4 different PCT’s leave because of the way they were treated as well. Along with the hours starting at 4:15 am and not leaving till 430 or 5 sometimes and some places have a 3rd shift which ends even later was taking a toll on my mental and physical health. I did however love the actual job and I loved my patients, they are the ones who kept me going for as long as I could take. One nurse would even follow me around pointing out everything I did wrong and basically stated she was harassing me. So No I would not recommend Davita to my worst enemy."
bad,"Not a fun place to work. The company cares more about the budget, and outcomes, than the patients and staff. They make the teammates feel like we are replaceable and unappreciated."
bad,"Davita in Arkansas was probably the worst job I ever had. I was there for 2 and a half years before I finally decided to quit. The turnover was high within management and techs. I had 6 supervisors during my time there. High stressed environment. Aside from the PA's the MSW has the highest degree; therefore the MSW is expected to know and do everything. DaVita's managment will make a promise and not follow up for example: What is promised in your interview (bonuses, flexibility, clinic location etc.) WILL NOT HAPPEN!! Everyone kept saying only the APEX/ Kraken region is bad and not all are the same."
bad,"Worst company I’ve ever worked for, worst management they are clueless and all about how much money the company can bring in. "
bad,"There is no accountability, management is lacking and enables poor behavior.Lack of quality patient care due to frequent call outs,w/ no repercussions"
bad,"In 20 years in IT, this was the most poorly managed company I’ve worked for.  Management is unethical, and dishonest. They can’t even manage to put together an org chart, the dysfunction is deep and starts at the highest level of mgmt. "
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,Short-Staffed. This company is unable to retain nurses. It is only a matter of time before it goes out of business. They lack management and leadership qualities. Work their nurses to death. Have no concern for patient safety. They were unwilling to work with my schedule. Im still very surprised that this company is in business and Jhaco hasnt crushed it yet. They worry more about productivity. I have no desire to work for Davita ever again. Take your family to Fresenius for Dialysis. I would have not given it even one star.
bad,"Davita is a company that provides assembly line dialysis as all big dialysis companies do."
bad,The job was very stressful. The co worker was over worked and that tended to make them very mean and angry. They worked 12 to 16 hours  a day. The pay was horrible as well.
bad,Do not live up to their core values. Management is unprofessional and micro managed.  Very unappreciative of commentment and hard work. Integrity is a huge flaw.
bad,If you were not in management you were treated like you were not good enough to be acknowledge. Management was the worst. I had one good manager in Davita and he quiet.
bad,"The people you will work with here are people who have never worked in an office before.  Their previous jobs were at Burger King and Starbucks.  That is the caliber of the workforce..... with that being said the management is of the same caliber.  "
bad,"The company's benefits are a joke. ZERO matching on the 401K... What kind of company doesn't want to help their employees save for retirement?"
bad,Very difficult place to work in when you have cronyism. Maybe not in other clinics. Very disappointing. Not use to this type of behavior. Miss working with open approachable non-biased people.
bad,"Never go here to work, turn around and run! The management is so poor and you will never feel like you are a part of anything!"
bad,I used to enjoy working here. Leadership is poor and resources provided to do your job are not available. Poor team work and no team building. Training of Nurses is Very poor within my particular clinic and I have not seen enough person accountability from our nurses. I enjoy working independently and thrive working with a team.  This experience has been very difficult and unfulfilling.
bad,"I was once an acute employee and now that I work in a reputable hospital I just realize how DaVita rob me of my time, energy, my dedication to my work. The turn over is fast ! Once I have my first treatment in San Francisco & my 2nd treatment is in Sta. Clara which is like 50 miles away from where my first case was. The scheduler are so pushy to the RNs. It's a terrible place to work. I am so glad I am out of that total chaos! Patient safety is at stake & I am still surprise upto this day that some of the hospitals with endless complains is still clinging on to Davita. I have trained a lot of new graduate nurses and in just a few months on their own they quit ! And I began pouring out my frustration to the management and all they could comment is "" it's been like this since you came"" and so I have decided to leave. The management is all about NUMBERS !!! And profit. No wonder they have a lot of lawsuit. I just hope that a governing body would step in and summon Davita that the way they manage this company is greatly affecting patient's safety and RNs safety. To all of those RN who are still with Davita may the force be with you & God bless you."
bad,"Poor culture, does not cultivate team work. Coworkers are angry. It is not required for the clinic manager to be a registered nurse or know anything about the health field. Poor training program, bad pay."
bad,"I was bullied just about every day. I enjoyed working for Davita until i transferred to a clinic closer to home. The employees made it clear that i was VERY unwanted. No matter what i did, nothing was good enough for the nurses. They used their advantages to make me look like a horrible worker to the Facility Administrator. I gave this job my all and got absolutely no respect. I would never recommend Davita to anyone."
bad,"Bald faced lieing, unprofessional management, here in Oklahoma! They are a JOKE! Total embarrassment to the world of Healthcare!!!"
bad,"Davita wants their people to make Davita their religious cult. They use the patients needs as an excuse to coerce you in to making everything else in your life come second. There has to be more to life than work. I was terminated by this company because I no longer could maintain a balance between my work obligations and my personal obligations.( Have a life). In my job searching I avoid applying to companies that are fortune 500 and talk of "" fast paced work environment"" I work to live . I don't live to work."
bad,"They don't care about you at all. They only want a body. Leadership is inexperienced on all levels and the pay is extremely low. No pay raises. Opportunities for advancement are limited. FA's careers are dead in the water. The work hours are very long and when you need time off, they deduct it from your Paid Time Off. So there is no separate time set  aside  for ""sick leave"" or holiday hours. THIS IS A CULT. Many of the techs are lazy and unprofessional. I highly recommend anyone considering this company to look elsewhere for employment. Patient load is too heavy for the nurses to give professional care these sick patients deserve. DO NOT PUT YOUR LICENSE ON THE LINE WITH DAVITA! They talk a good game but actually don't care because most are not nurses....they can't operate without you but only want to give you pennies and not listen to your concerns when verbalized. Glad I left this horrific job for a much better one that cares and pay more."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Company has no clue, that they are paying a person to manage ,who can never be found, The manager has no concern for patients or employees . Working 15 hr work days with no breaks and unable to see your family for any special events, leaves a person tired and feeling burned out.Manager instructs you to do one thing and then lies about it. I feel sorry for the people who are still in that rat race, let go there are much better jobs,you can work hard be productive and have a life They will tell you they cant keep staff .. RUN FROM THIS JOB !!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,Davita only cares about profits. They will constantly ask you to tighten your belts while the company officers give themselves bonuses and raises. Understand that they will work you to death. I worked there for eleven years and got over 34 ataboys with  certificate and the whole nine yards. But one violation of company policy and I was show the door. So don't expect to see anything resembling loyalty on their part. The pay was middle of the road nothing special. You might be saying to yourselves that I am a disgruntled ex-employee. And you would be correct in that assumption. But that does not mean that I am not telling the truth.
bad,"I have worked for the company for a few years in both chronic and acutes. I have also worked in different cities. Sad to say it is a toxic environment. Management is a joke! The only thing they care about is $$$. Management only wants the budget kept low to have big bonuses at the expense of clinical staff and patient safety. I am an RN an they want us to work like mules!! I am the only RN, which means I have to work from open to close everyday, 14+hrs. 3 full shifts of pts with no support from office staff. FA who is not clinical so cannot help. No significant pay raises, 1-2%. The hardest part of the job is getting up and going each day. Most enjoyable has not come yet because I am still stuck here!!"
bad,"Davita is a company that provides dialysis to patients with ESRD. I personally learned a lot, too much to put down here. I loved working with patients, loved the interaction and the constant ability to teach them. I loved the PCTs (Patient Care Technician) that I worked with, and got along great with everyone I worked closely with. Management included my FA (facility administrator) and the ROD (region of Directors). They did not follow company guidelines, and provided special advances and salary to family members. This made it very difficult for myself, and my PCTS to work alongside them, and created a hostile environment."
bad,"The company says it cares about the employees, but only if you stay in line. Best for employees who like to drink the kool aid. Cult-like environment."
bad,One of the worst experiences I ever had. I was a new dialysis nurse and I was rushed off of training 4 week early. The orientation was very unorganized and I trained as a tech for two weeks before I trained with a RN. The guy in charge has no medical experience and just care about the budget. He took away night shift differential and was reason I got off orientation early. No set schedule I routinely worked 14 to 16 hour days. And they give you your schedule you have no say so how you want it set up. And I was scheduled 4 days a week. There is no balance of work and life at all.
bad,I was a PCT for two years and everytime I applied for other positions within the company I was never considered because of being a tech. I hold a bachelor's in healthcare administration but because they were afraid of me being pulled on to the treatment floor I was not able to advance my career with them.
bad,"Poor divisional leadership across the board. Unfortunately, revenue comes first instead of patient care and teammate appreciation. "
bad,"DaVita is a good company. but some employees that they hired as FA in Sacramento don't have knowledge in clinical area, don't have the qualification to be a facility administrator/manager and this FA creates animosity within teammates because of obvious favoritism. HR in this region don't support teammates grievances because all they care is to protect their FA's who are Incompetent in their job. The core values of the company are violated unlike in other regions where they uphold the company core values."
bad,The pay is not worth the job stress. The training process was awful and very unprofessional. It was the most loud and ghetto place I've  ever worked. Never should patients be exposed to such an environment. There is no teamwork! Workers sit around on their cell phones more than helping other workers.
bad,"Work atmosphere very uncomfortable.  Can't do your job, when it comes to other staff interrupting throughout the day.  Everyone seems to want to be in control, especially when the Manager is away.  Manager seems to spend more time away than in the office.  A very rude person, who once even stated she's bias.  She is not professional and should be dismissed for stating she's bias!"
bad,"FA’s play favorites. Subpar training. reported my FA to HR several times for harassment, mental, emotional & verbal abuse, the FA retaliated and HR did nothing. I had text & voice recording proof. Patients complain and nothing is done. I was told when in training only allowed to work 30 hours a week and everyone else in training worked 40.Bad bad experience."
bad,"Management was lackluster to say the least with the moral integrity of a bank robber or criminal. Laughing at how many kidney patients I had called in a particular month that had already died before getting a chance to offer them our kidney care services. Two managers even decided it would be fun to make a game out of it to see how many more calls to dead patients I could make to set a new record this particular month. Disgusting management and senior level co-workers. For the most part my other co-workers were fantastic and amazing people but the disgusting, morally bankrupt management team just plain ruined the entire experience!"
bad,"Although the benefits were very generous, that wasn’t enough to keep me with the company. Even after 19 years. The management is horrible. They are condescending and uncaring, and if you don’t conform to their way of thinking, they will make your life miserable."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,The employees dont help each other out. No team spirit! They would rather watch you drowned rather then help you. Especially the management. Very rude charge female nurse.
bad,"The first few weeks it seemed like a great place to work. But after the newness of it all faded and people started to show their true colors..I realized it was not somewhere I wanted to be. There was no teamwork whatsoever. They dont see the patients as people, just a name in a chair. Management sucked. They are anti-union. Just a very toxic place."
bad,"Poor Culture:"
bad,"Supervisors do not take your complaints seriously. HR does not like to investigate complaints. Work like you have a gun to your head! Male supervisors are allowed to terminate you for personal reasons. I worked over 70 hours a week at times. Was not allowed to take vacation time, accrued 186 hours that I did not get paid for. Supervisor was always trying to get us to work off the clock. No protection from hostile work environments. Unfair treatment is common place. Just a really horrible way to run a business. Had to file with EEOC."
bad,I left a secure job to work for Davita. I always wanted to work for this company. When given thw opportunity tbe training was horrible poor communication amongst managers and staff. They were not fair in thw disciplinary actions they took against employees. The ROD is prejudiced and a liar. They terminated me being accused of beinf threatening towards thw janitor who discarded my belongings without question and whwn asked to reimburse me for my items ahe became irate. When they interviewed her staff along with myself I was outnumbered by her staff and I had no one from my employ to witness or give an alternate account if what happened so I was canned.  With no fair chance or even an ounce of concern of the situation of how I felt nor was my items reimbursed. I was the employee accosted by a contracted worker yet I was terminated.
bad,"Dishonest communication, lulled into false sense of security, promises never followed through, low salary.  Former CEO just retired with a fat bank account.....and they “restructured” a large group of people under the pretense of finances.  Company unnecessarily spends a lot of money.  The people that were phased out received no warning, lip service, etc.....  Very disappointed in my experience with them.  NOT who they say they are."
bad,"They think they are the greatest thing since sliced bread. In fact they train you over and over again why that is so. They get you to memorize and chant slogans that supposedly reiterate that. They call doing that fun. I called it humiliating and cult-like. Do they live up to their slogans? I would say not. But others would disagree with me."
bad,Davita is a very stressful place to work at. It feels like we are at a factory getting the patients in and out. I don’t feel management cares about safety of the patients. Management are very rude and talk to the patients like a children.I do not recommend this facility to anyone
bad,Davita  corporate office is located in Irvine CA. Had good flexible schedule. But definitely stressful positions and be prepare to work your life away
bad,"I worked as an Acute RN in St.louis. I learned a lot and worked with many wonderful nurses. The best part was time with the patients. They have great benefits, and good wages. Their core values sound wonderful, however management makes it evident that they are merely words. One manager screams at everyone, and treats only a select few with respect. The clinical coordinator that I worked under talked badly about everyone, and did this in front of patients. The culture was miserable. Watch out, they will tell you that they try to keep your hours around 12 a day. That was so rare that it seemed like a gift when it happened. Expect 18-22 hour shifts regularly, they have stated repeatedly that they can work you up to 24 hours in a shift if there is patient need (there is always patient need). After a 24 hour shift you’re still expected at your next shift ( if scheduled the next day) 8 hours from the time you clock out. The reason for the long hours is because they can’t keep nurses. They told me that the turn over was high was because “dialysis is not for everyone “. I watched numerous nurses leave Davita and all of them said they enjoyed the job. All of them stated it was due to the culture, the hours, and the way they were treated. Every dialysis travel nurse that I worked with was shocked and told me that they had never seen anything like it. The money is not worth being miserable. I would strongly discourage anyone from working here however, I have heard that the chronic units in Davita  are a good place to work."
bad,"At face value DaVita seems like it would be a great place to work and they go a long way to frame it as such.  However, if you start paying attention to the routine $100M+ lawsuits routinely filed against them for defrauding the government/taxpayers, killing their patients using recalled drugs, multiple employee lawsuits for unpaid overtime and their slight of hand funding of American Kidney Care ""charity"" to funnel Medicare/caid patients to highly lucrative private insurance plans, you'll recognize the ruse the ""DaVita Way"" is really.  "
bad,"Poor management in the location I worked at, poor employee motivation, other co-workers alway compelling, not friendly felt they just came in to get their work day over with."
bad,When asking for help- will be written up. Expected to do what ever it takes to make money not a care for the patients. Less nurses and more patients = unsafe environment.
bad,"Davita speaks of comradery and team and employee support. Their motto and guiding principles all sound great, but the reality within the facility couldn't be farther from everything they claim to stand for. the patients are mostly great, and their initiatives always come from a good place. but their concepts and their reality never align. the constant addition of new tasks and new initiatives take away from patient care. and the push for the business to make money often contradicts their stated goal of quality patient care. the team is not a team, and constantly fighting against each other and arguing role and responsibility. roles are not clearly defined and therefore each new initiative becomes a new facility fight as to who is the appropriate party to be tasked with handling the responsibility of the additional work. FA's (boss) are hired with no management experience, and often don't know how to alleviate the tension amongst the team. the level of day to day stress and hostility is not worth the pay or the workload. and don't expect much appreciate or upward movement, because neither exist. each new title is simply that, a title added to your name without additional pay. maybe a small 'spot bonus' of a couple hundred bucks at the end of the year."
bad,"The culture at Davita is one of micromanagement, lack of communication and support. The business model should be ""Save lives as long as it is in the budget with as little training as possible""."
bad,"Working for Davita was fun and challenging at the same time. I had to work long hours with a last minute notice. It was hard on me and my family because I wasn't home with my kids a lot. The overtime is what made the pay good, but starting pay for technicians was very low. I loved the quarterly bonuses and the friendly staff. The management really didn't care about the staff or the patients. They didn't take time out to see about anyone needs but their own. Only wanted to meet certain deadlines that would affect their job performance."
bad,The hardest part of this job is that DaVita Metro East is understaffed daily and its an unsafe place to work. Management at this location lacks communication and staff support. The worst place I have ever worked. Davita has a great plan on paper unfortunately it's not followed at this clinic site.
bad,"This facility is highly focused in business aspect rather than patient or staff needs They hire new grads and eat them alive. Staff is at bear minimum, little is put into facility maintenance and appearance. They send people to the board to up the true . A new nurse will not recognize it coming."
bad,"The mgmt team is a joke and the pay is terrible. The benefits are awful too. They spend all their money on things like recess where you can jump rope or play vollyball and eat candy then they do paying their employees enough to survive on. Also, they keep poor management no matter how many mistakes they make or complaints they get."
bad,"I was a dialysis trainee and learned how to become a dialysis technician.  The best part of my job was learning how to do dialysis, and learning about my own body and how to take better care of my kidneys.  I also learned enough about it to go on being a dialysis technician at other facilities, taking on training roles, and becoming a resource to both new employees and patients alike.  At this time, my working environment was very, very hostile, and we needed conflict resolution techniques to be implemented very badly from management on down.  Management was very hostile with staff, and it was reciprocated as a result.  My coworkers were hard to get along with and very undereducated about dialysis procedures, which eventually led to improper care of most of our patients.  The environment was not as caring as it should have been at the time I was there.  That indeed was the hardest part about working there, just trying to maintain a positive working environment."
bad,They have a super high turn over rate due to poor treatment of employee's
bad,"There is alot of unnecessary hype surrounding this up and coming company. Unfortunately, because i was so desperate to find a job I bought into what many other reviewers and the company's website said. Let me break down the major pros and cons that others may not have told you about so that you're fully informed before you accept the position. "
bad,"Management says they have an open door policy, but most of them are unapproachable and rude. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers. They are truly a great group that are not treated very well or appreciated. I think management should be encouraging, not there to knock you down and that is the way if feels there."
bad,"You are expected to work nonstop. You are not treated or respected as a nurse.  LVN’s are treated as a pct with significantly more work for little pay. They allow the RN treat people as if they are nothing. The RN is allowed to yell at staff in front of patients with no consequences. LVN’s are expected to do everything, including opening/closing, mixing bicarbonate, CVC’s, cannulations, giving meds with no support while all other staff, including the charge nurse, sit around and talk or play on cell phones. Leaving the patients to suffer."
bad,"My Experience has been horrible.  I was hired Nov. 2019 and by January, HR had to get evolved, the culture sounds nice but I honestly can not say I have experience what they preach."
bad,"Wonderful opportunity for Registered Nurses to join our Management Registry, Inc. team! You will be responsible for delivering high quality care to assigned patients."
bad,"For the most part the staff were knowledgeable, friendly, and very hard working. Unfortunately given the companies push to get patients on and off dialysis quickly it was difficult to follow procedure. If an employee took to long between patients they were told they had poor time management. To avoid getting into trouble I witnessed many, many staff members cut corners and not adhere to guidelines. Things like taking blood pressure correctly and weighing before starting, using proper technique when accessing grafts, and manipulating the dialysis machine to pull more fluid faster than doctors orders. I don’t think the staff was lazy, just trying to keep up with an impossible schedule (and very often irresponsible and belligerent patients )"
bad,"If you don't mind jeopardizing your license by being the only RN with 16+ patients on the floor because no clinic can keep staffed, this is the company for you. "
bad,Boss pays friends more than  new non friend worker. Racially motivated pay scale . Colored employees  get payed $1-2 less than non colored workers. Bosses friend  reports on all colored  employees to boss daily.
bad,They make big promises! Hire you for a job then once you're trained you have to commute a long distance in order to get any hours. No flexibility in scheduling at all.
bad,"If you like having to get agreement from everyone whether they are directly affected by your position or not, then this job is for you. If you don't mind going on leave and coming back to no job, then this job is for you."
bad,"This was the most toxic work relationship I’ve ever experienced in healthcare. The majority of leadership/admin have NO experience in a healthcare setting. Patients are treated like ‘widgets’ Davita is focused on productivity and chair turnaround, more than patient care and safety. The RN to patient ratios are as high as 1/18, which is not safe for patient care. On a typical shift RNs will be responsible for 12-18 patients and have 2-4 techs working under their license. The promised training is subpar. Protect your licenses fellow nurses! They have a significant RN and Support Staff retention issue and expect 50% of new recruits to leave."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Poor upper management. My boss isn't receptive to hearing anything I have to say. The company is more focused on the bottom line than they are on the employees or patients. I love the patients I work with, and some of my coworkers are great to work with. The hours are long and exhausting. Very stressful job, especially when the low pay is taken into consideration."
bad,"I’ve been working in dialysis for 11 years, I do truly love my job but it’s starting to get very frustrating when my boss is not even a leader all she is is a boss. To her the patients and staff are all just numbers. Not just myself but other teammates have caught her in several malicious lies, she’s so dishonest it’s almost scary."
bad,"This was the worst place I have ever worked at in my 18 yrs as a RN. I was there for 1 month. I had a horrible trainer and was 3 weeks behind from others that started at the same time I did. I then had to ask to be switched trainers and the new PCT was so busy doing everything I had no clue about that I still never got to the basics. I quit after 1 month noticing how the staff to patient ratio was since they were always understaffed and running around. The patient was just a chair time with minimal interaction since they were busy. Nurses would do assessments with minimal interaction. The nurse role I saw was giving meds and doing the PCT role. Also if you need health insurance when you work there you will not get it for 2 to 3 months depending on when you start, so figure out that in advance. My administer was friendly and accommodating."
bad,Long hours with out heads up a lot of turn around people walk in and walk out of this job. Management turn around no stability so new management has no answers to your questions. Lied about Christmas bonus
bad,"A lot of complaining co-workers, in time I realized that it wasn't just talk. The core values are just something to say. C.Y.A. is the most important thing you can do for yourself at this company. Get the paycheck, experience and get out."
bad,"Do not apply for new training program. They say they train you for 12 weeks. 4 weeks are book work. You luck if you get a good preceptor. They will not let you do canulation on patients. Preceptors are mean and so are staff.  I wish I never wasted my 4 months at davita. run fast they have high turn over rate. Pay check doesnt reflect on all the work you do. They want you to come in at 3am due to being short staff. Then you work from 3am to 530pm. They want you to work 5 days out of 6 days weekly.  On your feet the whole time! Do not apply your license will be on the line. They treat patients as a factory. They want you to put people on in 15 minutes. Assessments, cannulation of the fistula and hooking them to the machine. The machine alone is over 50 steps! Its unsafe to place patients on that quickly."
bad,"Company culture is all about making money at any rate, even breaking the law and being unethical to patients. Lack of adequate staffing to care for patients at the end of the day. making insane requests of staff to ensure the quotes for the FA to get her bonus."
bad,Poor direct management ruins everything.   Seems Davita doesn’t hire experienced managers or train them in coaching and counseling. It’s better to have no FA then one that creates a hostile environment and has little to  no experience.
bad,"This was probably the worst job I've ever had. The environment/culture at Davita Rx is very toxic. The company hires a lot of young millenials who treat the place like it's high school all over again. Gossip flourishes at this place between teammates. I was on a team where there was constant conflict among team members. The training I received was subpar. The trainer for my department seemed as though she wasn't qualified to train anyone as she did not know the processes herself. I had to open 7-8 different programs just to call a patient about a medication as each program has different data in it that tells you things about the patient that might be useful while on the phone with them. Also, you don't need a whole lot of pharmacy skills at this place, although it is helpful if you and your teammates know the general idea of how a pharmacy works, i.e.--->inusrance adjudication, how certain phone converstations are supposed to go when reaching out to patients, pharmacist consultations, perscription processing, inbound/outbound transfers of medications, etc. The processes and software Davita Rx uses is extremely outdated and archaic. It is a call center and does get very boring. I spent all day on the phone with patients, sitting at a desk. I came from a busy retail chain store, so the sitting down was a nice change of pace, but quickly got old. If you are wondering about the management, the management in my department was not great. I was with this company for a year and saw a turnover of 4 managers within my team. This job was extremely easy and does not require a high skill"
bad,The place was ran by the employee's and they didn't respect management. You had to constantly give staff stuff in order for them to do their job. Long hours and the patients are difficult.
bad,"I've worked in dialysis for 8 years, Davita is by far the worst company I've ever worked for including jobs that aren't related to dialysis. Management has no idea what's going on and forces you to work short staffed on a daily basis. In fact they purposefully schedule their employees that way to save money, which is dangerous and unethical. The pay is terrible especially when you consider what the job entails. The best part about it is the relationships you gain with your patients. Depending on the clinic your in, most techs and nurses have an ""eat thier young"" kind of attitude that definitely makes it difficult for an inexperienced new employee. I no longer work in dialysis but if your interested in starting, I would go with Fresenius."
bad,"If you looking for growth, the only growth is to move from one department to another. Management tends to look out for there own, there is a lot favoritism here. "
bad,"bad and unsafe company model,  DaVita is all about numbers and bonus for upper management. This health care company is unconcerned with the health and well being of it's working employees."
bad,"Retention rate is high, overworked, Could offer better pay and stable management. staff feels unappreciated, hours are extremely early, hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day"
bad,great experience taking care of chronic diaysis patients.   the work was fast paced and hard most days due to having to work during 3 turns on the clinic floor.  was not enough time allotted between turns so made for hectic days most of the time but i didnt mind the hard work.  I love learning a specified nursing skill that hopefully will serve me well for future job needs.
bad,"Staffing ratio does not allow for competent care of patients per the required policy and procedures. Complacent care in the efforts of ""getting the job done"". Corners are cut to spare the bottom line. I would not refer a patient to this organization."
bad,"Facility Administrator FA and your Clinical Coordinator CC are either not there are don't care.  Favoritism is big here. Technicians run the floor. Bullying and harassment take place in the work floor. Your clinical coordinator CC should be present but if like my clinic was absent all the time ( health issues) however she still got paid. If you are not an RN maybe a LVN or a Tech you can expect to work extremely hard.   I'm not joking. Long hours and low pay. Dialysis is ""heard them in heard them out."" "
bad,"It was an amazing opportunity! Unfortunately, the staff call off ratio was horrible which left those of us who showed up to work stuck staying and covering multiple times!  And management refused to do anything about it."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,It is very unprofessional and mismanaged . If you are not used to working hard and swift then this not the job for you. If you are coming in fresh to Dialysis it is a big challenge.
bad,Beware of employment at the westminster location. They do not welcome new employees and will talk about you and treat you poorly to the patient's. This is the entire staff (males & females). Patient's will not trust you because they will degrade you to the patients. Beware. That is all I have to say.
bad,"Management along with RN had bad attitude! Poor company to work for. No lunches, over worked! They dont care about family. Work you like a dog"
bad,After training at central. They moved me to the North side to work. Co workers were rude and told me I didn't fit there. They were losing their over time with me there and ran me out with lies. Plus the head Nurse over the sight lacks management skills. It is funny how I did great in training and then all of a sudden I didn't know what I was doing.  2012
bad,"Job is too stressful not enough time in between patients. Patients are in and out like cattle horrible. Had to leave before I lost my licenses I worked hard for. High rate of turn over with nurses, techs, and management! No room for advancement not least you are in the CLICK guess I wasn't around long enough to get invited into the CLICK. I would had decline away. Extremely to much Nepotism with the company!"
bad,"DaVita is a great company who is proud of its patients and their culture. Sadly, DaVita Labs in DeLand, FL does not well represent DaVita, headquartered in Denver, CO. The management of DaVita Labs is being constantly replaced and they can't seem to find the right one. We are talking about an amazing talent being let go. The current core management works from home 90% of the time, and they don't really seem too involved what is going on at the Lab. Human Resources department is probably the weakest department of the organization where employees can't seek any advise, guidance or support. There is no chance for advancement, promotion in this facility. Lab workers do not feel appreciated, the wages are extremely low, the turnaround in this company is extremely high. I do not recommend working there. When you relocate from another state to work for DaVita Labs, DeLand, FL, I truly recommend not to buy a home as your job may only last a year or so. It's too unstable to work over there."
bad,"I initially enjoyed my job with Davita, I thought I would be there for a long time. They cannot keep management there, the technicians were practically running the place. Although they give you the opportunity to move within the company, I would make sure you know all of the specifics of your new position. I changed  to a position that I found out after the fact I would not recieve any training for, so I had to learn things as I was told to do them. I was also held in the position I tried to leave, because no one wanted that job so I was made to work 6 days /week and up to 10-12 hours /day. They also rented me out to other facilities and I still had to come back and work at my own facility"
bad,"My day started at 6am and I never knew when I would go home. We were horribly understaffed, and my FA had unrealistic expectations. I was also given a ""punishment"" for not coming in when called one afternoon...on my day off. The call was rediculous, and even if I was on call from 6am Saturday-6a Monday, and got called out on a Sunday until 5am, I was expected to work the whole following day. I was lied to about call pay(no mileage like I had been told), and no weekend, night time, or holiday pay. It was a great learning experience but other than that it was the worst job I have ever had. And if you do resign, even with a MONTH notification, don't expect a good reference for future jobs."
bad,DaVita loves only money. They don't care about patients and really treat staff poorly. Only work for them if you are desperate and until you can find something better!
bad,Management had no sense of direction and would yell quite often to get her point across. The people I worked with were great and always very helpful. I'm happy to have moved on. I would not recommend being a contractor there.
bad,"How a job perceives itself on paper , is totally different once you work there. I'm sorry patients have to suffer at the hands of uncaring staff,, when situations are brought to their attention"
bad,"They allow the PCT's to run the show, adjust the machines bolus the patients everything , the Nurses need to increased by at lease one so that the pt can be better assessed before being bolused and watched more closely afterward .Crash cart for looks only  not allowed to use at this branch. Training poorly executed. Dialyzers are cleaned and sanitized and everyone does follow protocol carefully about sterility. Longevity of staff, so patients receive continuity of care.  They just need to make a little room for a newbie and cover the holes in their safety practices and  GET RID OF THE BACK BITING TO THE PATIENTS, They do really hustle to get the patients in on time so they aren't there any longer than they have to be."
bad,Great depending on which department you work in. I worked there for two years I was never going to be promoted. Supervisor was awful and they did nothing to chg it after several complaints. Deadlines are way to tight and it’s almost impossible to make them. They give you more and more work and never change the deadlines. Meetings at least three times week and long and unnecessary. Keep looking DaVita doesn’t pay what you are worth.  lmeeting.
bad,"Management are liars! Pay is below standard. Overworked.  Underpaid! Terrible leadership. There is Fun, I  give them that. If only they treated you with caring and respect."
bad,Was not the best company I've worked for. Training is suppose to be a few months but techs are put with patients on our own to early. Davita takes to many chances with un-trained techs working on patients by themselves.
bad,This place was not an enjoyable place of employment. There was no structure and a huge lack in leadership. The culture was no followed through by each department and the disconnect was very apparent.
bad,They don't pay their techs enough and they are always understaffed.  There are not laws in Colorado about patient/staff ratio and they take full advantage of this.
bad,"DaVIta Rx used to be a fun place to work, but new management was brought in and have destroyed the company. It is stressful, cut-throat and not worth the pay. Mass layoffs are happening and I expect the company will be sold or shut down soon."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"The best part about this job is interacting with the patients, including educating them and their families.  Davita overall is probably a good place to work,  but the Las Cruces  location was terrible! Management allowed childish, unprofessional behavior to occur,  even after being told what was happening to certain staff members !!!"
bad,"Davita has continually scheduled me with bare bone staffing. Conditions are unsafe for patients. Any issue that I bring to light is ignored. I have worked at several locations thinking I could find stability, but never did. "
bad,"The culture around DaVita is like an occult.  People cited the core values at least once per day, paid poorly, and unfairly treated.  The acquisition of our company took over 18 months, which during this time we were told various things (i.e. none of us would lose our jobs, we were all safe, etc)."
bad,"Typical day is 12+hrs, high stress level, and chaotic. Clinic in Ybor is poorly managed and disorganized. Culture of DaVita includes a lot of gossip, cut throat behavior."
bad,All the culture rumors you hear about DaVita are true. The company was overly concerned about telling people how great it was. Employees were forced to promote a culture they didn't believe in.
bad,I worked for the Lancaster facility for a year and never have I been more disgusted with the lack of professionalism from management. I reported a nurse and PCT for mistreating a patient and wAs retaliated against for months after with management doing nothing. The clinical coordinater at the king street facility talked negatively about staff and patients. The turn over for this particular facility is so high yet nothing is done. When I tried to transfer the FA wrote me up for something trivial because if your written up you can't transfer for 6 months. Not all facilities are like this but the king street facility in Lancaster has a very bad reputation and have been through so many nurses and PCTs yet nothing is done.
bad,"DaVita Labs is not a company to work for if you're looking for a career. The turn over rate is like none I have ever seen in a company. They do not value talent! It is all about who you know in the company. Most of the supervisors, managers and senior management team all know each other. They only promote teammates if your in their click not based on job performance. Over the last several years I have watched new management come on board and clean house. The General Manager has no clue how to run the place just how to cut departments and get rid of teammates to keep the budget low. This company doesn't care about its teammates only about profit. The HR department is a joke as they are suppose to be there to help the teammates but when you talk to them they go right to management to inform them of the discussion and in return your life becomes a living HE11! I have seen the moral of the teammates change since I started several years ago. It's sad because teammates don't speak up as they're afaird of retaliation. Do yourself a favor and don't work for the Lab as you will regret it. Outside of the Lab the company is a great place to work."
bad,"This was the WORST place I have ever worked.  Coworkers were bullies who belittled me in front of patients on a daily basis.  Many shortcuts were taken at this facility.  The boss was aware and would lecture employees about not taking shortcuts, but when the boss is almost never in the office, the techs took it upon themselves to run the place. The RN was there just to ""hold the counter up"" as one patient stated.  This place was a total joke!  Absolutely unprofessional!  Unprofessional atmosphere and employees who held a constant frown on their face, unless they were gossiping about other employees or patients, which was the ONLY time they would smile and laugh.The secretary who was there to welcome you, would sit behind the glass window while talking on the phone while glaring at the patients coming in and for the ones who were there standing at the window, would just have to stand there and wait until she finished her phone call.  That is, when she wasn't in the back barking commands to employees OR out running personal errands for the boss."
bad,My first week I was thrown into a corner to 'look up' answers in three huge books! No discussion about what the job was about or what the training was. I had to hunt down the FA to see if I work the next day or not. I am so disappointed in this company. I had high hopes and now I don't want to work here
bad,"Lots of favoritism. It Is who you know, instead of what do you know. Used to be a community first company but now it is a corporate style business. Used to be really fun to work at Davita. Teammates  were so motivated and happy to be at work every day. Unfortunately, that is not the case anymore, half of the time management does not participate or motivate or encourage teammates. Must of the time is when use survey are coming so they can have a great score.  We just got an spectacular building biggest automated lab however It is very sad to see what used to make DaVita such a wonderful place to work is gone"
bad,Davita does not care about employees all they care about is that there a human body able to work.  Hiring nonqualified managers that have no medical background.  It a big negative.
bad,Management is on of the more difficult aspects of working for Davita labs. There is no work -life balance for the Teammates that are non managerial or executive management. Expect to work hard - as there is a lot to do. Merit increases are non existent.
bad,I have worked for Davita for over five years. The ONLY reason I’ve stayed as long as I have is because I care about the patients and like the flexible days/hours. Seasoned workers are treated disrespectfully and new employees come in often making more with less skill. They are clearly all about the almighty dollar and not the patient care or staff. The patients know it too. We’ve had five FA’s in the five years I’ve been there and the staff keep leaving due to treatment
bad,"You were not allowed to actually care for the patients, they wanted you to get them in and out with no interaction.   only you initial intake was the only interaction acceptable."
bad,"Call volume was extremely high, we were understaffed all around the pharmacy, random lay offs were constantly happening, they were extremely on employees about call grades but had an inconsistent grading system. overall awful work environment."
bad,"Majority of the employees I dealt with at that company were always in a very bad mood, mostly because they had other contract jobs with other dialysis companies.  You were not given ample time to really train in a particular area before you were left alone with your patients.   The hardest part of the job were the extremely long hours, quick shift changes, and dealing with the bad moods.  The most enjoyable part was getting to know the patients under your care."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"I have told anyone who will listen not to work for DaVita. Nurses, if you value your license.... stay far away. I was hired for one position but was thrown into another. Worked as CC and Charge nurse and was paid only one salary. Was taken to task if something fell behind."
bad,"I worked in cheltenham and if you read the google reviews everything they say is true. It was a headache and no one wanted to see you prosper outside of work. It is poorly ran, it is very clicheish, the fa and clinical manager are liars, that will remove you if they see fit. I currently get UC and it was determined that the FA lied about things she falsely accused me of saying to her, as well as not following protocol for the exiting process. I encourage you to not work at the cheltenham clinic just to maintain your own grounds and sense of who you are."
bad,"My manager went to university of phoenix........ nuff' said. LOL."
bad,Don't apply to this they are going thru lawsuits with govt doing illegal accounting all kinds of things it's very stressful if you speak up on things not right you can get fired
bad,"If you are not part of the management team you have no value. All it takes is one manager to not like you and your years of service, dedication and a stellar work history mean nothing."
bad,"Very hard work and fast paced with little breaks"
bad,"8 hour days to your desk "
bad,Compensation is not commensurate to the job being done. Too stressful environment to work. Not healthy place to work with.
bad,This was the worst place I have every worked.  The management is very poor.  Does not have any medical background.  Many of the co workers were not nice.  If you were not of their culture they did not talk to you and many times were very rude.
bad,This job as a lot of work too do when it come to management. The turn over wouldn't be so frequent if they got that under control
bad,"Very unprofessional, by far this is the worse job I had. So much work for little pay. Schedule is not flexible, they don’t won’t you to have a life. They act like their understanding and caring when their really not. Management is very messy!"
bad,"Relying on non-licensed personnel to manage patients with varying levels of acuity. Patients that are inappropriate for chronic outpatient being allowed to continue treatment at the facility due to profit motives. Non-clinical facility administrators creating unrealistic demands that will only set you up for failure. Administration has repeatedly acknowledged that there is currently not enough time to follow proper protocol, but they will assuredly hang you out to dry if something happens. Do not trust your license with this company. There are some incredible and hardworking people here, but the corporate direction is what makes it a horrible place to work at."
bad,I don’t recommend this job for anyone hoping for career advancement. They aren’t looking to promote someone who works hard. It’s more about your networking skills and how many things you are involved in. You are evaluated monthly by how many outstanding authorizations you have. The  goal is a 97% auth rate. I have watched people get promoted who were in the 70-80% range. If you are involved in a lot of different things then they don’t care about what your auth rate is. If you express your concerns to leadership it reflects poorly on you. They are allowed to mandate overtime so be prepared for that. Davita is very big on fun and often times the activities that take place keep you from getting your work done. The starting Pay is 14.75 and you get a 25 cent raise after you get out of training. You get a yearly evaluation with an opportunity for another raise. It’s only a few cents so don’t get too excited. As one of their top performers I can honestly tell you that you don’t get paid enough to do this job. I strongly recommend that you try to find something else first and reach out to Davita as a last resort.
bad,Expected to work 20 hours plus a day a times and be on call multiple times a week Often short staffed. Managers continuously changing. No continuity . High employee turnover rate.
bad,"High staff turnover, forced to cover more than one clinic without extra pay or mileage reimbursement. Disrespectful Indian nephrologists, no career advancement... if this is what you aspire to, then DAVITA is for you!!!"
bad,Its a good resume builder. But I wouldnt stay longer than 1-2 years. Politics there are insane and unless you are in mangement you are very replacable.
bad,A very petty work environment. Management is the worst I’ve ever experienced. It’s all about favoritism and who you know. Very controlling micromanagement rule by intimidation. And the rude level is off the charts. Very unprofessional. Management will turn on and off their route level depending who is in the facility
bad,"Typical day gets busy during turnover (initiation & termination of treatments)"
bad,"I feel that DaVita is not a equal opportunity company, I have twice to three times the experience and they don’t care . I believe that if they would go by qualifications and performance they would be a much better company"
bad,The days were long.  I did like the continuity of care.  I had a great team to work with.  My immediate manager is wonderful.  Great benefits.  I did not like starting at 4 in the morning.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"A fable and a lesson, but it is a thoroughly enjoyable one, delivered with masterful performances and a great sense of storytelling tradition....false hope"
bad,"gave me a raise and then not even a month later fire me and the raise was for their appreciation and to keep up the good work, they will smile in your face but then talk behind your back even if your the sweetest kindest person ever"
bad,"I was excited to start working here but soon was very disappointed. Work environment sucks. Management has set the bar to where patients get away with rude behavior. Some of their core values are fun and teamwork however fun is nowhere to be found and teamwork depends on who you're working with that day.  Turn over times are a joke, not enough time to do everything you are required to do without running late so patients get angry at you for either not getting them on in time or not getting them off quickly enough."
bad,"They honestly don’t care about you just what can do on the job and Pay you less than what you should be "
bad,This company was not a good work place. I found that this company as a whole breeds bullies and allows employees to be bullied and mistreated. At my unit the FA didn't run the unit the bullies ran our unit.
bad,If you do not fit in with their shenanigans they will treat you unfairly.  I love the work but not most of my co-workers.  The physicians were nice to work with as well
bad,"lack of respect to the laws. needs to be put under government (federal) review. needs strict oversight. Immediate  retraining of  all employees from managements to lower personnel due to ignorance of laws, sub-standard care to patient and their welfare. Does not follow Government regulations."
bad,"This company is very understaffed and will make you work a 22hr shift, leadership is non clinical. They do not care about your well being. Not trust worthy, will put you in situations that put your license at risk as well"
bad,Davitas core values were the best I enjoyed the patients and learned a lot from the staff member's.  Constant change of management was something I liked the least.
bad,"If you like getting paid high school money this is the place for you, my manager would micromanage and pull my calls outside of the procedures because that was the quality teams job, this took place every other day she use to probe me to try and get me to quit"
bad,"The only good thing I can say about this place is the pay is great "
bad,"Not enough training, two face employees, poor managers and leads that don’t know the job, supervisors that play favorites amongst employees and gossips with their favorites about others, management and employee cliques, write employees up for every little thing, very micromanaged. Training is terrible and you get different answers from everyone when ask one simple question. Very high turnover of employees that quit or are fired for no reasons.  Managers and supervisors move around because employees give them low marks on the many surveys, that they quickly move to other departments to not get fired. Quantity not quality is more important.  Overworked and low pay.  They lie about how great everything is in the interviews.  Davita is building a big complex in Federal Way that Tacoma will move to in about 3-4 years.  The company pays the big shots and spends on themselves, while the real workers make 15-16 bucks an hour. No raises.  You soon find out how horrible it really gets pretty quickly.  Supervisors focus on employees and micromanage them terribly to make life hard on them to either quit or be fired.  They lie and make up things as excuses to get rid of employees then fight so they can’t get unemployment.  So disappointed, bored, and sad.  Make this definitely your last resort for a job."
bad,"Patients are great, staff and managers no so much. Long hours everyday combined with be antagonized by facility employees. I'm mostly here because of the young lady who was let go in, October and lucky for me I decided to resign before things got too bad. The young lady did a fantastic job and helped everyone, sadly hey did not appreciate that or the time and effort she put in while working there. She deserves for her voice to be heard by higher up because everyone knows that what happened was unjust."
bad,I worked at Davita for 6 months and I enjoyed what I did but I did not enjoy the scheduling. The schedule was made and I found myself always left out. Others would have 40 plus hours and I would only have 20-30 hours per week and I was supposed to be full time.
bad,"working for davita has taught me a lot i love my patients and my co workers."
bad,"Worst job I ever had horrible pay and work life balance. For the amount of responsibility and bs, this job is not worth the pay. Please avoid this company like the plague!"
bad,Only take a job with Davita if it is your last option!!!!! Compensation is horrible yet everything is money driven! This is the worst job I've ever had. A typical day starts at 530AM and ends no later than 1800. I learned that you are suppose to work non stop. Some of the workers were nice but management was horrible. Please don't waste your time!!! You will not be happy.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"I've enjoyed this position. It required a lot of detailed work and it was rewarding when a job was completed. Although no one really saw the hard work in it, it was always rewarding to get things done."
bad,this is a for profit company.  My hours were manipulated so that I was not given Overtime pay.  Salaries are very low.   This company does not value RN's or their experience.  Not recommended in the Oklahoma or North Texas region.
bad,"When i join davita i do not know any thing about haemodialysis. My collegue there thouht me every thing. They were very supportive, especially my Nurse Manager"
bad,it was only for volunteer work but it was fun somewhat challenging
bad,My manager was caring and supportive. Fellow employees were great friends.
bad,They only care about the almighty doller! Not the patients.the most under handed sneeky company I have ever worked for!!!
bad,"I would not recommend working at the Corpus Christi / Coastal Bend facility due to the management style. Most employees were very unhappy with the situation, but stay because of the few jobs available in the area. I quickly left for another opportunity as my integrety and work life balance was more important the $10 an hour job. I would recommend to seriously look elsewhere for employment."
bad,"When I came to the company over 11 years ago the culture was much different , the teammates cared for each other and so did management. After about 7 years being there the old were out and the new was in and the culture of the company changed it was all about what is best for management and with the rest of you we don't care"
bad,"Too many patients, too little time.  Unsafe.  They expect you to assess and take on a pod of patients and turn over patients in 15 minutes. That is just unsafe practice.  You cannot as an RN look and assess everyone in that unit like that."
bad,"This job was very stressful, management was detached from what was going on, doctors there were unhappy. It was a very depressing work place and I found not one thing enjoyable there."
bad,"This a company to Give the employed good benefit, good bonus and management with good skill experience, opportunity to have better position and good pte care according to the guide line.Good Rating good co-worker skill.In general this is a good company to work and for pte care Tpicall day if about pte care,learn about new medicare guide line,good management,good relation with nco-worker,mice a pte for diference reason,pte satisfaction"
bad,"I set up my dialysis machines , supplies , obtain patient report,  do an assessment , review meds , consents and dialysis access site. I also travel to multiple facilities working with many specialties and nurses.  You need to be flexible and have excellent people skills.  That is also the most enjoyable part of my job . I have excellent support from my co workers  while maintaining independence and accountability."
bad,"Worked in AP over 9 years! Davita was a great company when I started in 2007. However, the last few years the department was ran by incompetent management. If you were not in with the management they found a way to get rid of you. Almost every teammate that had been there for any length of time they got rid of.. Just so they didn't have to pay then their worth. They also do not like when you speak up for yourself!"
bad,"Expected to work with one other nurse M/W/F, and T/TH alone. Acutes patient load could be from one to 10, each a three hour shift. On days when nurse was alone, she was also on call. On T/TH,  there were usually 4-6 patients, which means working 12-18 hours alone, on call, and expected to show up for work at 8 am the next morning. Management was horrible. I do NOT recommend this company to anyone who wants a life."
bad,Management is full of it!! You will be OVER WORKED and severally UNDER PAID!!  They said they OWN you it was probably a joke but I was truly offended. Don't dare call in it's already a struggle. And it's rare to find someone to cover a shift
bad,You should have good skills to start to work there and no health issues And your superior may not have no medical experience  be safe and know the job expectations
bad,"Poorly managed, it's all about the dollar. Staffing cut to unsafe conditions, employees working off the clock with managers knowledge, wages far to low for expectations, zero chance for advancement."
bad,"She is using company funds for personal use. She insulted you in front of other teammates and she would tell teammates to go to academy talking her up, terrible leader"
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"management in the Tallahassee area is horrible. They overwork you, underpay you, and expect you to stay until you're no longer needed. You're hired with the pretenses that you will have a set number of hours you want to work, but once you start working there they force you to stay if they don't have enough staff, regardless of how many hours you've worked that day."
bad,Poorly run company.  Too many top level management.  Poor opportunity to move up due to short staff and job turnover. Poor yearly raises and no bonuses.
bad,"Terrible management and staff...they hire and train people with no experience to perform very important medical procedures.  Most of the facility administrators were nice (with the exception of the last one) but really didn't have a clue on how a dialysis clinic was supposed to be ran.  "
bad,"Culture is the exact opposite of what the company stands for. Often hires under false pretenses. Will not advance based on experience only, must have a degree. Poor communication, large turnover with leadsership"
bad,"This company don't value their employees. Also, they have bad judgment of character of who should they hire to handle patient lives which makes patient safety isn't their priority."
bad,"Not able to have break for meal.  Work average day 10 hours.  No time for documentation.  Poor management. Disorganized training, without preceptors consistently."
bad,"I interviewed with a Davita in Janesville, WI.  I did not feel welcome the moment I walked in the door. Its like they didn't want me there or I was wasting their time.  I met with 2 managers and another person.  The manager at this site was not friendly borderline rude.  No one smiled.  Odd.  When asked what kind of hourly rate I was looking for I said 19.00 p/h. - The average LPN wage is over 21.00 p/h in janesville.  The manager said ""thats high.""  Its high if u are paying HS graduates that with no experience!  I was so disappointed.   I'm glad I wasn't offered a job there, it didn't seem like a good place to work.  Also the manager wasn't even a nurse and she's hiring techs and nurses- come on.  I've wanted to work for this company for a very longtime.  Sad."
bad,"The company is differently  very good company."
bad,"When starting at Davita they sell the whole team approach where you think you’re working for the greatest company ever. Unfortunately management has no clinical background nor do they care about the patients’ safety or the employees’ safety and work life balance. Very cheap company, only driven by numbers not culture. They work employees beyond their capabilities and ratio."
bad,It's like you're patients are in a fastfood place because the safety is never a concern. It's all about getting them in and out fast so that way they can sent you home. Basically cutting your hours so that the facility Administrator gets more of a bonus for saving the company money. Never caring about the patients needs.
bad,The co workers were very unprofessional. The manager was not manager material and the hours and amount of work does not match pay at all. Definitely rewarding job saving lives or help to do that.
bad,I like the hourly pay for the company is good; but Davita doesn't care about the patient technicians that work for their company. They have the attitude of it doesn't matter how long you have been working for the company or how good of a worker you are you need to continue to work no matter how tough it gets in the company or else you can be replaced. They only care for the NURSES at Davita.
bad,"Management is horrible and runs a lot of good employees away. Toxic work environment. Pay isn't very good and despite what you're promised when you start, they pick and choose who gets better pay. Even when you have lots of years of experience, you could be paid a lot less than somebody with no experience."
bad,"Poor pay, poor work life balance. Turn over is horrible. Poorly managed. The environment is very negative with a lack of empathy. The company’s only real concern is money. A lot of promises are made but nothing ever changes."
bad,RN's will do tech work very often.  Hours do vary frequently from periods of having to use PTO to supplement pay to days of no relief  (very long hours) . insurance isn't the best.  frequently understaffed.
bad,"great environment to work in. patients and Co-workers are great, the only down fall is that there is no place to grow and management is very rude and unorganized."
bad,unpredictable must be flexible to work. automony with job description and extensive training program to learn position. able to learn with no experience
bad,"Poor management, lack of flexibility, very underpaid positions, lack of organization within the company. Try to make up for short comings by having lots of ""rah rah"" events to promote a happy company, but doesn't work."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"I was a 21 year employee. I totally believed in Davita's core values and mission. It broke my heart the day I got fired. Not for myself but for the  Training Program and for the patients. I know I made a difference. "
bad,"I have many years in healthcare... First they can't keep people to work there...Gave me$13 hr ...I walked... told them I couldn't pay my mortgage with that jive... So when me and another co-worker said we were leaving because of the pay not matching out experience in healthcare... They said they'd give us a$2 raise...I asked for something in writing... He looked and said he couldn't produce something like that....I knew what it was when he said that.... Right when it was supposed to show up on our check this so-n-so quit... So they are short at greenview and make sure you smother yourself with alcohol before you go home for obvious pest reasons"
bad,"Often davita explains your ration for pct to patients is 3:1. In reality it is 4:1 and some days 5:1. Your work day is fast paced and long. With somedays clocking almost 17 hours. However, the facility administrator nearly always works 9 to 5 and never works saturdays. The patients are allowed to insult and verbaly abuse staff with little consecuence to them. Transportation of patients via transportation companies nearly 70 percent of the time bring patients late which in turn pushes the time you leave the facility further into the already long workday for little pay. Expect to be called in on your days off. And expect lack of common respect if you choose not to come in on said day off. If you need to call out for medical reasons you must do the day before and beg your co workers to cover you less you be given a written warning or possibly schedualed to speak to human resources. You may never call out the day you work. Even if vomiting, with flu, and or other medical reason. Patients, some of them with often infectious deseases often argue with staff, rip needles out of their arms, and swear at you and threaten violent. You will also find yourself on your hands(gloved) and knees(in flimsy white plastic coat) cleaning up blood spills from either poor canulation unruly patient or bleeding after treatment. You must have your name on your flimsy plactic coat while the aor is conditioned to 72+ degrees so patients know exactly who to complain about. All in all i would never want to work their again and if you are hired ...may whomever you believe in have mercy on you because davita"
bad,We don’t have enough time do set up for patients. The machines were hard to use. They have poor management there and can be very rude. Always have misunderstandings.
bad,"It is not best place to work. Management is not great and pts do what they want and at times are very aggressive and impropriate . Not safe to work, you have pt overload for techs."
bad,"Lack of cultural diversity. Lack of advancements. TOO many frequent changes. Majority staff are Asians, they speak their language especially when they are wrong. Unfortunately, management is always Asian as well so you go figure."
bad,"Was given a problem about taking doctors appointments for diagnosed hypertension.  No Training, Complete difference between how contractors and employees are treated even though providing same service.  Setup for failure in most cases.  Management changing constantly.  No documentation in place for anything."
bad,"A typical work day was never typical. Some days it could be a normal 10 hour day and others I could be there for 17 hours. When I was a patient care tech I Always had to use my customer service skills whether you knew it or not. People on dialysis are there because they need you to filter their blood to save their lives. I would need to calm them and make them feel safe through their treatments. That was the hardest part of my job. Also when you would have to pull together as a team if someone coded and you needed to save their life and preform CPR until the medics got there. People trusted you with their lives. I then became part of management when I was Chief Technician. I was in charge of all the maintenance of the machines, in-services and OSHA regulations. I also ordered all the medications for the facility. I had amazing hard working co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you made a difference. I helped save lives everyday. The management at that time had a hard time managing. It has since put in an amazing manager and the clinic is thriving."
bad,"Think twice before applying to this company. Had way too many managers, not enough appreciation, backstabbing among other administrative assistants. I can honestly say I would never work for this company again. My last manager was amazing however before him, it was a lot of headaches."
bad,I do not recommend working here if you are a single parent  it’s impossible to leave if you do not find someone to come in and cover your shift. There is no work balance
bad,"Leadership is not supportive of its team. Dishonest leader, not truthful and dosen't make himself available for the patients or teammates. As large as the company is you have to know the right people to advance."
bad,"Management and supervisor for DaVita was horrible. As an outside coming in, regardless of dialysis experience, it was very hard to fit into the environment with fellow coworkers"
bad,"The hours for Davita start at the crack of dawn, and the staffing is so short you always stay for 12 pluse hours. Wouldnt be so bad if the day didnt start at 4-5am... Need more 8 hour shifts too balance out life & families outside of work. And definitely bring back bonuses go give employees something to look forward too if they're at work more then home!!"
bad,"Caring for the patients is very rewarding.However management dont care about employees.They keep cutting our hours and expect us to get the same amount of job done. They throw you on a work schedule without asking if u can do a particular shift that you didnt sign up for when you got employed.For example, you will be scheduled to work nights when you only sign up to work days. They tried to get you to do your 8 hrs job in 5 hrs so they can send you home early.Very disappoint with this company."
bad,"It depends on management. The managers with 4yrs or more of college are great to work with. The ones with HS diplomas generally are bossy.  "
bad,Everything for a buck no patient care.all about money . How are you in too many people on the outside people that used to be bagelers at Walmart and outpatient care tax they don’t know how to take blood pressure’s nurses fresh out of school so they don’t have to pay them and managers with no experience and don’t even know what dialysis Is.the worst of all big companies
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Hands down , DaVita is the worst company I have ever worked for. Expectation is.50+ hours of work for 40 hours pay.  Shame based culture. Employees can never do enough to satisfy upper mansgement"
bad,"Upper leadership is awful, not trustworthy. No promotion from within, threatened with lack of job security when you don't meet metrics for one month. Teammates run the company."
bad,"Management would not even be 1 star!!! She is a joke!!! Very unconfidential!!! If you are not in the office brown nosing or gossiping, then you are a nobody to management!!!"
bad,It has been many years since I left the company. I do not think it is fair for me to provide review for the company since it has been too long. it was OK company to work if you don't mind low pay.
bad,DaVita had unrealistic ideas about what they expected of their employees. They cont to bring in non-clinical persons to manage clinical personnel. They needed to at least hire people w/Health Administration degrees not just business degrees. It became more of a numbers game everyday to get work accomplished.
bad,My boss was fired from Davita within 3 months of my being hired.  The application development for which I was hired was cancelled.  The IT team was a disorganized mess with several serious errors that could have cost both the patient and the government unnecessary expense and inadequate treatment.
bad,Was open about My weakness and strengths and did not feel like there was help where my weakness lied.   AS a hospital RN  there needs to be more work on getting more RN's hired and a fair amicable schedule for everyone. Not some work more weekends then others. Staff should be split at least to every other weekend and holiday.
bad,"If your in the ""Click"" your good, if your honest hard working employee they totally take advantage of you."
bad,"davita  of springfield national trails clinic is clickish, the mangment doesn't follow protocals of  company or cms. they live  by  their  own  rules.  team is a big thing in healthcare  but .not  this  clinic.  i worked a  couple  of   davitas clinics this is  the  worst. managment  will yell at   you, tell   the floor staff ""you are  killing  your pts.""   because  some  are noncompliant.  if your not in   the click you will open and   close do  all the long hours and they work no one else wants   to   do. no  holidays off     if     you  are  not managments click and  if you   don;t    have small children you  will  pull all thee    long  hours, always. no teamwork at all. pass  the     buck  is  there moto."
bad,This company promises you a lot but fails to deliver. The work life balance is non existent and it is difficult to maintain any relationships outside of the company without some bleed through. Not recommended
bad,"No longer the partner & provider of choice... They've done away with bonuses for techs & incentives to help out on off days. They expect more and more, but take away more and more rather than give. The turn over rate is so extensive because they don't want to pay nor do they wish to take care of the staff that they have currently, etc..."
bad,They pay low and work you over. Davita micro manages everything you do. It's like your a prisoner to your desk.  Supervisors are cut throat.  The managers and always watching your productivity. Its very th stressful.  Trying to leave.
bad,"Patient safety is often put on the back burner for this company. Management bonuses are more important than the patients. It’s sad, but clear to see. When you are hired in they talk all about their core values and how much they mean to the company, but once hired in, you see that they are just words written down to make the company sound better and to get employees."
bad,No problem with most co-workers. company and  management is very poor. Always short staffed.  Hires anyone most new staff is lazy which leave it up to the older staff to pick up the slack.
bad,The office was very competitive and not transparent. I was performing the job of two people without appropriate compensation. Would have enjoyed more time to put better quality into work but unable to due to demands.
bad,"Long work days (13-15 hours day).  No work/life balance.  Could work a full scheduled week and they still expect you to wok overtime for an additional 2 day, if you didn't management would scold you for not working hard enough."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Worked with DaVita as a student and used it as a stepping stone to getting my nurses license. No supportive staff or management, lack of teamwork, worked short staff the whole time I work here, high turnover, and lower paid compared to other Dialysis clinics. Training is done well and sets you up to know how to do your job, education is a big focus for staff and patients. Learned a lot, and got to definitely understand the dark side of healthcare and working for a for profit company."
bad,Concern with this company living it's mission and values - It is a culture driven by the healthcare dollar and not by the true safety of the patients.  Leadership is well said and not well done!
bad,"Though, at times, Davita is an okay place to work.  It is definitely not the company it promotes/prides itself to be.  Work/life balance is one of the main factors Davita uses to promote itself to potential teammates.  However, once employed, you quickly find out that this factor is of zero importance to immediate as well as upper management.  The work hours are EXTREMELY long and they start VERY early!! Most units are severely understaffed and all upper management cares about is what labor numbers look like versus the budget.  It doesn't matter to management if a teammate is in a unit working from 4:00 a.m. until 8 p.m. as long as the budget numbers stay under control.  "
bad,"Took the job just as a fill in position. Really liked taking care of the patients and getting to know them and their families. The patients dying was the toughest part of the job, and the management sucks and only cares about making money and not concerned about you or your patients"
bad,"This company seems to use the people for their own benefit, the patients suffer because of this. They over work employees and underpay them. The managers seem to have to rely on lies in order provide coverage for understaff clinics. They over expanding with out having the staff in place. They didn't even match the 401k until recently. They were giving some sad bonus in returned that did not compensate for the 401k matching.  Manager are more worry with the clinic numbers than the employees that are doing the work, without them the clinics will fall apart. They don't seem to understand or care that, if you don't treat your employers good, then they will not stay. Therefore, the trend continues and the patients always get the bad part of this deal."
bad,I spend most of my time at davita 15 maybe 17 hours and as a single parent it is hard you have no life outside davita the don't pay well at all when I started I came in at 13.50 not they start out at 14.50 not worth it then the work that is required is worth a lot more than they pay
bad,I have learned a great deal learning dialysis. The information is very detailed. Learned management skills as well and new application. I was given the opportunity to work with patients.
bad,"I dont want to review them, but i am being forced to do so. How is this sentence structure for you? O they are understaffed and management never helps when short. is this good now?"
bad,To be management doesn't mean your best for the position just means to made the right people your friends no matter what you had to do to get there. The over all company seems like they care but the area I was in was very tainted by poor management. I would have never left if there was different management.
bad,"Worked at the unit for 10yrs when DaVita bought unit, went downhill from there. Managment could care less unless you kiss butt, benefits stink. PTO ya right hours may be there, but not able to take time off because under staffed. They are all about the almighty dollar not the patient"
bad,"My training after a year was not completed according to my contract.  I loved my patients and the job I did, but the coworkers were all in it for themselves and the management was the same"
bad,Poor training of work needed to be executed.  Was trained by 3 different co-workers in which I was taught 3 different ways of working accounts.   Poor management.  Supervisor didn't like me completing my job faster than what she can give me to work on.   Only was a temp position.
bad,Obvious disconnect between senior management's vision and reality.  Direct management is indecisive and does not support employees.  Huge turn over.
bad,"there is discrimination in the workplace, favoritism, bad management, multiple lies about bonuses and pay increase, no integrity"
bad,No supportive management the culture drove quality people away continually which left the patients receiving poor care and being treated with less than the dignity which they deserved.
bad,"The only good thing about this company is they help patients and give back to the community.  Beware of drinking the kool aide and the village concept is a total joke. Their compensation is low, work/life balance is nonexistent, healthcare benefits expensive and not that great, no match on 401k but they can build an extravagant headquarters, really?? Community first,  company second...more like bottom line first and let the big shots reep the benefits while the rest of the ""teammates"" bust their butts to get the job done. High turnover too! Completely disappointed and hope they can make some changes and actually live up to their 7 Core Values instead of talking about them."
bad,"Working day to day enhancements and parsing out new development with developers reporting to me."
bad,"The Company has become so obsessed with saving money that the safety of the patient has become compromised. The role of the Charge Nurse has now become the role of a PCT/Charge Nurse. The Company saves the $ by not having an extra ""body"" in the clinic and the Charge Nurse runs the PCT's patients in addition to the responsibilities that he/she has; ie assessments, taking off orders, drawing/giving medications, documenting, etc. That's not counting if something should go wrong and someone has to go out 911; then you really better hold on to your pants. It's unsafe; it looks good on paper but it is too close and I'm not comfortable with it, besides everything is too rushed; it doesn't give you any time to give good patient care anymore."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,The management at DaVita was horrid. They hire people who know people and not people who know about managing or working. The co-workers were awful they made fun of my religion as well as my race. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the patients. The rest really sucked. I would NOT work for DaVita again!
bad,no local integrity. Lots of management turn over. No support.
bad,The sole goal for this company is to make money. If it takes short changing the workers and making you work a harder load with less pay.
bad,"The values they claim to have make it sound like dream jobs. But few truly live them. The management is poor and many managers have been promoted over their heads and to the limit of their capabilities. As much as they espouse their ""outstanding"" training, the reality is that it is horrible, tedious and has little to do with what you actually do daily."
bad,Nice mission statement and values written but not followed.
bad,"I love DaVita. I just had a bad experience with management. They are unprofessional, untrustworthy, budget driven and less patient centered, they use you but don’t want to pay, and it’s all a game of who knows who to determine who will be promoted. The academy changed my life. It taught me to learn my employer. When i realized who I was working under and that they didn’t have my best interest at heart, I left."
bad,"I worked there for several years and I received no support from supervisors, orientation was poor, seniority meant nothing, unrealistic expectations. Managers that have no dialysis experience. No recognition for good employees."
bad,This is job is not for everyone. you cannot have a life outside of here. they work you 3-5 days a week working from 12 to 16 hour days. You can possible work all your days back to back. if you or a child becomes ill you have to find your own coverage. they do not assist with that.
bad,Many incredible team members.  Clinic leadership hit or miss.  High turnover.  Metric driven at the expense of people.  WHQ is beautiful and trendy.  Enjoy coming to work.  Great on site dining.  Overall benefits package is above average.  PTO is An area in need of improvement.
bad,"This clinic was extremely unorganized as far as scheduling staff hours and patients' appts.  The staff was not treated well at all. The patient/tech ratio was awful. I would work some days without even a break to use the restroom, eat or get a drink of water. We were always running out of supplies that we needed every day. It was difficult work for little money."
bad,Really hypocritical management from the top down.  They promoted their so-called values incessantly but senior management acted against those principles routinely.
bad,"DaVita is a great company if you need dialysis but is not a great place to work. Senior management is not in touch with the people, and prefer to spend money on cutesy programs and initiatives, rather than invest in the staff."
bad,Working short staffed and without contact to your nursing supervisor is the usual. Short-cuts are expected. Very little actual education is given to patients.
bad,"Although I had some great co-workers the company as a whole doesn't value or respect it's employees.  If you're not ""in the click""  you have no protection from being a target.  If you report an issues to H.R as soon as you hang up they are calling the manager to let them know even though it's suppose to be confidential.  Don't let me get started on how they treat the patients."
bad,This was by far the worse position I have ever had in my entire life. DaVita doesn't provide the training to ensure success or create a fostering environment for the new manager. I wouldn't recommend this role to anyone.
bad,"The workplace culture is great, there is a lot of time spent making sure peoples day to day experience is the best it can be by providing snacks, massages, etc. and the office socials are amazing. Everyone is very friendly and always make time to help you when your in need. There are great training and development opportunities and you get a sense that it is a company that is going somewhere, there is always a drive to..."
bad,"As an Acute hemodialysis RN working in the hospital setting, once you arrive at work you never know when you'll be able leave depending on the # of patients for that day. I have worked 24 hours and only get an 8 hour break before having to come back in all while still being on call. They do not follow Missouri regulations due to the MO regulations being designed for hospitals, and Davita the company itself is not a hospital, so it does not have to follow those regulations. Supervisors do not like having employees question the # of hours worked, because everything ""has always been this way"", and the RN's that have been there for years insist that since they had to work that many hours without complaint, the new RN's should, too."
bad,Davita wanted you to put all family and friends and life aside for them but also did not want to compensate in pay or any other benifits turn. They expected high quality care and work ethic for little pay or regard for the employees they had.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"The company has gone from night to day over all the years I worked there. Management has made a mess in the department, and if your not a favorite you will not be able to succeed, and they will find away to get rid of you."
bad,I wouldn't advise anyone to work at this company Unless you don't have kids & you don't mind putting your license or certification at risk by performing a task you aren't qualified to do.  The employee hotline doesn't help the employees because as soon as you make a complaint they call or email the facility administrator & not only tell them about the complaint but moreso who made it which puts an X on your back & within 90 days they will find a reason to terminate you.... But if you do decide to work for them document Everything!
bad,It's a self-serve company.  Very little guidance provided in job training.  Can not go directly to someone to ask question if its needed.  Your directed to job aids and unless you know what you are looking for it could take an entire day or more to find the correct job aid to assist you.  No consistence communication between disciplines which could make it difficult to complete job task.
bad,"Acute Dialysis in Michigan.--  Very understaffed ,  retention of new staff is terrible most leave 3-6 months post training due to management expectations and hours or find better pay. .  Only new grads need to apply as they will not pay the cost of experienced RN's  On the plus side plenty hours most mandatory. 18-24 hour shifts frequent"
bad,"There is immense pressure to work extra hours and shifts and to travel long distances to cover clinics other than your home clinic. The ""team"" philosophy requires blind allegiance to a company that is just like other health care providers--extracting all they can out of employees and pressuring staff to carry workloads that compromise the quality of patient care. The DaVita culture and trainings around it are ridiculous...too much time and money spent trying to convince employees that it is a great company and a great place to work. If it were true, they would not have to keep telling employees; it would be obvious!"
bad,Management team is horrible. Favoritism.  Broken promises.  Lay-offs have begun.  Automation is taking over in the new lab and they are laying people off.Stay far away from this broken business.
bad,"Left after 2 years, never intended to leave but after watching half the floor leave to a competitor and they hired temps and 18 yr old new hires at 2-3$ more then seasoned teammates was upsetting. I knew I had to go after my career conversation came and I told my leadership that I dont know what the future holds as one of my paychecks go to daycare, his reply ( infront of my supervisor) said.."" You still have another check though! "" His disregard for my struggle told me he didnt value me as a teammate, although I helped resolve $10 million in my book of business."
bad,"More bang for your buck mentality. Staff RN (especially on nights) responsible for being PCT and handling RN duties. Unrealistic nurse to patient ratio. Manager out of touch with staff / staffing needs. FA is non-Clinical (SW), no clue of how stressful caring for ESRD patients can be."
bad,"Typically at work I would meet with patients at their dialysis chair and staff for current issues such as problems or assessments and signing paperwork.  Then I would work in my office doing paperwork or on the phone linking with other community service providers. Grant requirements required several hours of work monthly.  I worked more hours than I was paid, and there were no benefits other than a 401K with only my contributions.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people."
bad,"Work life balance is poor"
bad,"Difficult to work with managment. There is no opportunity for PCT to advance."
bad,"They do not seem to care that they have such a high rate of turnover with their nurses or managers, yet the technicians get away with very poor behavior, bullying culture and insubordination."
bad,I only got 14.00 per hour I think they do this because they train you and give you the skills to be a better dialysis tech but the hours are crazy long and I feel like the work and money just don't add up
bad,"Management is so far out of touch with reality, and couldn't care less about the people that they are bringing on. Coworkers were constantly being overloaded with additional work, and it really makes it difficult/impossible to provide a good level of care to the patients. The job description was vastly different from what I interviewed and trained for. After working there, it's no longer a surprise as to why the company has resorted to bait-and-switch hiring tactics."
bad,"The culture was very artificial, pushed down from the Colorado management.  No trust, no advancement, overtime hours, low pay.  Many unhappy employees."
bad,"Overall, I loved my patients but the facility administrator is not present.  If they were, it would change the culture of the job.  Nurses are expected to take patients and do tech work and also split the floor for RN work.  Fast-paced and the day goes quickly but its the same game day in and out."
bad,"They can never seem to get employees to stay. They either leave for something much better, or they get fired. I've seen multiple firings in 3 years. Most stressful place I've worked at. But then again, I know other people who work at different sites and they are happy there."
bad,"The tema I worked with were lazy and inconsiderate. The techs seemed to get pregnant just so they could get paid but not actually work. However, I loved what I did and it made it worth it for me to help prolong the lives of others."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"When there is a mass exodus, you have to stop and think about what is really going on around you. "
bad,Excellent values however not emphasized or enhanced at the clinical level. The higher level of management are very attentive to your issues the only thing is that the expectation from lower management to get it right doesnt do much justice
bad,"Work was stressful  and fast-paced. Focus was on speedy patient turnover and not quality patient care. Training, supervision and teamwork was very poor."
bad,"No time for family, Davita doesn't take into consideration for employees who have illness. Very cut throat,  slave driven, management aweful, you go in at night,  and leave at night. Work 16 hrs, then turn around and go back the very next morning at 4 a.m., lots bigotry.  If they don't like you, your life there will be miserable."
bad,The management is absolutely terrible.  They hire people in positions of power that manage by intimidation and bullying.  There are people here that have no business working in health care.
bad,If you are a facility administrator DaVita doesn't believe in life/work balance. The company believes that they come first and metrics are more important than patients.
bad,"DaVita has issues with communication, and is unorganized. I do not believe the culture is as good for contract employees as it is for full time employees. There is a double standard with the two designations, and the company goes out of their way to make contractors feel like they are second class citizens. Bad place for a contract employee."
bad,Leadership needs significant training on being more teammate friendly.  Insufficient time available to work with teammates.  Pay is insufficient for the work that is expected of teammates.
bad,"Currently 3 CEO's in 3 years, lay offs in April, structure and communication currently missing or not being passed down.  On the positive side, a staff that is trying to make it better and has the best intentions."
bad,My schedule would change from day to day which resulted in less time for my family. The training was poor and I was basically left by myself after little hands on training which I didn't think was fair for the patients and myself. Communication with my supervisor was not good. While I would communicate how I felt she would be texting on her phone.
bad,"If I didn't have to work there I would not hard work and you are never hear  ""Thank you"" The people them selves are very nice but the company needs a lot of work."
bad,"Management is horrible, horrible horrible and can be harassing too. Disrespect is the common attitude there. Mistreating employees from manager is very common as they dont put attention to who they hire or promote to management position. Usually, nurses who are promoted to management are the most rude and disrespectful. Belittling of new nurses and techs/nurses. Worst place I have ever worked. Toxic and hostile environment."
bad,Could have been one of the greatest stories in corporate America but has lost its way. It is now just another huge healthcare company that is only interested in the bottom line and not its employees or patients.
bad,its ok the management is no good they say one thing and then its a different story when the time comes. your job description is not detailed correctly. they say you get x amount of hours and then you work your getting sent home early and not meeting your hours for the week. there if definitely no room for advancement unless you go to school to become a RN other than that you are stuck as a PCT and the pay is not great at all. Fresenius pays wayyy more. Its not diverse as it seems
bad,"I currently work 14 hour days that are non stop from the time I get to work, until the end of my day. I have been working as a Hemodialysis Technician. The best part of my job, are the patients and the amount of care I can provide to them. The hardest part for myself, is, sticking patients with needles (they are going into a major artery, so lots of potential blood and it's very painful for the patient). This is not an easy task for myself, but may be for others. There is a lot to learn in this position and it feels a little like a 10 week crash course to becoming a nurse, especially if you have no real medical background. There are a lot of problems that are extremely life threatening that can happen, so the stress levels are high and you have to make sure you are able to learn all the corrections and how to fix them or how to be aware of them before they happen. My  Co-workers are great; however, management is very ""micromanaged."" You every move is watched and the smallest instance, will serve you with a write up. This makes for a very stressful, uncomfortable work environment. No sick days, as you are not allowed to be sick, or it's looked at as a sign of weakness, no 401K matching, and the schedule is inconsistent. There is no guarantee of full time work, even if you are hired on as a full time employee."
bad,This unit is horrible they don't care about their patients or staff all they are worried about is time and money. Managers are highly unprofessional. Pct's are highly overworked and underpaid including patient care housekeeping chores biomed work and patients must be on and off on time. Management does not ever take responsibility for anything they want the staff on the floor to do so and wash their hands.
bad,Number 1 thing about this place is the patients. Loved seeing the patients on a regular basis. Learned a lot about dialysis. Hardest part of the job was getting close to the patients and knowing that some did not have much time left. Happiest part about the job was seeing those patient who got kidney transplants and got to stop dialysis treatments. The only reason I would not work for this company again is because I truly feel that they do not care about their employees. There was too much back stabbing and arguing between employees and the teamwork just wasn't there. I actually hated waking up in the morning knowing I had to go back. Not because of the patients because of the staff. Management had come and gone but finally got a new manager. She has a lot to deal with. Glad I'm stress free now.
bad,Loved all the patients and co-workers workig the floor.Managment is hard to deal with not family orientated at all and not good pay.12 hour days almost always went over by a couple hours.ALways short staffed as well.But if your Fa is a good one things are great!!
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,If you quit the company they FA are very vendictive towards you. Even if you use to work hard when you are with the company.
bad,"I believe the overall company has a good position on patient care.  My particular experience at specific facility was not favorable.  I was in training, but was not trained to be a teammate, it was more like a trial."
bad,The relationship you build with patients was the only real rewarding thing I got from this job. The overall company has good ideas but the clinic where I was at was awful. The employees acted like it was high school there by bullying and shunning you if you didn't fit in to their way of thinking and doing things. The patients were not treated very well by the nurses and management either.
bad,"In the majority of the clinics in the Atlanta-Metro area Dietitians are not provided with adequate support to achieve clinical outcomes. In DaVita people capable of believing inspiring rhetoric and unable to process it’s disconnect from actual practice are supremely happy ""teammates."" DaVita's CEO is the highest paid in this category of healthcare companies. He is a handsome, brilliant public relations master, and he has an insatiable appetite for applause. DaVita has learned how to use soaring language, megatrons and constant propaganda to substitute for 401K match, for promotion from within, and most importantly, for staffing dialysis clinics well enough to minimize clinical error and allow nurses/Dietitians/techs/Social Workers to do the patient care that would live up to the core values. DaVita abuses the facility managers to the point that the most competent, patient-centered RNs would never take the job, and when they do, they go back to the floor after a few years, realizing the rhetoric was hollow and they are going to be pounded relentlessly to compromise patient care. To stoke the ego of the CEO, DaVita has begun to recruit regional managers from Ivy-League schools who have no medical background or professional medical ethics--giving Kent Thiry (or KT) the opportunity to pretend he's Steve Jobs mentoring tomorrow's business tycoons. KT has a genius for PR, getting flattering profiles published in newspapers, mobilizing employees to vote for him in various industry polls, getting employees to do charity walks for the PAC DaVita used to oppose healthcare reform. People"
bad,"You are as good as your numbers, and as long as you NEVER say a word or ANGER the managers favorites, you'll be JUST FINE!!!"
bad,Im currently working as a patient care technician. I work 12 hour shifts 6 days at a time. This position requires A LOT of work which has you constantly on your feet and on the move the whole time you're there. I feel like I'm terribly underpaid for the hard work I invest in making this company what it is. Where I currently work and what I see at a lot of other clinics are favoritism. It's pretty hard to move up unless you suck up. I would not recommend working here unless you REALLY need a job. I suggest having a backup plan.
bad,"It seems like a great company on the surface, but it is all about politics and popularity. The hourly associates run the clinic and Regional management caters to every whim. Managers never get help to fill the patient need, so we are constantly barely in compliance. CCs are constantly overworked as Charge RNs on the floor. They are more concerned about being popular than making good business decisions. Wasteful spending and too much time spent with ridiculous HR things."
bad,Davita is an ok company to work at but they don't pay well and it is hard to advance in this company.
bad,"There was a lack of teamwork, and very poor administration when there was a facility administrator. The schedule was very erratic and made it very hard to have a work life balance."
bad,I haven't worked  in  a year due to illness with husband and myself. When I was working I want back to school twice and I never received a raise or a higher pay. People have got hired with no experience making more than me.
bad,"They need more qualified and honest supervisors. They need to support their core values, especially integrity. No clinical difference in patient care should be top priority not how much money they can make off the patients during such a difficult time in their life. You are expected to take on additional roles with no increase in compensation. They should set more realistic goals for teammates. Unexpected changes in pay are not fair as well as setting income limits for employees."
bad,The company use to be for the teammates now they’re about money. The changes that came about recently with this company is confusing and it’s costing them. The clinics are always short and no one is happy. It’s too many families working with each other. There’s so much wrong with this company now. I would avoid the St. Louis region.
bad,This company lied too much all they wanted to do was party and drink and occasionally do work. They talk bad about the patients and call them annoying. They do not help you they just criticize you all the time and if you do not want to go drinking with them then you’re out of the group and up for fire. When a client lies on you and you tell the truth and they listen to the call and see you told the truth they still will take the clients side and fire you.
bad,When I worked there the place first opened and the staff and patients were all knew.  The clientele of patients and staff were not the best. The daily job functions were basic.
bad,"the Facility administrator i worked with was very ignorant. did not know how to address people and could get disrespectful. she hired her friends so the people she didnt care for worked extra hard. the nurses are extremely lazy including the FA. i would not recommend anyone work for Davita. go to Fresenius, they pay more."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"This isn’t going to be one of those reviews that bashes DaVita. This is an okay company to work for. I just had a horrible experience. From the get go, I was told that I would be compensated full time for training, which I was. However, once I got out of training they were basically like “Find somewhere to work” since I was at a new clinic, with no patients. Some weeks, I struggled to even get 30 hours a week. Also, I was traveling all over the city, which was 100% not a part of the job description or expectations. In my interview, I was asked if I could be Administrative Assistant and Patient Care Technician, due to my experience. They explained it as “you just sit at the front desk and greet people and take insurance.” They made is sound SO easy. Little did I know, the job was SO demanding and they only allowed me 10 hours a week, when it is a full time job. I was responsible for all paperwork, patient education, charts, ordering, inventory, employee time clocks, filing, all admissions of new patients, all in 10 hours a week. It was IMPOSSIBLE. Since I got out of training in October, I have had to use my off time EVERY single paycheck to ensure that I reached 40 hours, or even close to it. Since now being part time at my new clinic, I have experienced unacceptable behavior. I have experienced mental and emotional abuse from the “nurse.” I put that in quotes because I have never met an RN who is so incompetent and rude. I complained endless times to management, verbally and written, and nothing was ever done. Do not have this job if you want any kind of life outside of work."
bad,"However, management is running this as a business with a disregard to healthcare advantages and patient care. The treatment team works very hard in caring for patients. However, this staff is oversaw by a management team with no healthcare experience and lacks empathy and awareness in patient care. They hire individuals for management positions from businesses such as Target. It is understood that Davita is a private company and every business has to succeed by making money. However the managers are overseeing healthcare professional, such as, social workers, RN's, dieticians, and technicians who have more knowledge and experience in the dynamics of healthcare. Yet, these managers are paid more, receiving bonus, and evaluating healthcare professionals for annual incentive."
bad,"This company was a joy to work for when I started years ago. It has since become a company that is more focused on making money rather than patient care and customer service. The Administrative staff in some of the clinics is questionable, there is favoritism in the work place. Everyone is not treated fairly or equally. I would not recommend this company for long term employment. They most difficult part of this job is making it through the day! there is a no retaliation policy with this company but, it is not enforced!! The best part in working for the company and being at work on a daily is the PATIENTS!!! I TRULY LOVE THEM!!!!"
bad,When I first started there it was a company I was proud to work for. But now after all the layoffs all the lies I can say I regret my decision to work here . I feel deeply sad for all of our patients. They have pretty ok benefits and my management were very good and tried to keep the DaVita culture alive . But in the end the hire ups had their own ugenda .
bad,"Micromanagement occurs frequently within this company which makes it difficulty to do a job. "
bad,I did not like dialysis and the we were short staffed with a lot of patients to care for throughout the day.  It was a very stressful environment.  Dialysis is not for me.
bad,"Coming from a progressive area who always worked at the highest of my degree, I found Davita to fall short.  Management inexperienced and not proficient, standard of care less than I was used to and, knowledge base of staff was adequate but, only adequate most of the time. Knowledge of social related issues was minimal and the staff itself was very ""ruff around the edges"" and, at times valued personal need over client care. Team dynamics were the worst I have experienced in my career."
bad,"Within my time working as an admission specialist, the company was fined by the government multiple times for dishonesty. I have seen numerous cases where Nephrologist who are JV partners are getting their patients placed as a priority. Working conditions are not fair. Workloads are higher and less paid than positions at competitors. Job security is non existent. One of our offices in Texas was closed with 2 months notice. 30 employees including managers were laid off."
bad,"at my time of employment here, the culture of the facilities was very stressful. Many times there were multiple call offs and limited staff to care for the patient load."
bad,You’ll be working at least 50 hours a week. Mandatory overtime. Yes you get benefits. You get a decent paycheck (not how much you SHOULD make). Too many tasks. Too many hours. No life and no body cares. Don’t have any family emergencies or you won’t be given days off. This company was beautiful at the beginning. Not anymore.
bad,Its a very stressful job and has low pay and poor benefits. The best part of the job is working with the patients. Extra duties are put onto the staff.
bad,I would not wish working here on anyone. Once you have a foot in the door they will do whatever they can to try and keep you here other than pay you what you actually need to survive.
bad,"It is a wonderful opportunity to allow staff to truly get to know their patients and develop a professional yet truly caring relationship. However, the budget is the primary focus, leaving staff to struggle to provide quality care without the proper amount of staff. There are times I have worried for patient safety as staff is pulled in so many directions to provide truly adequate safe care. At times, the nurse to patient ratio is 14 to 16 to 1 nurse. To top it off, the nurses are responsible for ""programs"" to monitor for overall patient care and success. Trying to find the time is close to impossible without compromising immediate direct patient care and staff support. I absolutely love the job and the patients, just not the unsafe and unrealistic staffing ratio."
bad,"Casual dressed fun work place. The DaVita culture is different than any other company I worked for. Besides the pay, I loved everything else the company had to offer."
bad,The job was stressful due to poor management. The patients were great. I worked 60+ hrs a week and worked six days sometimes. My co-workers were great
bad,"I left voluntarily and on good terms so I do not write this review with malice or ill will.  The IT department is mismanaged.  Current Help Desk management hierarchy is in place based on popularity and who is married to whom, not because of experience and/or knowledge.  As an example, one of the IT Help Desk Department supervisors literally does not know how to ""install"" a monitor.  "
bad,This company is focused on numbers = profit. Your manager and his manager are business people. The patient needs are lost due to the culture focus-$$.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"In my time with Davita, I have found that there is SEVERE lack "
bad,"Stressful clinic environment.  Constantly short staffed and have to run patients, as well as assess and administer medications. Lucky if you get a lunch break.  Pay raises are a joke!"
bad,"Poor management, many long work days,often without lunch breaks, enjoyed the patient care and hospital staff. Poor work life balance due to long days."
bad,"The benefits are pretty good, but they cost more than Davita said they would when they took over our company, Mgmt. disorganized. No work/life balance"
bad,"Patient are in need of good care and more nurse supervision.Mangers are sometime not medically educated"
bad,"A clinical coordinator that was not always helpful.  Management that would hardly be around at times, and did not seem to manage very well.  Hours were a lot of times were 12+.  Ran out of supplies to do our job appropriately."
bad,"Leadership doesn't know which direction to go unless there are fires to put out. Very reactive organizational structure. Senior leadership lacks responsiveness, career opportunity or growth feedback and development."
bad,"Management picks favorites having nothing to do with performance. Company motto is suppose to be all about family and making sure they come first, this is NOT the case! Company allows bullying among employees and HR does nothing to resolve when reported."
bad,The upper level Staff is the good old boys club. Wadges are very lo not on par with ind. standards. They will spend money on parties but lack in raises .Work life balance is very bad under staffed
bad,"Older professionals, even though facility is pretty awesome (gym, pool, pingpong, etc) very few people take advantage, departments are segregated. very strong company culture, you have to drink the koolaid, I personally did not fit in."
bad,"Good comradarie with fellow case managers, good training"
bad,"Typical work day: 16-18 hours"
bad,Treatments of Chronic and Acute dialysis patients.I really enjoyed the patients and relationships I had with them and fellow employees. I was unable to have a life due to the poorest scheduling I have ever seen. At tomes we had to contact the mgr Sunday night to see what we worked on Monday. We were not able to have set days off or schedule personal things outside of work.
bad,poor work life balance.  Company has a strong culture and a team enviroment however it stretches its employees too thin to obtain requested benchmarks and goals
bad,longs days crazy hours.  Days do go by fast and you meet all kinds of people
bad,"Company seems good to work for, manager was AWFUL. Company values important, management not carried out core values"
bad,"lots of qualified people not there on Monday mornings. Play the game, jump through the hoops and hold your breath come friday! Years of service, equal higher pay rate, equals being fired for some bogus reason and then the unemployment fight! Open door policy until they close it !"
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Was told on my interview that Davita is a fun company to work for and nothing like any other company out there. They played pictionary and had a fun environment. Then things changed in my 4 month in. Management would come around and micro-manage. Even when you would talk for a few minutes to a coworker, you were accused of not working. Everything then was about numbers and money so they are not any different than most companies."
bad,"DaVita was great in the beginning, once KT left the overall positive energy left with him.  No longer was this a provider and employer of choice.   Upper management mindset changed just as drastically.   I understand that this is a business trying to profit with ever changing healthcare requirements. However cuts in labor made for unsafe working conditions, lack of consideration for patient acuity.  Teammate morale has gone by the wayside from a company standpoint, yet they focus strongly on retention, even with toxic teammates. Teammates are worked nonstop with   duties and champ roles constantly added, to an already busy schedule.   Daily struggles with staffing, leading to burnout with most teammates"
bad,"Hard place to work. 14-18 hr days for nurses. Nurse are being made accountable for patient attendance and labs. Moral of techs was usually low, no one wanted to do their jobs."
bad,"Loooonnnggg hours. Very early hours, lots of physical demand. Must be able to lift and be very comfortable with blood and needles and have a tough stomach because the smell is horrible"
bad,"Pros-Working closely with patients is very enjoyable. "
bad,The day to day work in ROPS is very monotonous and the pay in unfortunately quite low compared to market average. Coworkers were great but I don't find that is a fair assessment of the company itself. Growth is very slow as well.
bad,"I think the FA is not fair when it come to displine.FA plays favoritism when it come to other ccht.i would have to write a book to tell everything.a typical day at work is a migraine headache,you never know what going to happen with staff.this particular site most of the time is under staff,staff member come and goes as they please."
bad,The company posted excellent last quarter and year to date financial results but penalized their hourly workers for local budget short comings that have nothing to with the workers job performance. Shame.
bad,"Their quality of patient care left me feeling like it was more about numbers than patients . The time limitations in getting a patient on and off of the machines left the patients making remarks like "" I felt like I was just thrown in the chair and stuck"" , "" I dont feel like anyone here takes the time to really pay attention"", ""if you would slow down and hold the site for a minute it might stop bleeding"" ... ""Get em in and Get em out "" was a common phrase on the floor . I moved in to a more administrative role and found the same process . It was all a numbers game . The phrase then was If they have to be rolled in on a gurney they can be educated ,we need them to count ! I found shortcuts and other questionable to be common in every position . The pay does not cover the demand they put on their employees although the benefits are pretty good . If the patient matters to you this is not the job for you ."
bad,no a good place for me did not lean anything traning was ok just got put on the floor with no help from the floor people ……………………………………………………………………...
bad,"Poor, poor, poor morale and blind to it.  Manager unavailable and partial ignoring charge nurse concerns.  Preceptor did not train by policy and staff does their own thing with impunity."
bad,"Terrible pay, Work 10-15 hours a day every other day. Flexible schedules sometimes. Free food sometime's. Bad management. Stressful work environment. If you really love dialysis this would be a good place to start. Good for the experience"
bad,Davita does not offer benefits like they use to. It is a struggle to achieve market salary with Davita for any field. As an Administrative Assistant and PCT I cover 2 sometimes 3 facilities and travel multiple times a week to these places and the compensation just doesn't add up.
bad,"After my 18 years of service i was totally shocked to know we were sold out to another company.  I was not compensated in no wise, which i thought i should have.  All in all it was an experience working there seeing once i was in management with the company.  Upon treated unfairly i steeped down from the position and returned to what i loved most and that was caring for my patients on a one on one basis"
bad,"Nurses work like dogs. There is always a struggle of powers between nurses and techs. Long hours,  5am until 7pm or later sometimes . Standing up 90 percent of the day."
bad,Overall company culture is great.  Senior leadership unsupportive of patient safety and drive financial at the expense of clinical support for the patient at the region level.
bad,I really liked the part where i could work with patients. The biggest downfall is the company and the members of management. Pay is subpar for the amount of work you do. They constantly try adding work to your load without any type of compensation. They hardly allow you to take pto or any sick days because there is never any coverage.
bad,"The job was amazing, I loved all my patients, and I loved the actually job! The pay was horrible for the amount of responsibilities you have. Management was more concerned about getting her bonus then taking care of her team."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"No matter what role or position held within DaVita, you are guaranteed to be overworked. Staffing levels are minimal, and patient care is severely impacted if even one employee is running late or calls out."
bad,DaVita isn’t a bad company but the people they hire makes it a bad company. The mangers are very unprofessional. The pay doesn’t match the hardship DaVita offers
bad,Davita is very cheap and they try very hard to sale you on the moral gratifications instead of financial gains. The bonuses are a plus but those are also taxed. The patients will not take it easy on you. They are frustrated with their situation and will utilize you as an emotional punching bag.
bad,"They say all the right things to get you in the door, but they do not ""walk the talk"".  Senior management does not have integrity or accountability, nor do they follow the mission and values.  I would stay away if you are looking for a meaningful career.  If you just want a job to pay the bills, then this is the place."
bad,"I enjoyed working with patients and a learning experience and on the job training, a lot of computer training and group interaction, and client interaction helping them improve their health and well being"
bad,"Davita is willing to employ workers (Nurses), but overwork their staff.  No motivation or encouragement for employees.  Heavy work overload for employees, ."
bad,"I don’t get paid what I’m worth, and even if I was, the workload is crazy. I run around like a chicken with its head cut off for about 11-12 hours a day, literally nonstop. 30 minute lunch break. Just insane. How are teammates expected to give quality care to patients when they aren’t even given the chance to properly care for themselves, let alone their own family?!"
bad,"Davita does not provide enough training fo new techs, the pay is not good. And management is sometimes to rigid.  The communication I not good because of lack of skills."
bad,I found that I was working all the time and had little to no time to focus on family life. It was a stress filled environment and difficult to maintain.
bad,Government funding prevents people from doing what is best for the company. Whether they do a decent job or not the money keeps coming in. Often new ideas and initiatives are not good for the business.
bad,"treated patients; drawing meds. documenting vitals, etc"
bad,"A dialysis patient care technician is responsible for the technical management of hemodialysis, or blood filtering, treatment to patients with advanced kidney disease. Dialysis patient care techs are supervised by registered nurses, and they operate dialysis machines as well as provide basic patient care."
bad,"I enjoyed the patient's at OKHC. "
bad,"Loved the clients, management insensitive to employee needs. Room for growth if aligned with management perception. Very early morning hours, short staffed."
bad,Very disorganized. Management will cut hours without notice. Long hours with often no breaks. Lack of team work culture and hardly any work life balance
bad,Early morning and long hours but its only three days a week you work. Its a very rewarding job if you don't mind the change over time and long hours. I really care about my patients I care for.
bad,"Davita falls short on their primary mission at the local levels.  Clinics are not well organized in some cases, and their is consistency on their lack of quality in customer service."
bad,"Working in the clinic as a CCHT is a heavy responsibility and can be very stressful. I love my patients. I love providing a life sustaining service. The Davita way needs some improvement though. The core value's, policies and procedures are suppose to help us be more efficient and create a positive culture in the company. The problem is that the people who make these policies and procedures haven't worked the clinic floor in the capacity of a CCHT. They have unrealistic expectation and still demand quality work. Health care should never be rushed. You should not have to juggle time between your patients and the inventory of the clinic."
bad,"Culture has significantly changed over the years, fear and intimidation is the new leadership style. Hours continue to get longer each week, with the expectation of 60+ per week for middle management. Demands continue to intensify with no concern for work/life balance. Favoritism and self preservation are the norm. Financial gain has become the priority."
bad,"No clear stability of company.  Hard to manage.  Upper mgt promised a lot to staff, and middle mgt was set up for failure- could not deliver so staff was always unhappy."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"First negative thing I took notice after being hired was that it's unheard of today's industry, where a company makes you utilize your PTO time for all the major holidays, meaning if you do not have any PTO time available than you don't get paid for those holidays, most companies pay for all major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, but not this company, unless you utilize PTO time"
bad,"The hours were 15/16 hour days, rude and disrespectful patients, no support from management. Co workers were okay to work with, but not the rumor spreading ones."
bad,Davita started out as a great place to work but the management titles were passed around to much. People who shouldn't have been managers were put in positions they could not handle. Which made work-life complicated.
bad,Didn't like how they treat their people and if you don't agree with the hire authority that's in charge they don't like you. Never listen but to one side of the story and not the entire story before making opinions on what needs to be done.
bad,The RN manager was a bully not only to staff but to patients as well and has worked there for years without restraint! She lied and was very manipulative. The integrity hotline was useless. It was a zoo
bad,Your experience can vary from person to person. From floor to floor. From building to building. Its not consistent so be sure to ask about their values
bad,"Pay is really low and you will work long hours. Location was very understaffed and the turn over rate is high. Patients are relucent to allow you to learn how to cannulate them, due to you may not be working there after you 12 week on the job training."
bad,"Overall is a 2 "
bad,"Just a job working every day or all you do, thrrtr is nothing ele to tell about the company.   What is the way of owking and going on with life very difficulr with Davita\"
bad,"Davita is good at recruiting but isn't very well at maintainin their workers. They expect workers to go above and beyond for little reward. "
bad,no support from upper management to help with local issues...your just left to figure it out..loyalty means nothing..27 years down the drain for a new manager who knew nothing about the business but nobody cared enough to listen
bad,Overworked and Underpaid for the Amount of task ask to do on a daily basis. Tight-knit work environment if your in your in if they don't like you they'll find away to get rid of you.
bad,Nice people to work with. However I wouldn't recommend anyone waste there time here. They hire you for the job you don't want. Complete waste of time.
bad,"DaVita, not the worst dialysis company you could work for, but also not the best. Work life balance is non-existent, although this could be very dependent on what clinic you work at."
bad,"You could be the best and be giving your best to the company. But, Managers do not care and they have now become very commission oriented and favor contractors.Too much politics in IT department."
bad,"Not allowed to think for yourself, no one values your opinion. Low pay for the type and amount of work you have to endure. Not worth it at all. Takes over a month to even get hired."
bad,"While DaVita will always be a place to find a job....."
bad,I cannot give a true review of Davita. I have not worked there in years. Davita tends to over work their employees. Most people leave because they are burned out.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Very demanding job, worked many hours, good management, good benefits. Make sure that dialysis is your passion because you will work 4 days a week and you never know when you will be able to go home. My first day off of training i worked 19 hours."
bad,"fast paced . you will love it or it won't be for you. the work days are either Monday, Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. you can pick up hours somewhere else though."
bad,"Despite the claims made with DaVita's culture, there is no work/life balance for facility administrators.  There is an excessive amount of responsibilities with everything being a priority.  Routine work is constantly flooded with new initiatives, projects and changes.  Facility Administrators are oftten challenged with a high turnover of nurses and patient care technicians."
bad,"day start at 4am , cant leave until last patients is picked up sometimes it can be 1 hr or more after work is complete .co-workers can be lazy and not team players . meaningful work , fall in love with patients"
bad,"DaVita talks a big game about taking care of their employees but they fail to even get close to those goals.  Low pay, bad benefits, and a joke of a 401k are things that DaVita seeks to have because they do not want to ""be an industry leader"".  All of this while paying their corporate leaders hundreds of thousands in salary and benefits."
bad,Davita was a stressful job not because of the patients. It was because management does not care about you. They only listen to the older techs. As a newbie all mistakes were blamed on you.
bad,"Worked in Acutes in Vegas. Incompetent management, no work/life balance, expected to respond to emails on days off and complete computer training with no compensation week after week,  hospital staff hate Davita and call in and complain about you for the smallest things, and not enough support when you are working AT ALL!!!"
bad,1st I have to say DaVita is by far the best dialysis company when it comes to outcomes. They can have a very fun environment however with the hours needed its just really tough to make it work. The core values are great but management in my area did not really live by them. That was extremely discouraging.
bad,There was too much drama with the clinic. Then HR seemed clueless about the certain location of benefits on the website. This company seemed to only be sticking together by how great the patients are.
bad,This company has gone through many iterations of itself over the last eleven years and can't seem to figure out what it wants to be.  There is an important job to be done and they expect a lot from the employees but the compensation is lagging and there is not a lot of room for advancement.  Unfortunately leadership all the way to the top of the parent company is ok with where they fall in the marketplace for salaries.  There are individuals who are extremely underpaid and the biggest available raises won't even begin to get you where you need (deserve) to be.  They let excellent employees walk out the door without a whimper.  They have let entire departments disappear due to neglect and unfair compensation.  I used to love this company and I had a glimmer of hope when the new president was announced.  No more.
bad,"its can be very rewarding and most days very unpredictable, and you should always be able to know what your going into no mater what day of the week, it is."
bad,Good team members for the most part. Management is lacking and only cares about numbers. Hypocritical and does not involve themselves in the day to day operations.
bad,Once you are hired you can't advance unless your apart of the clique. The hours are not for people who have small children. 13 to 15 hours a day. You can not advance with this company. They only advance their friends and family. No matter whats their education level. No education equals advancement to a higher position if your related to the manager or friends with the manager. The managers are intimidated by people with a higher education. I can only speak for the clinics in Louisiana mainly in the New Orleans Regions.
bad,"There are several different computer programs that you will have to work through.  Sometimes duplicating information.  The office is "
bad,"The workplace is poison, co-workers will unload their work onto you, management plays favorites,company only see's patients as numbers, will drain you emotionally and physically."
bad,"Work Hrs based on pt census, very unstable paycheck. Management is not good, compensation average. Very physical work. Many locations avail across the nation if looking to relocate."
bad,I found that working for this company was far different than others because it was owned by a couple of doctors so things worked differently.  Such as the importance of their employees.
bad,"A typical day at Davita includes organization, verification, and clarification of patient orders, working as a team player while gathering supplies, setting up dialysis machines, and assisting technicians with cannulation during general patient care.  Advanced health assessments are performed and patient needs are adjusted according to assessments.  Continuous collaboration with Physicians, Teammates, Nurses, and Dialysis Technicians to ensure adequate dialysis while providing safe patient care."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,Typical day is exhausting with little compensation and acknowledgement. Patients are great and appreciative of your work. I have been told by my patients that they feel like a family here.
bad,"Davita has changed since I’ve been here . They starting off people working here at 12.90 ! That’s insane considering we’re dealing with blood Bourne pathogens , heb a, b and hiv. They also got rid of the bounuses  davita also has a high turn over rate . My advice . Pay more !"
bad,"I worked at DaVita for 3+ years in People Services, which is DaVita-speak for Human Resources.  I was on a great team, with very smart and nice hard-working people.  I wasn't micro-managed, and I got to work remotely 1 day a week (or more if there was inclement weather).  But then I got sick.  Really sick.  I went out on FMLA for 12 weeks for surgery, recovery, and treatment; and on my 3rd day back to work after exhausting my FMLA, I was let go!  I was told my position was being eliminated due to ""no work for me to do"".  I was basically fighting for my life going through cancer treatments, while still being productive for DaVita; and poof!  My job was gone.  This is a HEALTHCARE company!!  My team was mortified.  As was I.  And while I did draw a token severance package, they still took away my source of solid income."
bad,"Not a good company to work for.  They work you like a farm animal while offering low compensation to you.  They are not fair to the employees who work hard.  They reward and compensate to their favorites only. I never received a yearly review from my supervisor and was told I could not get a raise.  Also, I enrolled in classes with permission from the nurse manager only to find out last minute that they are supposedly short handed and need me on the days I was supposed to be in school working towards a nursing degree.  They do not care if you have a family and need to take care of small children when they are sick.  The nurse manager called me at home harassing me and threatening my job because I had to call out the night before do to my 5yr old falling sick."
bad,It’s ok if you don’t mind being just a dialysis technician for the rest of the your life. They have a very high turnover rate. The only way to be heard is to literally call People Services. Then you’re quietly penalized for that. Won’t write you up but start picking at every little thing. Incompetent FA’s and Group FA’s. The good ones clinics are full. The techs basically run the clinic so apply if you don’t like structure
bad,Davita could be a good company to work for if the pay was better. They expect hard work for low pay. For anyone that has worked or seen a dialysis clinic PCT's bust their butt! For a medical facility the medical benefits are expensive. I worked usually between 10-13 hour shifts with just me and a nurse.
bad,"Davita has a good star program and you can work three 12s as a tech. Davita starts you off with a low pay rate and it takes forever to get a decent raise, you will run into terrible Facility Administrators.  These FAs don’t fight for you well some at least, the benefits are terrible might as well get covered CA. The turn around for employees are high and it takes forever to replace someone and that’s when the short staffing comes into place and your over worked!!!"
bad,"Pros:"
bad,Nothing good to say really. I definitely don’t feel valued by the company. The company would rather hire a new inexperienced person than keep their experienced employees.
bad,The company as a whole tries way too hard they are always reaching out trying to get me to come back even though I’ve told them countless times I’m not going back. Also they don’t respect privacy my hr called my emergency contact to see why I was gone when I called in. They treat patients like lab rats in my opinion I feel like their values and missions should shift to privacy as well as being one for all.
bad,They made me a job offer and rescinded it 10 minutes later citing  that they got confused re: how many positions they really had open. Unprofessional.
bad,DaVita Started off as a good clinic at first then it seemed they started to worry more about hours and less about the patients and started to cut hours witch made it severely unsafe for the patients and staff.The pay dose not compensate for all the work you have to due.The clinical coordinator was very rude and disrespectful to the patients and the facility administrator did nothing about it. My motto is treating people the way you want to be treated and that’s not how it was done.I will not refer anyone to work there and I will not tell any new patients to go there either.I hope they will revamp there ethics and make it for the patients again.
bad,You work long hours at DaVita. People are nice but untrustworthy. Be prepared to have harsh work conditions. Expected to perform tasks other than your assigned work duties.
bad,"All I can say is; do it because you love the work, not the money. "
bad,"Working for Davita is a challenge because of long hours making hard to spend home time or study.  The pay is not where I feel it should be.  Give us our bonuses back,"
bad,"I loved taking care of the patients. I found this job to be very self satisfying, despite working 10-12 hr. shifts. The doctor's and nurses were very thoughtful and compassionate. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the facility administrators (except the 2nd one). The work load was far from balanced, and we were constantly plagued with call offs, no shows, or tardiness. And yet there was very little repercussions for theses infractions. Nurses having to be techs happened on a daily basis. The last straw was when they told me to ""pass"" dialyzers that had sat for more than 72 hours. Not only is this unsafe for the patients, but a direct violation of company policy. I notified the medical director, who agreed with me. New dialyzers were reissued. I was terminated for insubordination about a month later.  I know in my heart I did the right thing."
bad,"Love dialysis, have worked with other non Davita clinics, pace was the same. Biggest difference is, managers had clinical experience and I didn't feel like my license is in jeopardy everyday I go to work. . Have lost a lot of good caring and knowledgable staff due to management. Feel like non clinical manager doesn't understand /care that stress level of licensed staff is elevated needllessly because patients have other co-morbidites and not just kidney failure. "
bad,The typical day at work was very stressful by liaising with the hospitals and staffing. Assuring staffing was appropriate. Managing productivity and repair and maintance.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,Patients and job were wonderful but lacked management and teamwork.  Short handed on a daily basis and never knew if clinic would open throughout the davita company.
bad,It becomes monotonous. I feel that I have exhausted all learning opportunities in Davita at this time. I am ready to move into a new position with opportunity for advancement.
bad,Working with the patients is very fulfilling. The day is very busy and never able to really plan your day out because things come up unexpectedly. The local team is good to work with.
bad,"Davita is a fine place to work. However, when a company that focuses itself on wanting to please the co-workers instead of meeting the end goal (which is delivering the patients their prescriptions ASAP), anything good the company does for its employees will fail."
bad,"Davita itself is not a bad company to work for. The patients for the most part were wonderful, friendly and I loved spending time with them. However, pay is terrible and the majority of the employees I worked with were downright HORRIBLE and made it impossible to enjoy work. The boss was very friendly but was a terrible boss, didn't know a thing about dialysis."
bad,"At DaVita, they have horrid insurance and low pay, but they think throwing a party will make you forget that. They expect you to work 24/7 and weekends if you want to get ahead."
bad,Davita has a very odd culture that is difficult to assimilate.  Very poor as far as technology and there is a constant shift in how they want to maintain their business.
bad,"Excited about working there until I transferred to Houston location, unfair training, rushed in training felt as though I would jeopardize license and future."
bad,"Most enjoyable part is the team i was on, we really are one for all, all for one. that is all i have to say about this company.  If you are going to work with this company learn they will teach you and apply it to a better paying company."
bad,"Extremely Stressful.  Doctors are difficult to work for and with. Staff is rude and lazy."
bad,Clinic opens very early.  The day becomes a production kind of treatments. It becomes a rush to move patients through shift change.  The company doesn't care about short staffed clinics.  An RN needs RN be there to sign off on treatments.  Very robotic work and patients are usually not compliant with their diets.
bad,"Poor management, and leadership.  A major Kool-Aide company, almost cult like.  IT department is very silo, and it takes week to get any simple request complete."
bad,"Poor upper management.  FA, Regional Director and People Services are very corrupted! Lack of professionalism.  There was no work life/balance. Favoritism plays a big role at Davita."
bad,"A place to work that wants you to love your job so much that they send you to Denver or a weekend upon being hired to ""drink the Kool-Aid"". Everyone here acts as though the other employees are their family, even staying afterhours for happy hours ONSITE, in which they get drunk and act inappropriately in the office. Managers participate in this behavior."
bad,"Managing the dialysis treatments for 3 shifts of patients, 3 days a week, performing daily pre & post treatment assessments and adjusting the treatment parameters accordingly."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,".Work experience very enjoyable. Good team work with staff. Management staff was very supportive and available. Able to work in several areas kept position interesting ."
bad,"Good teammates, Goal-setting encouraged and also Encouraged advancement, Thoughtful annual reviews. The most enjoyable part of the job is people to work with."
bad,"They state that they want you to have a work life balance, but that is not the case, they continually add more to your plate, without taking tasks away.  You work a lot of long hours and continuous days."
bad,"The culture of the organization looks great on paper, but I never saw it in my area. The organization is very reactive, and senior leadership was very lacking. They have great training programs established, but leadership does not utilize these programs. Production comes before people in terms of proper staffing ratios."
bad,"Great coworkers, lots of intelligent people, cutting edge exploration in integrated health care, poor management and advocacy.  Lots of lip service.  In spite of all the great culture investments, at the end of the day, the singular value is GSD (Get Stuff Done), at the expense of all the other values."
bad,A typical day at work is busy busy busy.  I have learned almost all aspects of the company from budgeting to patient care.  The hardest part of the job is numerous dead lines.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with.
bad,"Always worked short of help"
bad,Working at the corporate office for DaVita Dialysis is both challenging and rewarding. An average day is reviewing and verifying patients insurance eligibility and coverage to delegate the correct billing for the patient's. A day to day motto is getting it correct the first time as quality is over quantity. The hardest part of this job is knowing that you are working for the customer and it is enjoyable because at the end of the day it is my job to reduce fractions for the correct billing processes for the patient.
bad,Now that I know more about Healthcare industry I know they pay next to nothing for what they expect. We would work a ton of overtime at end of month to close the books. Then management would make sure that we didn't actually get paid for any overtime by forcing us all to leave early on the next day they could. Management was able to ensure we didn't actually get paid for any of it as OT this way. Completely ridiculous and not worth it for the hourly they pay.
bad,"I would never go back. Pay is wack compared to what you do. The nurses made you feel low and they will work you to DEATH! Dialysis is a hard job even harder for the patient that have to be there. It was about time there. Get them off, get them out is all they cared about. They'll shorten the staff just to keep budget. Work the ones who are there even harder. Management was okay. They always got us food but it didn't cover feeling like a slave."
bad,"Very poor work life balance"
bad,ineffective directors put in place. This company hired a fraud for a director position. This person then discriminated against me. This person expected me to drive teammates to work instead of hold them accountable for attendance. He allowed them to personally text him to complain. He undermined my management every chance he could. I was with the company ten years. But yet he was allowed to make decisions.
bad,I feel like during my interview I was given false hope on the job description. Once actually working in the position I realized the company relies heavily on the social worker but the social worker gets nothing in return. The pay is great but it comes with a major cost and is not worth the stress. There are no CEU opportunities like other disciplines. It feels as if you are working multiple jobs at once. Not worth it. Some FAs treat you as if you are their personal secretary and not a licensed clinician.
bad,Focus on fun - lots of activities for teammates. High turnover rate due to low pay and difficulty moving up within company. Good starting job as there are many opportunities to improve excel/analytical skills. Not a career.
bad,"As a SW I loved interacting with patients.  My nursing and tech colleagues were wonderful and knowledgeable and we worked as a team.  Management was terrible.  Constantly changing, no transparancy, punitive, and micromanaging.  Many had no healthcare or patient care experience and were more interested climbing the ladder at their subordinate's expense that staff and patient care.  They lose good staff and many patients as a result.  My mental health improved significantly once I left and I am trusted to execute my duties."
bad,No Room for growth! Management rewards slackers. People are chosen for promotion based on who likes you not on your abilities. Dedicated hardworking employees are not rewarded only given more work and responsibilities.
bad,Some of the nurses act like techs are beneath them. Nurses can be rude to patients who addresses their concerns with management.  The pay is too low for all the work one has to do.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"No words are enough to express my frustrations during my time with DaVita. As a scheduling team member for over 100 nurses and 30 hospitals, the compensation was never enough for the trouble.The management seemed to change regularly and the upbeat culture they tried to promote to the staff did not match the actual operation. I would recommend this as a good place to work if you are willing to sacrifice time from your life to improve your resume."
bad,Poor upper level management that is overly focused on budget than providing care for patients or creating an enjoyable work environment. DaVita is a good stepping stone to gain experience.
bad,"management pitted each clinic against each other vs numbers yet never understood the reasons why certain numbers might occur in each area. Then they would try and talk the TEAM angle but we always knew who was the favorite, yet the rest of the team never got support to raise our numbers. Horrible toxic place to work."
bad,"The usual day starts at 8 am till 6pm , 6 days a week. The work load is starting with interaction with patients and clinical staff, discussion of unusual occurrences and patients complains. Daily addressing and resolving issue with  staff shortage. There is not adequate staff coverage for patients on dialysis. Daily meeting with MD, CNM;RD and MSW. Preparation for daily reports and statistics of the Center. "
bad,Loved I was helping people with getting there  dialysis paid for. We had fun days at work where the floor would get together and play games. I got to do a lot of community service work
bad,The workplace culture of Davita is a positive environment but there's not much opportunity for advancement within the company. Its a good entry level job but difficult to advance within the company
bad,"As an entity the company is amazing but at our smaller facility the manager is rude, plays favorites and only disciplines certain employees."
bad,"I did not find this job challenging at all, and was mostly bored.  They failed to utilize my skills efficiently.  Management was not very good as they didn't have much of a vision or drive to improve company."
bad,"working for Davita is very challenging , its very hard to advance in this company , Its hard to get a raise, and the hours are terrible. Think twice about working for this company . Horrible management, STAFF IS RUDE AND NASTY TO PATIENTS ."
bad,To many stats to follow and not enough care toward the patients. There is too much concentration on the numbers and want to fit patients in a box so the companies numbers look better.
bad,big turnover rate and long work days and underappreciated. The nursing staff and management are very critical of the PCT staff for as understaffed as they are!
bad,For Managers  very stressful and no job security. Wether you remain or are terminated depends on if your manager likes you and not at all on your performance.
bad,"The overall culture is great, the benefits are excellent, the higher management is excellent; however, immediate management is poor, and protocols are not followed."
bad,"Since Davita took over CSHP it has gone downhill dramatically. Employees are overworked and underpaid. Employees are leaving at an alarming rate. Employees are very stressed and the only answer we ever get is ""its being looked at.""The only good thing about the job is the patients."
bad,"It's a very strenuous job, a lot of long hours, but very rewarding job!!! You either hate it or love it no in between!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you don't like early morning and long periods of standing this aint the job for you"
bad,"Davita could be a great place to work if only they would listen to their Facility Administrators and RNs.  Davita brings in people with MBAs to run their clinics and these people have NO idea what it's like to actually work on the floor and take care of their patients."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Great potential, but there is high turnover and much dis-satisfaction."
bad,"Davita intentionally under-staffs.  If you are a clinical coordinator, be prepared to work the floor as an RN and PCT half the week. Davita is always trying to squeeze the dollar at the patient's expense, so you will be sending PCTs home and taking their patients off. Years ago, Davita had great parties for the patients and holiday events - no more. They have a great training system if you are lucky enough to use it. The turnover in the Metroplex has been massive, but somehow they keep finding nurses. Sadly the patients pay the price. Its too bad Davita does not live up to the core values they started with."
bad,"Walked in one day expecting to meet with management to continue my training as I had only been there 6 months and was told I was being laid off. Shocking. They break state and federal laws by dispensing medications without proper licenses and pick and choose which policies and procedures to follow. "
bad,"The shifts specified on the application do not match up with the amount of time you spend working. The shifts are more like 16 hours, on your feet all day, rushing to get the next shift of patients on, and management sucks. Communication is off and they expect you to live and breathe DaVita. Always understaffed and unorganized."
bad,"This facility is great for patient care and meeting cooperate initiatives. The management is poor and tyrannical. People in upper management can be manipulative. Your best is never enough and then more is expected with very little compensation or recognition. Because they have run through key members of their core staff, know your worth and ask for more money upon offer. They will need you!"
bad,"Use you thin. Takes advantage of you."
bad,"Core values and lingo make DaVita sound fantastic.  Management often has little clinical experience so is out of touch with the issues their clinical teams experience.  Hours can be long (15+ hour days) and pay is low considering the amount of responsibility and workload they give you.  Clinics often operate short staffed, especially during the summer.  This makes a hard job even more stressful and exhausting.  Consequently, there is high staff turnover in many clinics.  The facility administrator can truly ""make or break"" a clinic so if you get one who is sympathetic and understanding, be grateful.  Although some patients can be difficult, the patients who truly appreciate you help make the job worthwhile and fulfilling.  This can be a good place to break into the healthcare industry as they often provide on the job, paid training but is questionable when it comes to being fulfilling and promoting a good work/life balance."
bad,"In my current roll, Revenue Operations, there is little room for human error. Having only been w/ the company five months they seem to expect me to operate at the same rate as those that have been in the same position for years. When you are overwhelmed w/ work and can't manage what is already on your plate, you can be assured that they will give you more. When you meet expectations they reward you by saying that its not enough and that you should be doing more. Managers are detached from the reality of those that sit in the cubicles and generate billions for the company. Their cult like approach may intrigue many but be assured that they will not reward you unless you truly gobble the BS and stick it out for years. Only then, providing office politics swing your direction, might you have the opportunity to waste years in middle management and strive to be ""The greatest dialysis company in the world"". Translation, the most profitable. The bottom line is the word folks. Just another faceless American Corporation."
bad,"Pros:  Good pay, nice staff, bonuses (all about productivity and numbers..)"
bad,"A cultish type atmosphere. Lets pretend to be about family, being a village, until you make to much money or management changes, (which it does often!) then on Monday morning....people are suddenly gone! Don't ask questions, just be lucky your still there! The Deland area is its own small village, hugely political and recycling of relationships amongst the people being the role models...almost in an incestuous way!....not sure it speaks for the entire company. I would like to think not."
bad,"Started as a staff nurse, then charge nurse it was a great experience for that first year my clinic was good and techs were awesome decided i wanted to further my education and learn Peritoneal dialysis and work in the acute setting...on call 24/7 for acute PD program became disenchanted with all the call but loved the job otherwise.....ultimately was given a position of clinical nurse manager out of state (after I paid my own relo) then was not paid salary that was offered because it took too long for my nursing license to come through, the management assumed I applied for license before transfer mind you I was working long hours up until the day before I left...  so I was given the choice by HR and my manager at the time of returning to my previous position out-of-state until I received license then return....who does that?! I ended up moving back worked for old manager for awhile then left,,,she is gone too. Davita in the clinical setting (can't speak for corporate but I hear they are living it up off our backs) started out with a great culture, still has great training online but it really has become blurred by greed....so sad."
bad,the benefits is what what made the day worth it the jib was at times stressful and u didnt know what was goin to happen next\
bad,"I like the fact that I have gained a lot of experience with my current employer. Working on the Helpdesk has exposed me to a lot of different issues and experience is very valuable to me. What I find most difficult is the constant change in processes and the lack of communication of those new processes. There is also not always a great relationship between the Help Desk and other departments within the Information Technology group. I excel at customer service so I most enjoy assisting my fellow employees when they call in for help. I like working with my fellow Help Desk analysts. It is a great environment to work in. However I think after 10 years it is time to move onto another company with fresh opportunities. It can be very difficult to advance from the Help Desk at times. I am looking to expand on my experiences, learn new things but at the sametime be in a position that will allow me to utilize my superior customer service skills."
bad,"The challenge was the caseload as a social worker--expected to work with over 150+ plus patients is madness! Burnt out so quickly even when I asked for help I never received it just to manage the workload (assessments, KDQOLs, PHQs, case management work, patient complaints/behavioral conflicts, interim Admin Assistant work and more! Felt like the work of 3-4 peoplewas being done for 1 person!) Even the local hospitals don't kill you with the workload! Frankly work/life balance was non-existent as there were phone calls even on days off and before/after work hours from teammates/management (worked over 40 hours a week just to clean up the mess left by previous workers!) PTO was frankly terrible as they lump sick time, PTO and holidays which were taken out of your total balance and if you did not have enough time you did not receive your regular pay."
bad,"Hired for 40 hours and told 3 weeks later I can only get 24. To get more hours I had to travel to other locations far from my home. Upper management is clueless and makes false promises. Go elsewhere. They always cut hours according to ""productivity ratio and balancing the big corporate paychecks on the backs of the workers. Very sad!"
bad,Management was controlling. They did not let you do your job because they were always having meetings about where you are and what are you working on. They did not like it when you brought up issues or questions.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"A typical day at Davita was not like any ordinary place. While most believed in the ONE FOR ALL! 3 Musketeers lifestyle, others just came to work to be there. I did learn all that is needed in the medical billing and collections role for dialysis patients. I grew with the company. Initially, it was all about the patients, but as the company grew, the beliefs of it being the best dialysis company the world had ever seen had gone to the wayside. I found a lot of management playing employees against each other and not being very straight forward. I spent most of my adult life there hoping that it would change. Once you are branded, there was not room for advancement. Bonuses, paid out in June and December, were a joke. .You had to depend on your teammates doing their jobs to get any kind of a bonus. The payouts were less than a half weeks worth of pay. And they considered these a great benefit to have (without matching the 401k, it felt like a slap in the face)"
bad,"DON’T WORK HERE. The clinical coordinators take advantage of the RNs. The schedule is a joke! If you like working lots of hours with no sleep, this is the job for you! The PCTs really run this organization! They are great st what they do. But they don’t get the appreciation they deserve. The on call days are horrible! Expect at least 10-13 a month!  Just work here long enough to get a paycheck to get something else. You have to call off to get consecutive days off then they call you in on your other days off"
bad,"Do not be fooled. Management has no clinical experience and will not think twice about throwing you under the bus.   Management is only concerned about their pay and time off, while making others do their work for them.  Too much time being spent in meetings.  And while they lecture you on managing your time and being mindful of overtime, they have no problem leaving for the day, leaving you with multiple tasks to be completed.  They are negative and are always telling you  what you are doing wrong, yet they do nothing to solve the problem."
bad,"This company was so good to me for so long, but over the past couple of years they took more and more from you.  Our higher-ups took kings Island family day to bonuses away that we all looked forward to, to name a few. My current manager only wants to hire 'certain' people or they had to be great friends of the manger (some family friends of friends). I do not agree to that, favoritism is a big problem at our clinic. FA does best friend pods with her employees that she is very close to, but not with the others.  I was told by HR that personally came to talk to me I was getting special treatment.  After those 2 words were mentioned, that moment I decided I would be looking for another job. The company is great, it all depends on your upper management."
bad,"Most people are drawn in because of their emphasis on culture, but you will soon realize it's all fake and you wonder how most of the leadership team got promoted to their roles. You would almost think incompetency is a requirement. You are expected to do a lot of data analysis, but aren't compensated well for those responsibilities. It's a great stepping-stone job, but not a long-term one, especially in this office where turnover is high."
bad,do not have to be experience can be trained for the pct position.start pay is  $13-14 start but you don't get a full 40 hours might be short 10 hours each week. for the time and pay its not worth whole days spent away from your family
bad,"-Very supportive nurses and PCTs at the field of acute dialysis (excluding office and management). Nurses are even available to answer phone calls from others who need help or troubleshooting for patient care when they are off duty."
bad,"this is a fast paste job.  everyone is very friendly but most of the employees are willing to show you everything you need to know."
bad,"Davita needs to invest in better quality leaders to help organize, and maintain employees.  Little interest in how employees may be feeling with dealing with difficult managers or directors.  Benefits are okay, but not worth the stressful environment."
bad,"Ther is a direct conflict of priorities when it come to cost vs. quality patient care at this company. Above the Regional Operations Dir.postions, leadership appears to be phenomenal. However at the ROD and below; lackluster. It’s costs over care."
bad,"The work location out in Federal way is an awesome building, with kitchenettes, café, gym, showers... all kinds of amenities to provide an awesome work environment. With that being said.. they do not pay staff enough, they have a high turn over rate due to low wages."
bad,Pros! Good way to see if you really want to be a Nurse or not. Cons Be Prepared to Work until you fall out. Company only cares about bonus and not the staff your health will deteriorate.
bad,"Acute and chronic dialysis offers nurses a dynamic and often chaotic role.  Critical care background is imperative for hemodialysis nurses.  "
bad,Decent company to work for. You have to realize each person as well as staff personality  sometimes don't mesh.   Need to be team player learn to put your feeling aside and focus on  your job .
bad,"High school environment, though management and nurses are great.  Overworked, high traffic clinic with too many patients to techs.  "
bad,"Enjoy working with patients, teaching and serving themmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
bad,Great culture however poor work life balance.  Overall I would rate the company a 2 out of 5.  I enjoyed working with the employees
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"Leadership staff will say one thing but then go and do another. Often times you have to ask three or four different people to get the complete story on something. You will never know if you are blacklisted by supervisors or managers unless you catch one of them in a lie and call them on it. Older staff members are very judgmental and try to play political games if you disagree with them and unfortunately, the leadership team doesn't do anything to stop these actions."
bad,All co-workers were great management just let it get out of hand
bad,I really enjoyed working for the company...There were some un friendly people that made it uncomfortable. I still did my job though
bad,Depending on who is your manager. You can really enjoy working at Davita ! If u get a bad manager it will be hard to enjoy work. They don’t pay a lot and require the techs to do so much work.
bad,"The staff makes things so much harder then it should be, I’ve had patients tell me that the staff is the reason they can’t keep good help. Most of staff is very territorial and they try to make it hard for new employees. It’s really a lot to learn and the person they have training everyone purposely tries to confuse you, she doesn’t teach nor go along with what you’ve learned on the computer so you’ll never be on the same page with everything. I could go on about how awful it is to work for this company."
bad,"Nice working environment with the team. However, micro-management was what made me left the company. Treat people the way you want to be treated. Thanks. "
bad,"I want to keep it brief if you are looking to get into an IT role at DaVita you will be promised that but in reality, you will be placed into a customer service role answering anywhere from 50-70 calls a day. You will need to memorize the DaVita script for each call if you do not follow it to a T you will be marked down and disqualified for any opportunities within the company."
bad,"We always had fun , food, and games.. A lot of engagement. Meetings came once a week for an overview of company standings. The hardest part of the job was having adequate help for our work load. The enjoyable part was my teammates."
bad,"great company just need more staff , more then enough room for advancement . small raises but bonus are great. close work environment like a small family or big family depending on clinic."
bad,"My job wasn't permanent it was a contract job through the hospital. Management was not really good, and very hard to get in contact with management. Overall the pay was great, and we traveled all the time."
bad,Davita is a good company for benefits. It's still dialysis there is really nothing great about the hours you work 12-16 hour shifts. you have no personal life. My kids have raised themselves because I work so much. But it can be great working with the different doctors and nurses and learning new things all the time in this field with this company.
bad,Working for Davita sucked the life out of me.  My commitment to the job and the patients seemed to go unnoticed.  The work day was exhausting working greater than 14 hours per day.  If you have no life or family it would be the optimum job because of the commitment needed to care for patients.
bad,"I enjoy the fact that we have our core values, and everyone seems engaged at meetings. The company does instill a good set of moral values, and the benefits appear to be fair compared to other companies."
bad,At Davita we would have these happy hours after work 2-4 times a month where we would relax eat and share great conversation over wine and beers only.
bad,Motoring dialysis machines  during patient treatment. Learning about diabetes and kidney frailer. constantly short staffed and unsafe for patients and employees. I enjoyed spending time with patients.
bad,"Davita prides itself on it's culture, which is great. The problem with the company lies in the inexperienced leadership and the lack of visibility in a lot of the roles. Things change so fast, usually in a negative way, that roles often disappear and many teammates and analysts end up in limbo with no real responsibility and no way to dig themselves out and back into a promotion track."
bad,"This is one of the hardest jobs that I have worked in a while. They care nothing about their nurses, the staff that you are in charge of are rude and disrespectful. I respect everyone for their role but you have pcts that has been there longer than you so therefore they feel that you have no right to tell them anything. The same is for the LPNs."
bad,"With DaVita there is little reward for very difficult work. Dialysis is giving individuals with Renal (Kidney) failure a second chance at life. Unfortunately, there are many individuals who abuse this opportunity and do not follow the strict dietary needs of their new lifestyles. You have many patients who are very demanding and require much attention."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,12-16 hr days.  I learned alot about Renel Disease.  The hardest part of the job was when we would lose a patient.
bad,"poor management, lack of personal accountability, inadequate staffing"
bad,"There definitely isn't any job security, nor will there be room to grown. Just different departments you can jump around to."
bad,"There's two davita cultures; corporate offices and the clinics. Let me assure you, there's a vast difference."
bad,"DaVita is an awful dialysis company. Everything they do is about the bottom line and I think they sacrifice patient care. Every week we would run out of syringes and masks, compromising catheters. Elderly patients, who probably won't be alive much longer, are strong armed into having fistulas placed, and even though that is the best for dialysis, patients nearing their end don't need further surgery, recovery and pain. Techs and nurses are overworked and staffing shortages are always an issue. Management cares about nothing but the profit. The pay is good as are the benefits, however sacrificing my values is worth more than that."
bad,LOW pay for the amount of work we're asked to do. Manage my time and get my work done.
bad,"3:30 clock in, turn on machines, attach Bi-carb, and water. Set up machines, prep dressing changes look over prescriptions. 5:15 bring in patients, stat vitals. An RN at this point would check everything and give the OK to connect patient to machine. Clean the venipuncture site, stick, flush line, attach to machine and then start 4 to 5 hour procedure. Every 30 minutes check vitals and fluids. Prepare for next patient and repeat 3 to 4 times a day. 8:15 clock out."
bad,"I hate this job the pay and work load was not worth  the pay... Always short staff and work hard under pay they didnt treat their employees right."
bad,This company refuses to help its floor nurses and RNs truly be successful. Money outcomes are priority compared to patient care. And as far as paying employees their raises are below minimum and are much lower then the competition. Your managerial team doesn’t support staff that put in way too many hours or listen to suggestions for improvement. Awful
bad,"The job duties I had with Davita were administering the company credit card, helping teammates with their expense reports, and paying the utility bills."
bad,"The company overall was ok, however if you are not a ""fave"" you would not move up. but they are closing down now so I guess that's no longer a problem."
bad,"Long days, fast paced work, short staffed most of the time. NO time given to do documentation, Company motto was great but not followed in the clinics, only at the corporate levels."
bad,The hours combined with the work load is ridiculous.  No teamwork. Everybody is for themselves. Supervisors have their picks. 30 minute lunch breaks. You're constantly moving around. Work at clinic close by your home or you will regret it because of early mornings late evenings.
bad,"Davita does not like to compensate well in wages or benefits. They expect more and more from us, with no incentive.   We're treated like robots/machines vs. a human being. The yearly pay increases are atrocious, with the highest increase being 1.8%.  Now they took away our bonus and replaced it with a 401k.   I was told the bonuses were supposed to compensate for the low yearly wage increase. For having peoples lives in our hands, we're not very well compensated."
bad,"Fast paced, long hours. No work/life balance. Shifts start early in the morning. Tiring. Standing on feet all day. Minimal nursing work, will spend most of your time working as a tech."
bad,Davita is a great place to work. Has many benefits and trains you on the job for some positions. Continuing your education is required to advance to most other positions. It is long hours on your feet as well as very fast paced. It takes a special person to work in the health care field. Just make sure you really know what you are getting into prior to applying for a position.
bad,"The management needs to appreciate their workers and Nurses. Overworked and underpaid. They don't even train you for the position you are supposed to work. "
bad,"a typical day is chaotic and extremely hurried in order to provide optimal healthcare"
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
bad,"The job is hard at Davita but they don't pay well."
bad,"DaVita is good about encouraging their employees to advance professionally and educationally. However, workplaces are lacking discipline, professionalism and effective management."
bad,Only allowed to use the restroom unless an emergency. No room for advancement. Have to use PTO for holidays. No development or growth. Constantly being monitored. Health insurance is outrageous.
bad,"Well known company"
bad,I feel depending on the region you are employed within determines your experice with working for DaVita. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I am getting off. Because the facility is majority women there can be a lot of gossip and drama. The hardest part of the job is losing a patient you have grown to love. I learned very valuable lessons as to how corporate business operate. I would not like to work at this particular facility but DaVita in another state could possibly be great.
bad,"Start day at 3am and work till 6pm most days, took care of eight patients in a day monitoring all aspects like b/p, fluid removal during patients treatments. This company was a great company when I first started but they quit putting patients first, could never keep help so often you worked 6 days a week and many times 16 hour days. Would I go back, never I got into the medical field to help people not treat them like herding cattle."
bad,"DaVita is a stressful place to work. The Monthly Close process of reconciling charges is extremely stressful. However, I learned a lot while I worked there, and for that I am grateful . I worked with a lot of nice people. They always had the best Christmas parties."
bad,"At times when we would fall short from a tech calling in, at times one tech would have to put eight patients on the machines alone, at times nurses wont help because they already have other patients to assest and pass out medications, when ask to FA if coverage was found, we would be told that he or she was working on it and then will lose communication with techs on the floor and would sometimes just leave without finding any coverage. Changes to schedules on techs without any advanced time telling, as well as to patients which then patients will complain to us and the FA about the changes of their on time chairs. FA does not work with teammates to meet their needs as parents outside of work, always says he will do something and never keeps his word on it, constantly need to remind him and at times will ignore."
bad,I used to love working here but now it’s all about the business more than patient care.  Employee safety is not even a thought.  I was threatened twice by a patient and nothing was done when advised social worker or management.  If you can manage balance between life and excessive amount of stress this might be the job for you.
bad,"high stress, high expectations, lots of fixing other people's screw ups, pointless meetings, feeling under appreciated and overworked"
bad,"Davita was a good company at one time but there were a lot of changes not for the best interest of the employees who work there a very stressful job when a manager who is non clinical has no idea how to run the day to day operations she is unfair and puts people in a bad situation, she isn't very organized and this created problems for everyone working under her, She hired people to help her with her job and the administrative assistant did things that she was supposed to do as a manager , The job itself was ok as long as I'm able to work without a lot of distractions I met a lot of good people there and still have lasting freindships  even now."
bad,I really enjoyed the patients at Davita there was several cultures and diversity there. The management was not good. The hardest part of the job was to be on your feet for 10 to 12 hours a day.
bad,A work day in Davita was typically short because it was only an internship. My job was to operate dialysis machines alongside providing basic patient care needs. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing at the end of the day im here simply to help those in need and possibly help save a life.
bad,"setting up dialysis machines, tearing down dialysis machines, taking vital signs, monitoring patients during treatment."
bad,Watch your back because people will blame you for everything then they will fire you for whatever that person said but I loved my patient's. No matter what they played favorites and that part was very discouraging.
bad,typical day was to resolve billing issues with kidney patients.  I constantly learned new areas of the dialysis business. management and co-workers were OK to work with.
bad,"It was a great job until it ended abruptly, without warning. I spent 4 years at DaVita. One day in early October 2019 my team was called in for a meeting with the Director of our lane and told that all of our positions were eliminated due to an IT restructure. Some of the people in the room with me had worked for DaVita for 20+ years. They left that day escorted out of the building by security. "
bad,David a was a very fast pace place to work for with great people to take care of and get cleanliness. I would recommend anyone to work with or for davita
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"the higher up in the staff, is very unprofessional and find it ok to reprimand employees on the treatment floor during turn-over and in front of patients. Also find it ok to fire someone over the phone. "
good,I would not recommend working for this place at all. I am currently in the process of looking for another job. Management is very small minded and does not care about anything.
good,They give good bonus checks along with the atmosphere being friendly most of the time the clinic that I am currently working the F.A. does not micro manage us.
good,It was very long hours and the pay was not really up to par for the physical challenges you had to do each day.  Most days it was almost 16 hour shifts three to four times a week.
good,This company has no loyalty to its employees. I was in nursing school and  the new FA moved me to part time status with the promise that I will get my full time status back when done. That didn't happen. in fact they only gave me 1 day a week. It seems that they were not happy that I finished nursing school.
good,learned anybody without a degree can get hired for my job now
good,They work you like a dog. Management is awful. They don't listen to suggestions.what a hellhole
good,Davita Has it's Pro's and Con's most of the managers at the facilities are great but the management above them are not very supportive of internal promotions
good,Your hours depends on how many patients you have .  Full- time is 30hrs.  If you want 40 hours you have to go to another clinic.  We are always short staffed.
good,"If you do not attend the same church or have worked together previously, you will get no where in the IT department.  Great company but terrible IT management team."
good,"This company use to actually care about teammates and make decisions based on what is the right thing to do...but no more. Upper management is disconnected from the rest of the workforce and only wants ""yes men""."
good,"Senior Managers have no clinical or managerial experience in many geographic locations.  Hired directly from mba programs and do anything possible to make a dollar or name for themselves.  As a result shortcuts in clinics from undue stress placed on facility admins, nurses, techs, social workers."
good,"Difficult to work with upper management staff.   Pct and RN STAFF were a joy to work with.  Unorganized place.  Charting difficult but, could be improved."
good,"Working here was quite an experience, employees are over work and not appreciated at ALL. The more you kill yourself working it's still not good enough for management. They say continue to ""leap"" this company will burn you out if you let them."
good,"Typical day starts very early. Lots of busy time and general prepping for the day and the next day. I learned that I will never work in a field again where my workday depends on the way others perform and/or their work ethics. Management and co-workers had constant, shady deals that always left the loyal and responsible workers to pick up the slack for those who really are not interested in working but need that check. The hardest part of the job was the constant turn over, bias nursing and management, and coworkers who were jealous of those trying to advance. I cannot think of an enjoyable part of my experience with this company."
good,"I have been a RN for 30 years, and my heart is with direct patient care.  I had a wonderful supervisor who mentored me during my time there as I had had minimal supervisory experience.  DaVita does a very good job of assisting one with templates and programs to meet CMS requirements."
good,"Worst job ever...no diversity, over worked and under paid."
good,"You are on-call 24/7 as a Facility Administrator.  Fellow FAs are not team players.  "
good,"Very hard job and want you to work as a ""Village"" but that motto only  looks good in print. Walking the walk and talking the talk is 2 different things. Too much adverse publicity with shareholders and board members. Alot of improprieties within the company, Want no part of it."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Calling on past due claims and rebilled them as necessary. I learned a lot about diaysis and different types of software. When I first started I had a great manager but she went to another position and I got a very bad one. The hardest part of the job was having to learn different types of software every week and still trying to keep up my accounts. My manager didn't like me because I stayed to myself and worked. The most enjoyable part of my job was that no one stood over you while you worked.
good,The company does not follow their core values. The ultinate goal is money. There is too much work to be able to take any time off due to under staffing and unreasonable expectations.
good,The training is fair  but I feel they don’t prepare you adequately.  The hours are very long always short staffed.  They use travelers which is not a great thing.  Advancement is very difficult if your not a Nurse.  Being a PCT  leaves very little opportunity to advance.
good,"The Dialysis Technicians are worked way too many hours per day."
good,This is a nice clinic and great patients. The FA lacks managerial experience and does not communicate well with her staff and patients. A majority of your day can consist of crisis management with the FA or staff members. Beware of lack of management. There are no opportunities for CEUs although they tell you that and social workers are not always respected as professionals at within Davita culture.
good,"I loved the actual job. The culture in the workplace is horrible. there is racism, Favoritism. It is ridiculous. If you're not kissing up to the ""right"" people you are in trouble.  The FA from another clinic sometimes cover there and he is not the nicest person.  there is division in the clinic. Some nurses are lazy."
good,"As an FA you are continually told that you are the CEO of your facility. sad thing is, you really don't have the autonomy to make decisions. Leadership plays with your future to accommodate their hidden agenda. You will be continuously asked to do more, when they will tell you you can say no,they start to push you out."
good,I worked for this company and it was a good job and provided great education. However turn over was high and management was in and out all the time nothing was consistent.
good,"The commute for me was significant and they do not allow work at home days. Way too much management change.  I was hired in for one job and ended up doing something entirely different.  Somewhat a ""boys"" club in IT."
good,"This job was great and had amazing trainers and managers but over the years the company became more interested in money and shareholders. The management went down hill when they stopped promoting from within which led to a very stressful environment.  This job was a huge part of my life for 6 years but the last 2 years were not fun, I even took a pay cut to get out of there."
good,"Typical day of work PMs, repair of equipment and traveling between 4 clinics and 2 hospitals."
good,The mckinney location is in need of new management and better staff.  The day to day keeps you busy and the patients are wonderful
good,"Management doesn't support staff needs.  Over census load with no relief.  Free for all environment, no direction or guidance from management except in the wrong direction."
good,"I worked their 2012-2014 and DaVita was a great place to work as an intern but as soon as you became a employee all the secrets start to unfold.  This is a money hungry company that cares only about the patients making it to treatments to sit on their machines so they can get paid. In Detroit, MI everyone that is hired is related in some sort of way. If you arent related to anyone the staff treats you as an outkast.  The Facility Administrators are sneaky and write you up over petty things that happen a month ago (i.e tardy 2 minutes past 4:35 am (doors dont open until 5:30 am), no leather gymshoes)to keep their files current, also they come to each others clinics to sit in FA/staff meetings as witnesses, messing up your chances of going to another clinic by word of mouth from other FA's.  They all rig there numbers for  high DQI scores.  People Services (Corporate) claims they are here to help PCT's / Nurses with any concerns, but their is no winning against FA's.  They protect them 100% based off the clinics DQI scores and your previous write ups. You see so many techs come and go, and Nurses only fin for themselves.  Its a very unhappy place to work.  Also pressured to work 4 consistent 12 hour shifts because the FA chooses to work short staffed due to the monthly budget. Some care about your work life balance, other FA's dont at all.  Be careful of what clinic you choose to work at, Kresge as well as Schaefer and Detroit West, and Grosse Pointe. No hearsay all facts.  GO TO FRESENIUS!!!  THEY LOVE GETTING DAVITA TECHS."
good,"Enjoyed working with the patients one on one."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Leadership at the labs is a joke now. The newest VP has comes from the IT side & knows nothing about running a lab. The teammates in FLL are never given their due because they are treated as underlings to the Deland lab. People's positions will get ""eliminated"" if they do not comply with executive management. Please know the positions are posted only to CYA because they hire friends at ridiculously high salaries with hardly any related experience. The teammates at the FLL lab never are sure if the lab is closing and relocating. Pay rates in Deland are higher than in FLL and more promotions happen there. Rarely does the leadership team come down except for meetings and that's to say how bad FLL is doing. They still don't have the technology to bring on external clients because the IT team can't seem to make it happen. The management team does not uphold the mission or core values on ANY level! And let's not forget to mention the nepotism and fratenization! It's the who's dating who & are married show!! Last but not least...the people services team is the biggest joke! Some of them actually used to work for & help out all the employees!"
good,"very diapointing, looking for work, if your not in high school the job is your"
good,"I enjoyed the work but the training inrecieved was chaotic because of the frequent turnover of management I felt like there was an actually fabulous culture ,in theory, I was never included."
good,"The culture of Davita has drastically changed since KT has stepped down. I have been with the village for 10 years and the focus has decreased drastically from the focus of actual patient care to more of get your teammates out of the building and meet your labor budget. ""Get your patients in and out of the facility as quickly as possible so that the teammates can get out"" this is why I am choosing to beginning to want to leave."
good,"Long hours.  Low pay in comparison to other companies in business. Don’t take into account previous experience.  Favoritism is prominent in clinics.  Management is horrible.   Corporate is in a completely other state and not readily available or on your side.   Grievances are not taken seriously.  Harassment, bullying, initimidation and threatening are everyday occurrences on behalf of mgt."
good,"Great experience, terrible management. As a nurse I felt good as always knowing I was helping to save lives by giving quality dialysis treatment. On another note management is terrible, dont care about the workers or the patients everything is about numbers. Politics politics politics!!"
good,"Dialysis is a fast pace job.  Everything has to be done in certain time frame which sometimes is hard to achieve but their thing is get it done.  There is no work home balance due to the long hours, when you are off you are too tire to do anything."
good,Typical day at work setting up machines dialyzing patients I've learned to be patient and thankful for skills I have learned over the years . There have been many managers in my time here and for the most part all where very good. it's nice to know that when I go to work I know that I have a supportive manager and teammates. Hardest part of my job is trying to remember and do all the policy and procedures in the short amount of time given for patient care. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my patients leave with a smile and a thank you
good,Not a good place to work very long working days including weekends. Management has a very high turn over rate. Raises are barley nothing after 8 years I may have gotten a total of 4.00 more than my starting rate.
good,"Some of the people I have met , I’m Grateful for meeting, but working @ Davita ,well the clinic I’m currently working in there are Cliques that plot to try and get some teammates Fired. There is no work life Balance, you feel like your job is in jeopardy when your sick so you don’t call out and if you do they really make you feel Worse about it."
good,The main issues I have are management deviation from the core values. Also a lot of the clinics are gringy and need updates and matnice. Need more career advancement
good,"I worked as  a registered nurse , the schedule was really bad , i never know my off day, they need more staff"
good,"Good company mission,  difficult to accomplish all needed as there is extra paperwork or extra places to chart.  Labor hours are not great.  Good workers though.  Company insight is good."
good,"If you are considering Google it first."
good,"Poorly staffed."
good,"Ability to make overtime working 4 or 5 16+ hour days a week. Start very early in the morning (4-5 am) with no guarantee of when you go home. Tiring, extremely long days usually back to back."
good,Salary and compensation package good but facility managers leave a lot to be desired.  STAR members startat a pay rate that took many technicians years to earn their way to.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,This environment is not for everyone. It is very fast-paced and can become stressful. The hours are long: 10-15 hours per day sometimes. Not recommended for ayone who becomes overwhelmed easily.
good,I loved this place at first but the longer i worked there the more i seen the truth. If you are not a favorite then there are a lot of opportunity's that you will be picked over for. The work is a lot reminds you of a 911 call center.
good,My day consisted of multiple incoming calls with new admission placements for dialysis patients.  I learned the beginning and the ending of an admission for a dialysis patient.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to admit a patient that was uninsured or undocumented.  The most enjoyable part of the job is hearing that a patient received a Kidney transplant.
good,not enough people to manage the work.  All too often we have too many upper management people competing for too few many resources and no one is willing to help with bigger issues.  I am cleaning up the mess fom the previous 4 people that had my position.
good,I had a ok work experience. Davita does have bad communication skills. Davita Pcts are a little too much drama. However if you have the right team Davita can be an awsome place to work.
good,"Love the patients, coworkers are ok at certain locations, not as much team work in most locations.  Pay is very low for what a PCT does."
good,"There is very limited support to ensure high quality work and to grow within the organization. "
good,A little too much energy is devoted to camaraderie and not near enough time to doing things correctly to adequately support the business.
good,"This is a very stressful, demanding job that is also rewarding. If you are willing to give it 120% everyday, this is the place for you. If all you have is 100%, I would move on."
good,"Challenging work floor with high energy, positive attitude, on your feet non-stop, monitoring patients during pre and post hemodialysis treatments."
good,"Nice place to work if you just care about helping people in general. I've learned alot about diaylsis in this period of time working for the company. I've learned its who you know and not what you know. Co-workers are not the best to work with, but they come through when there is an emergnecy, so i guess that counts for something. The hardest part of the job is juggling your work and your work alone while having to help the slackers with their work as well."
good,"Davita has a great mission and ideals. The management at the lab is completely incompetent when making decisions. They are also unable to own up to their short comings and reward mediocrity under the guise of performance. "
good,DaVita patients are awesome. Working here started off great. They reel you in with all of these great incentives and promises. Soon things change for the worse.
good,I really enjoyed the relationships that I developed with the patients. The facility staff and patients really form a bond that is very similar to a relationship developed with family.
good,Overall fast great working environment. Long Hours your practically there before the sun is out and leave at dark. Not much opportunity for growth unless you go to school and become an RN or MD.
good,"I would not recommend this as a long-term employer to anyone, and especially not for a Social Worker. The reason they have become to be known as the ""Wal-Mart in Dialysis"" is because:"
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Over working employees for numbers to benefit the company to be funded by the government. Worst place I have ever worked!!!
good,Not an ideal career job. Unorganized training program. Very stressful environment
good,"the clinic I work at is not organize, not enough hours"
good,"if you don't mind hard work and pushing machines around,it's for you. The overall knowledge and experience as a nurse was great and interesting if you can concentrate on nursing and doing a job as tech and nurse and get behind on monthly charting,etc."
good,The pay was terrible at davita for a 10 yrs experienced LVN. The management pushed me to work faster...little care about quality over speed and quantity.
good,Company needs to improve on management style. Management does not provide comfortable employee relation. DAVITA is a company that is designed to take care of self worth rather than employees.
good,Working there is very rewarding however there is no work life balance. The hardest part of the job is making family time. It seems like in their minds work is first and family second.
good,"Being a PCT is a good job short term. You are on your feet nearly the entire 12 hours shift. It is hard to balance going to school and working three -  twelve hour+ shifts if you are a student. The job also does not pay super well so it is hard to appreciate the job in it entirely. However, the patient interaction is great and feeling like your making a difference is also rewarding."
good,Constantly understaffed and you dont receive any help from the nurses. Management is poor and there is absolutely no teamwork. I would recommend working at any other unit.
good,"The staff at the facility I was at were awful. Very clicky. No chance to advance. Pointed out all flaws. Very seldom were told i was doing a good job."
good,There is a serious lack of diversity in the legal department and across the enterprise. Some hold true to the culture and mission and values and some are all talk.
good,I love dialysis !!!! We see the same patients and really try to meet their need as a Nurse. It’s fast pace and makes time go by fast. These patients depend on us to be their kidneys to survive. Con had no management for year. When we finally got a manager all she cared about was budget . She did not make patient priority . She cut staff to minimal hard to get hours. She also didn’t handle staff issues. There would be argument among the techs and LPN. Techs and LPN where not doing there jobs and did not have to answer to anyone. I was a very stressful job.
good,"I been employed with this clinic for 7 1/2 years leaving in November 2017. Like any job you go in there with high hopes however, throughout the years there's been a high turnover rate & still is with this clinic. I loved what I did especially dealing with different people although it was always a sad situation whenever you come to work & find out a patient is deceased. They train you for CCHT position & certification. The hours vary when I was there clinic was open Mon-Sat. Mo-Wed-Fri the clinic opened at 4 until maybe 3:30 4:00 (if your the late tech then you will come in 5am until last patient which you could leave by 7 or 7:30). Tues-Thurs-Sat 5am-until maybe 4pm. Thurs are bleach days so if your the late person you have to bleach the system which could have there almost until 6:30 if there is no more bleach in the system. The clinic was open every holiday except Christmas which we would work on a Sunday to compensate for being closed you get time and a half of course when you have 40hrs or more. This clinic has a generator so while everything is closed due to loose of power we was still open even when we didn't have power at home b/c of the needs of business.The good thing is that for every hour your on the clock you do get paid. I won't go into detail about the Facility Administrator b/c she's no longer there so my distaste for her wouldn't be valid now but, the attitude from some of the people as well as the nurses (some of them was not a team player all they wanted to do was push meds) was out of hand. Maybe the atmosphere is better now..."
good,"Nothing has changed over the years, short staffed, poor training, this is life and death for the clients we serve.  Unfortunate revolving door. No time for family."
good,Pride themselves on promoting from within but that is not the case. They trust me to do the most important job (their words) in the company but they are unwilling to promote me.
good,some teammates may not have went to college to may not want to attend but if they have the know how and skills to advance they should be given the opportunity.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help and develop relationships with the patients seeing the growth and attitude change about dialysis from the beginning.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"At Davita, I work with a great crew. It is a very stressful environment and I feel like there need to be changes made if the company  expects to keep people long term. Sure, sending us away for free training and seminars is great in the beginning but that's not going to keep me! There is a lack of communication between the employees that work in administration and those that work the treatment floor. We work long hard hours with out adequate breaks and there is nowhere close to get a drink of water without leaving the treatment floor and going to the break room!"
good,"What leadership says if incongruent with what is demonstrated in the field.  I believe this organization has many strengths, however, they must understand the prevailing culture at the clinic level to tap into the truth of the organination."
good,Most of the staff at DaVita are contracted temps. Some working as a temp for over 5 years. It is hard to get hired to a permanent position at DaVita. But for the permanent employees it is a great company with lots of benefits and promotes life balance and good health.
good,"Management is great a telling you empty promises. Follow through is terrible."
good,Davita has changed significantly since I began working there 6 years ago.  Most of the management that was there to make it a fun but productive work environment is no longer there.  The focus has changed from patient to profit and the fun culture is almost non-existent.
good,"Great culture/company to work for. Extremely bad management in the Bay City Lights Division of DaVita. Treated poorly and unfairly. Management does not care about employees. Employees are stressed and overworked, and lose family and social time outside of DaVita."
good,"Provide support and information to patients and their families to maximize the psychosocial functioning and"
good,A typical day at DaVita would start with going in and repairing and down machines and to help the staff with anything that they needed from a Biomedical Service Technician. Management has a lot to be desired. The culture with DaVita is mint to be positive however there is always a bad seed in the bunch. The hardest part of my day is trying to be in two different places at one time. I enjoyed some of the people that I worked with. The cared about the patients as well as each other.
good,"Early mornings,long exhausting days, fast paced. So much to do but you are urged to ""hurry up and get off the clock"" by management. I learned the process of dialysis and equipment. High turnover rate, so it is easy to advance. Management lacks experience."
good,"DaVita Acutes isn't a great place to work for a new nursing graduate. Your hours aren't guaranteed if there are no patients you don't work, and there is no end time to your work day."
good,"I had a less than stellar manager. If there was a manager assigned which cared for the staff, this would have been a excellent experience. Instead, a low level nurse was assigned, poor quality was her standard, how unfortunate."
good,DaVita is a great company to work at/for for the intellectual capital involved. I learned a ton at this organization and it really helped make me into a well rounded sales and operations professional.
good,"Hard work with lackluster compensation"
good,"Good company overall, great benefits, nationally recognized, takes care of patients and employees, gets stuff done."
good,I feel for an older African American women with a college educated degree there is not enough opportunity for growth. The cultural in the clinic can sometime be tensed. A happy work environment with opportunity keeps loyal employees.
good,"DaVita is nit a reliable company to work for, you have to know someone to get ahead or have job security. The CEO is a billionaire and chooses to pay experienced employees at a low rate and things giving a small bonus a year will make up for it. "
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"The employees below the manager level are usually good. The manager and above crowd not so much. Very disrespectful and tend to treat their ""teammates"" as step children. The work environment has it ups and downs but since Jan. 2015, it seems if the company has went downhill. Maybe the medical side is different than the ""support"" side"
good,"Great coworkers, pay was well below average and they work you 16 hours a day sometime 6 days a week strait. There is no way to move up in the company unless you have a RN behind your name. Besides low pay some FA`s are great at what they do and others don't not need to be in that job role at all. Loved working with my patients and coworkers."
good,"A typical day at work is just like any other day. We have alot of work to do at short deadlines. I actually learned alot bby teaching my self. The training at Davita is okay but hard to catch on, because your not doing hands on things. The management is okay, everyone is not on the same page. The job would be better if we got paid more for all the work that we do."
good,"Loved the work and the clients I was able to provide care for. This is a early morning till late in the day kinda job that was often  so fast paced, lunches seemed like a benefit."
good,"The hardest part of the job is managing work life balance.  Would like to have had better upper management and support from them.  Lack of communication was a problem.  Loved the job, but demands were getting to be unreasonable. "
good,"Please, if you are ethical, honest, drama free, do not go to this company. There is managers who dont know how to manage. They will use you for your knowledge and take all the credit like they did the work themselves and get bonuses for your ideas. I hate that you are made to feel like, if you do not participate in the activities, you are an outsider. Homeroom meeting 3 times a week suck. Stupid cheers, they spend money on everything else but what's important, the employees."
good,"People working there are fun to work with, but the management was horrible."
good,"Bottomline, nepotism, don't make issues with the wrong person. Very retaliatory. Patient deserve more than greedy, uneducated management"
good,loved helping the patents grow close to them. leaned alot about the dailysis and how important it is for a person on dailysis. co workers were more fend for your self and only do what they need to do. mangement was more like a dictatorship their way or the highway and put the blame on you. the hardest part of the job was the hours 14-17 hour work days alot of time away from family.
good,I have learned a lot but I am ready to further my new skills as a medical assistant
good,*no praise for good work
good,"State of the Art operation, Brand New Location with top notch automated line, but lacks the expertise and know how which make for a stressful environment, and a high employee turnover rate"
good,"My typical work day at DaVita was running around to make sure all our patients first and most were taken care of.  I also took care of all the training, scheduling, inventory, ordering and front office work.  There was not enough time in the day for everything.  Communication was by text.  I did not like that.  Its not hard to pick up a phone and call to go over duties that need to be discussed.  You can't just tell one person when you are working as a TEAM!  This all happened in the last year of working there.  When I first started this job it was very challenging and awarding.  The FA at the time was awesome.  She was always there and willing to help no matter what."
good,Great place for entry level experience. Company will hire from within. Very  long work day. Most have reliable transportation and child care. Plenty of overtime available.
good,"Had to start the first patient at 5:30 a.m. would get off at 5 p.m. It's alot of blood to deal with ,but overall the patients made the job enjoyable. The admin showed favoritism towards his employees."
good,Continuously busy and fast paced and lots of repetition. Hours vary dependent upon clinic. Patient rotation is difficult at times if an issue is encountered.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Overall a good company but they only promote people with masters and Ivy League grads. Most frustrating part of this company is that they are inconsistent with paying fair value to people. They give salaries based on subjectivity rather than objectivity.
good,Hard to get raises.. The more u make the more likely you will get replaced... Management always changing.. Poor communication with employees..  High stress job..
good,Closed Phase 1 Units due to reorganization.  Several Reorganization in the 2 years I was onboard.  The people were great to work with but their customer base was no there for t he need to have a Phase I clinical Research Units
good,The company has a great concept of how it should work.  The money takes with management at the top.  Salaries are not competitive and they fight really hared to unions out.
good,The corporate mantra is all about team work and caring about the team but the further you get away from Colorado the less this is evident. It is a good company to work for as long as you remember that it is a for profit company. Simply  put don't drink the kool aide
good,DaVita is a company that is starting to disappoint me. I don't feel safe working on the floor with such a tight time to take off and put on patients. I don't have time to interact with patients without cutting them off. It is getting more and more unsafe...
good,Fast Paced GSD environment.  We work hard and play hard.  There is always something changing or happening.  They care about the people who work here and strive to make communities better.
good,I worked at DaVita as a Senior Software Engineer. They had one Senior Software Engineer that yelled and screamed at his subordinates and the management wanted me to act the same way. I am not that person and because of that I resigned.
good,"Working at this particular clinic is very stressful, not compensated well, manager has favoritism. Inspite of everything, I was able to manage to be a very reliable and very competent employee"
good,Davita Dialysis is a demanding place to work with long hours. Clinics are often understaffed with a lot of pressure to get patients in and out at a pace that is sometimes not safe for patients.
good,The company provides many opportunities to learn and grow your skillset. You can do that from training provided as well as shadowing various teams and teammates or through a mentor.
good,"THis job was awesome at first they drive you and give you all hours asked for. After a while I worked 16 hour shifts 3 days a week, And was not approved a scheduled when I tried furthering my education. So I left that job mutually."
good,They expect way to much of their staff and the hours are terrible  there is no help nurses are expected to do the job of technicians.  unable to get job done in a timely order due to outside factors that can not be avoided
good,Working for Davita was a great opportunity but sometimes depending on the region you work in it can be like going to drama class in high school. Sometimes advancing in your career can be about who you know. There are great opportunities but every job has its demons.
good,"Taking care of patients in a difficult process of their life for 4 hours or more sometimes at a time. The most enjoyable part is being able to interact with patients and comfort them,"
good,"Poor management, don't care about employees and don't want to  listen to staffs' concerns or well being. They sugar coat everything. "
good,"It's very busy and fast paced. There's no work, life balance. Management is really trying to make the culture and atmosphere better. Some patients can be verbally abusive. Many patients appreciate what we do for them."
good,"fast paced, quick advancement, difficult training period, nurses, doctors, patients, dialysis, hospital, vendor relations, freedom, autonomy, long days"
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Manager was biased, showed favorites, Co-workers ok some lazy. Manager didn’t care about lower staff members. Discrimination against people and Tremonation of people they don’t like unfair."
good,Had no authority and manager came in at 1200 (noon) and had no people skills; chose to hide in office.  She wanted full control and accepted no blame.
good,"Your day consists of taking care of patients. You clean the machine and chair, prepare the dialysis machine. Connect the patient for their treatment and monitor their vitals. You work closely with a nurse to ensure proper treatment is provided."
good,"Lack of work life balance, low paying salary, nice culture but dependent upon the manager of the team. A place to learn and develop new skills but lack of room for advancement outside of certain departments."
good,Depends on your manger and the clinic you work if you will have a positive experience. Job training for biomeds is not adequate. The expectations are unreasonable. The work/life balance is not good so turnover is high.
good,"If you like fighting fires and getting paid under market for your skills, then DaVita is a great place to work. The culture resembles that of a cult as well."
good,"Pay is beneath the national average of what Certified technicians."
good,"The company talks about work balance, but when you really need true balance you take leave of absence , return to work you are let go."
good,Management needs some kind of SOP and trainers available to new employees. More trainers are needed to assist new techs and be available for evaluations.
good,poor upper management especially the kooky CEO... the company definitely is for profit and not for patient care and safety. management lets the lazy be lazy because their afraid of confrontation
good,"Davita is a good job to work for, I like what dialysis is about however, management could use some improvement. I am still learning what it is to be a dialysis technician. The hardest part of the job is trying to work with the time frame we are given in between patients, the most enjoyable part of the job for me personally is knowing that i'm there to help people live longer"
good,Plenty of work to be done but very much routine everyday.  No advancement unless already in management.  Too much micromanagement and not enough taking employees concerns into consideration
good,Over all it is a good company. However pay is too low for what is needed from the Dialysis Technicians. Typical work day is a 14-16 hour day. Documentation on vitals and over all health of the patient. The most enjoyable part of the job is giving life back to the patients. The hardest part of the job is trying to meet the needs of every single person.
good,Davita is an ok Company. It is not the best company to work for. It will never be a people's company. Lots of lots of work with not much pay practices as well as compensation.
good,"I believe the overall company is a great place, the center I worked for however was not. They lied about hours, lie about procedures, and couldn't have a schedule out until the FRIDAY before the new MONDAY shift; two days ahead of time you would have an idea and by Tuesday it was switching already. Very inconsistent."
good,Davita is a large corporation that I feel doesn't have their employees best interest. There wasn't enough teamwork and communication between employees and administration. I enjoyed the interaction with the patients very much. Sometimes there was tension between coworkers that could've been resolved with some conflict resolution. There wasn't a lot of opportunities to advance in the company.
good,"Travel to newly acquired facility with feet on the ground running.  I was either home working on reports or out of state. Collected all data needed to train teammates on DaVita software, policy and procedures and operations.  Set up all aspects of dialysis operating systems, from water systems through state inspection.  Changed all vendors and input purchasing policy.  The hardest part of the job was the newly acquired teammates were resistant to change and travel was for weeks at a time.  The enjoyable part of the job was being satisfied that the teammates could function upon completion of training."
good,"Opportunity to make a lot if desired to work long hours, a lot of overtime available. The schedule is very unstable, not knowing when you will get to go home"
good,"Company is good for advancement however, I did not get needed support from immediate supervisor or regional director."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Company doesn't offer much opportunity for room to grow in the Tallahassee area due to lack of competition. The most enjoyable part of the job is the quality care provided to the patients and the strong support system of the teammates involved in their care.
good,Too many managers make getting any project done difficult. Also lines of communication between director employee is to strenuous. This IT department seriously needs a vision in one direction instead of competing tech.
good,The clinic I worked at was understaffed and  had poor management.I would not recommend this company to work for.I loved my co workers they were some of the most hard working medical staff I've ever meet and  I enjoyed seeing many of patients daily .
good,They talk about life work balance but they do not enforce it. Get prepared to work long hours of 50 to 70 hours a week. When moving to another position they will not increase the salary much to compared to looking at another company. No room for growth.
good,Davita as a company is fine. The people that work at the Orlando location make it hard to work there. It is too much complaining and it is very petty there.
good,"DaVita is a decent company to work for.  They promote growth if you're interesting in moving within the company.  They tend to favor teammates with degrees, but are willing to help you obtain one through their education reimbursement."
good,Davita is a good place to work. all staff and Patients are very friendly.i was a technician in this company for a year and i didnt get an opportunity to work when i got my RN license .then they rehired me as a per-diem which was a great achievement for me.
good,"Overall, I enjoy working at Davita. I hear the insurance is awful though. My facility administrator is great, but she has a lot of responsibility running two clinics and the stresses of her job sometimes come through in her attitude."
good,Davita should compensate their employees with raises that match their experience in dialysis and the number of years with the same company.
good,I have worked here for 1 and a half year and you should make your investigations before coming. Someone said in his review: You will work until you drop... I can't say more than this.
good,Working in dialysis is fast paced and accompanied by long work days that start very early and end very late. It can also be very stressful at times. I had to learn to overcome these roadblocks to be successful. I've had good  and not so good management. It's been my first nursing job and I now feel it is time to look for new challenges and allow my nursing skills to grow. Overall I feel it's been a worthwhile experience.
good,"Long hours, great coworkers except for management. Management and team where not on the same page which made the job hard and difficult to do at times.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with co-workers and patients."
good,"Working at Davita can be complicated, this company does not allow advancement to those with Administration Degrees. They only advance individuals who have attained a Nursing RN Degree. I worked for them for 12 years and I was not able to advance. Management is unprofessional towards staff members. The work hours are long and can drain an individual."
good,"A typical day at work was non-stop on your feet for 12hrs.  Very fast paced which is why I am now so organized and efficient in my work to stay on task.  There was very little involvement from the manager.  If there were any issues among teammates, we were expected to solve the issues ourselves which helped us all work together very well most of the time.  The hardest part of the job was being pulled in so many directions on a daily basis, but expected to make NO MISTAKES in any area of the job.  This did help us work together to double check each other's work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having those patients who saw EVERYTHING that we did and showed us gratitude and thanks for our hard work.  After all, the patients were who we were there for in the first place."
good,Management HATES for you to go back to school and improve/ educate yourself!!!
good,"Mixing chemical and cleaning of filtration systems for dialysis, very busy and long days. keeping up with paper work and documentation along with keeping chemicals mixed for the dialysis machines. Seeing the patients leave happy and healthy was a big Plus."
good,"this job involved caring for patients receiving dialysis, which was a great experience for me, this job really required team work"
good,"The company does provide opportunity for personal growth, but allows for very little advancement within the company."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"A typical day short staff,you got some staff that work together and some that dont,poor management in Montgomery ,Prattville ,and Elmore County,if you talk to your mgr., the other knows and also other teammates,and they give positions to who ever they want to and give them the job before it post.The hardest part of thejob is getting up at 3:00 in the am.and poor mqanagement"
good,"A typical day at work would be starting at 4:30am, check my assignments, look what patients i have for the day, set up my four dialysis machines, put patients on dialysis machines, monitor patients on dialysis machines, finish treatments, and on with next patient shifts."
good,"I am dedicated full of integrity. I strive for service excellence,compassion in any job duties i am working on."
good,"Overall a good company for someone that is starting out in the workforce. However, Davita is notorious for not paying their employees anything. They overwork and underpay. They tell you to take one for the team and hock the ""village"" mentality in your face. You have no chance of moving up unless you are really buddy buddy with management, or you leave the company and get hired back."
good,Trying to buid the infrastructure. Technology is way behind innovation of todays market.
good,I loved the people I worked with here but had a micro-manager that was remotely located. Pay was decent.
good,"Your schedule depends on whether or not someone else wants hours. Work with people who complain, A LOT. Company is more concerned with numbers instead of its patients."
good,"I feel DaVita is a ok company.  I have been there a very long time and really have never felt very included since I work part time. Also when they ask for feedback I wish the upper management would actually listen instead of blow off suggestions. I have filled out many and just don't think they'll worth my time anymore.  I wish they could offer better options for part time nursing so work/family life could be a better fit.  I enjoy all the patients and experiences that I have known over the years and that alone is my greatest enjoyment.  It's very fast paced and super early hours for a nurse who has a family and has to function after work. I wish they could have spilt shifts for nursing so the day isn't so long. My last manager is really sweet.  I wish I could have had her in the beginning of my career, but I feel I need a change and they don't have anything to offer me at this time."
good,The salary can be competitive. So be prepared to negotiate and do not set the bar too low it will be hard to move up after that.  As a social worker there is some room for growth and set boundaries do not take on more patient then allowed by DOH.
good,This job is pretty hard for only $16-17 an hour starting. The 12 hour days 3 times a week suck but I guess it was nice having tues and Thursday off. I would not work here again. Pharmacy techs and Dialysis techs are way underpaid for the stress and responsibilities of the job.
good,The job as a pct at Davita is great. Great patients and a few good co workers. How ever at this company I have had my pay checks messed up more in my one year here than my whole working experience. I have been dealing with another co worker treating me very poorly and stealing from me. Management does nothing when they are told about it. They do not care.
good,"Patients are great to work with, facilities run different. You have to find your fit. The patient's make you want to come to work. Patients are the reason you come to work"
good,The patients and work are the best part of my job. But the management is horrible and only favors certain employees. The work environment is unstable and there is no room for advancement. Davita does offer tuition reimbursement and that is a bonus.
good,"If your not good under pressure don't even think about working there. The Stress from this job is over whelming! I loved the patients, but its really hard to stay positive when your patient load is too much too handle."
good,"Davita is just like any other company. They cater to the patients. They work the technician as nurses but only want to pay the minimum required. They have you doing so many duties that take the load off the nurses but yet you still have to maintain and care for the patients all while they don’t fully train or require the nurses to know how to provide full patient care. The only thing that I consider satisfying, is that you grow a bond with the patients. The job advancement seems to only occur if your a nurse or going to school to be a nurse. They don’t offer anything to make you feel confident about being an employee. I’ve been with the company 13yrs and I’m one of the most knowledgeable and experienced techs at my clinic and I’ve yet to receive any kind of job advancement. I’ve always made outstanding feedback on my evaluation. Overall the company as a whole is about a 1 but if you want a job that will allow you to move around the world, dialysis is your go to career."
good,"If you happen to have a manager you are comfortable with, and who knows how to perform the duties they are asking you to do, you will probably do ok, the culture of the company can be borderline cultish at times as well"
good,"the hardest part of my job is never being within ratio, for patient to tech. The ratio is 1 to 4. I alone have 9 patients that I put on in the morning. We are often told that we are over staffed, but we are one of the largest clinics with 58 chairs and we are staffed like a clinic with 20 chairs. which makes for a high turner rate of employees."
good,"Davita is more concerned with making money than patient care and employee relations. You are pressured to clock out even before the day starts. The ""flexing off"" leaves 1 nurse and 1 tech with 7 patients regardless of acuity of patients. The entire day you are rushed to finish. Management is not trustworthy. They will tell you you merit raise was put in but it takes 6 months to get your increase promosed"
good,"Great weekend second job, lots of autonomy if you have dialysis experience and are comfortable with the dialysis procedure in general. Hopefully you are lucky to have a good team to work with."
good,You are way under paid. The work that we perform is life saving and is back breaking. We deserve more pay. The union should come in and help us techs.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"The DaVita IT environment follows the typical arch of a company that has an underfunded and overly leverage IT department. "
good,"Been with the company for 9 years. You get not so good health insurance, 401k but only matches when you apply 6%. Hours can be from 8-14 hours depending where you work. Managers are happy to hire anyone but refuses to weed out bad employees. Upper management needs to decide if they want to engage with lower staff or stay out of it. they tend to make promises they don't intend to keep or followup on. Managers quit often or moved around to cover multiple clinics at once. Expect short staffing issues, lower pay compared to similar jobs, and long hours."
good,The company is great but I was unfortunately under an FA who was lacking in leadership skills. I would recommend this company as my experience with corporate was fine. I feel they do value both patient and employee.
good,"Very competitive, many young college grads hired to replace experienced leaders. There is continual turnover and the departments and employees have no chance to build relationships or trust the national leadership teams."
good,"A lot of talk about work-life balance but that is all it is...talk."
good,"DaVita Rx is an okay place to work at if this is your first job. if you are looking to get industry standard experience then DaVita Rx is light years behind on technology, standards and process. Lots of manual processes, poor decision making and ineffective leadership doesnt make a good environment."
good,Micro managing cult is the best way I could describe this place. Time was managed down to the second.  Favoritism was obvious. Pay was decent.  It was an overall miserable job though.
good,"It's alright, nothing to get excited about. I mean it's a living but the management is eh. The thing is just awful when it comes to preferential treatment."
good,Working 16 hours shift when full time three days a week was stressful. Worked with an RN that wasn't charge material. When I went to my supervisor about it she did nothing.
good,"Admissions is not the place you want to be in DaVita. They do the bulk of the work and are not paid accordingly. They  can not retain good people because the pay is bad . Starting ppl off with 15/hr and the year raise is .11 cents. The culture of the company its self is great but the Admission department is terrible to their employees."
good,After Davita bought Healthcare Partners the work environment changed from pleasant to stressful. Their benefits are good. Plenty of overtime hours. Layoffs and uncertainty of job security
good,"Learned a lot from the company, great experience How to meet with raising my kidsLots of education great place to start out fresh from school would recommend for new hires"
good,this job started off simple and reasonable but as time went by rules became extreme and as a csr you were expected to pick up on slack the rest of the pharmacy brought
good,Great place to work if all you want to be is a floor nurse. Very little room for advancement in the state that i work because laws do not mandate managers to be registered nurses.
good,"Company hires for cultural fit and for copious amounts of energy. You are asked to assume additional duties with no compensation, bonus or recognition.  Employee evaluations are done once a year with minimal increases."
good,"each acute team has a different personality, the members on the team make up the rules as they go. very political and a lot of drama between floor nurses, dialysis, and physicians. never do you have a day off, your phone is always ringing with co-workers or someone from work wanting something."
good,"Good place to work if you have the right mindset.  Not a great place to advance your career and DVA never acknowledges mistakes in hiring bad managers.  Instead it'll promote and give more responsibility.  The pay is less than other places and they argue company culture makes up for that, which is true to a point.  After a few years it gets stale."
good,"I loved Davita the company as a whole, but my experience with the facility administrators were examples of extremely poor management. The clinics were run on motivation of money and personal not professional feelings and actions.It was more important if you were liked than if you did your job correctly."
good,"Many new tasks/responsibilities added to daily work, but the same production and quality expected. Not much opportunity to branch out or improve pay or status."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"The People of DaVita work hard however the Management is poor. "
good,No work/life balance. Long hours with terrible pay. No advancement and minimal raises. Would not recommend working here if you have a family and want to see them. The only reason I stayed as long as I did was my boss..she was phenomenal and I considered her a friend as well as superior. I was offered a job with a rival company for $6 more an hour than I was making at Davita. Pay your employees what they are worth! The techs work their butts off and make pennies to do so.
good,My facility is poorly ran management failure which makes it very stressful . There's no teamwork there. I've been with Davita 16 yrs  never had  a bad experience til now!
good,Like I said there's nothing really special that goes on just mostly data work and doing your job in a timely fashion or you get cut it's as simple as that.
good,"Working at Davita I have figured out how some companies can be so cheap and unfair.. Davita is a million dollar company and we make nothing for the work we all do, you would think a ""great"" company like Davita would pay there workers better. I only like working here due to some of the people I work with and the fact that I am able to help people that have to go through dialysis!"
good,"A Fast-pace and ever changing environment that challenges professional, social skills and problem solving abilities. On the job training is provided ."
good,"Honestly depends on the location your at weather you hate it or love it. Job requires early start time and very long days. It's your teammates and how well you guys work together that could either make your day good  or bad. Their  core values are well over praised because realistically when you go to your facility youll quickly realize it's all a bag of  bull**** . The facility manger will have favorites and it will be noticeable. For a Fortune 500 company their pay rates suck. For the amount of work you do they should really pay the employees more. Standing on your feet for almost 14 hours taken pts on and off the machine, Pushing meds and trying to remand sane is what your day will consist of. Davita is a stepping stone if you what to further your dialysis career."
good,Perfect for entry level high school graduates. Hard to make a living and still have family or personal time. No prior experience needed in most cases.
good,"If you get an amazing team of people work will be amazing. Lumberton Staff was the best group of people i have ever worked with. Willingboro clinic was a mess, loads of work even the benefits weren't worth working your life away daily."
good,"Checking for specimen integrity. 10 to 11 hours per day. Documentation in the LIS of rack received. Accessioning specimens. I learned some clinical research, work in Bio Repository. Management has changed every year since I have been there  and is lacking team building skills. Most of my co-workers make great team players to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is standing all day, and also the availability to advance is difficult there. I have asked repeatedly to be crossed trained in other departments."
good,great place to work people are freindly patients are well cared for and thei needs are put first and ate given all the attenttion they meed to have a great treament in a saffe environment
good,"You work your butt off for very little money. you work 14+ hour shifts, not for sure if you ever get a break and its almost impossible to move up unless your related or best friends with management."
good,"You have to work almost every weekend.  Demands from management is not realistic. Pay and co-workers was ok."
good,Job is ok . Room  for promotion is nonexistence. It's who you know not what you know...
good,"I handle two clinic's and all that is needed to run both, from order the material to treat the patients, to the supplies for the office. From the time I walk in I get pulled in a lot of directions, chart up dates, reports, insurance verification, handling admissions, transportation,  and helping with the patients getting their treatments.  This is a fast paced line of work you have to be organized or you will drowned the training is not much so most of what I learned was hands on. I enjoy most of the people I work with and the patients, this was a learning experience for me. I had never worked in the medical field, their is a lot to know, everyday I'm learning something new."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,The job was good.  The management team left a lot to be desired. Favoritism was the name of the game. A lot of mandantory overtime and extra work for an already hectic work load. Great co-workers who worked together as a well developed team.
good,Easy work but hard to lift patients. I've learned how stressful it can be for patients with kidney failure to have to come to dialysis every other day for the rest of their life.
good,"Administrative Assistant supports everyone, but nobody supports them. Pass down..."
good,"Assisted, monitored and provided evaluation, set up for patients receiving renal dialysis treatment 3 days a week for 4 hours.  Developed a good understanding of kidney disease, proper diet and a thorough knowledge of dialysis treatment.  Also developed a connection and relationship with the patients receiving these treatments on a regular basis.  Difficult for me was the loss of a patient from complications due to their kidney disease or other health concerns.  Thoroughly enjoyed impacting the patients with professionalism and giving the best care possible for their comfort in an uncomfortable situation."
good,"The operations group I worked with was very good and really lived the Core Values of DaVita and did a lot to help patients. They're a high performing and smart group of dedicated people who truly care about our patients and helping them to feel better. I loved working with them. The Talent Acquisition team was one that I didn't have a lot of respect for in their leadership. They are very out of touch and demanding without making people feel important, which was ultimately why I decided to leave. I was not feeling like I was appreciated and they drove numbers and metrics to the point where you didn't enjoy what you were doing anymore. The work/life balance was out of balance as well and I worked far too many weekends/6-7 days a week. I didn't get paid enough for that."
good,Like the concept of the job and work company provides as a dialysis company for the patients
good,Initiation and termination of the dialysis procedure. Maintain overall patient well-being while under care.
good,Most enjoyable part of my job are caring for and interacting patents and staff.
good,"New Patient Admission and Patient Registration. Administrative Assistant responsibilities. Meets with new/existing patients’ patient to discuss Medical Insurance assessment.  Educate patient of financial rights and responsibilities.  Identify and communicate effectively opportunities to better the insurance status of the patient, alleviating financial risk and burden for patient and facility.  Initiate appropriate and necessary paperwork ensuring least amount of patient and facility liability.  Initiate and ensure Provide high-level of customer service to patients to ensure patient needs are met.  Act as a liaison between patients, facility teammates, billing office and the corporate office to resolve patient insurance issues and/or concerns; proactively establish relationships with patients"
good, 
good,"Great experience with a professional team with patient care and quality of life as the number one goal. Very fast paced and long work days, 14-16 hour days"
good,"I have learned new projects and ways to maximize my multitasking skills. The hardest part of the job is finding a balance meeting company goals based on percentges and scores while individual goals patient to patient from the clinic level is not the key focus. The most enjoyable part of the job is working face to face with the patients and providing not only a service, but helping the overall greater good of the patient, family, company and community."
good,"Boring a little unprofessional,didn't. Really didn't learn anything from this job,the coworkers were bland and was to into the work,the hardest part of the job was dealing with the environment"
good,This company requires its techs to work 12-16 hour days 5-6 days a week leaving little time for family; especially when children are involved. They have an extremely small clinical staff and expect 2-3 staff members to care for the needs of 16 patients.
good,Working for Davita is amazing if there are available reliable Teammates to work. The schedule and hours are amazing for nurses . We work three days out of the week and have the ability to pick up extra hours at other clinics.
good,It's a steady job as long as you don't mess up. Very little room for growth in the department I was in. The people are nice but there is little emphasis on improvement.
good,Pay doesn’t meet the labor. Often work short handed to meet company goal off staffing. The best rewards are caring for patients and great co workers. Has potential to be a great place of employment
good,DaVita was a decent company to work for I was there for approximately five years but changes in the company and conditions I made the decision To look for other employment with a different company at this time
good,"Star Program helps train new employees, and assist with the transition into the chronic hemodialysis unit. Other support staff available to help with concerns."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,I never get a raise in 5 years iWork there the benefit is not great I try to transfer to another position I was denied skip the position I will never work for davita again
good,"Very fast pace, constantly under staffed called in for extra hours all the time. Hard on the body repetitive movements. Poor management, stressfull do to out of your control time management,"
good,Dialysis is not easy long hours starting at 4 am short staffed you always feel rushed over worked and  underpaid technicians. Low raises if you have small children I wouldn’t recommend
good,"The hours are rough, your ALWAYS understaffed and they cant even keep management. Dangerous tech to patient ratios. Could be great, properly staffed. And with solid management."
good,"typical day for my particular clinic was 4:30am - 8:00pm three days a week although they constantly wanted me to work four days a week. worked there for over 3 years. Good benefits and good pay ( after you have worked there for at least 6 months. They grossly underpay in the beginning). Job was overall very stressful and non-stop the majority of the shift. Excellent training!! There are some great nurses that i worked with, but when there is someone dragging the team down, unhelpful,  or even unsafe with patients they NEVER were let go causing the whole team more stress. between the long hours and rude, verbally abusive patients i am burnt out!"
good,"Worked for the company for about 10 years. The first few years were great until management was replaced. Once management replaced, there was no empathy. Expected me to put me entire life on hold so I could work."
good,Placed on a team of disgruntled employees that turned out to be a bit of a damper on my success and enjoyment/fulfillment. Casual dress code and onsite gym was a big plus
good,The work at DaVita is demanding and fast pace however it is also very rewarding. At the end of the day I stay because of my patients. This is their lifeline and it’s a blessing to actually give life as your career!
good,"On call all the time"
good,DaVita does a great job training you for the job (depending on ur dept). They have a core value of fun and they do have fun at work. As far as being promoted it’s not what you know it’s who you suck up to
good,"I worked for Davita RX. This subsidiary was closed. While I was there the company was not bad, but there were definite issues with fairness in compensation."
good,I loved the job! really good place to work hours can be long but very rewarding job. the pay left a lot to be desired given the work being done. If the pay was better they wouldn't have to worry about the high turn over rate.
good,"My typical day at work is overloaded with tasks."
good,"I have a great FA so my only two big complaints which would be the reason I leave is the lack of good benefits and competitive salary. For the amount of work you do they refuse to pay appropriately. You are only able to get either a 1%, 2% or 3% pay raise of what you are currently make which is less than a dollar and this is just every year. Because of this the turnover rate is high and have a hard time hiring. If you work at one of the clinics be prepared to always be short staffed."
good,hardest part of the job is the compensation. Fun environment to work in. This place can easily become a routine due to the slow advancement. Perks of working here is team building events
good,Great values. Work is humbling and a great skill to have. Committee to a couple years for the life experience. Do not work excessive hours you don't have to.
good,The company has great modules for training and guidelines for on the floor training. After you are trained you’re expected to work 12-15 hour days and get called in often on your days off.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Used to be a great place to work, still is I guess, management has been here and there, not consistent. In my experience when any promotion is posted, it seems they already have the person picked, doesn’t matter if they are already with the company or outside application. Seniority doesn’t matter. Moral is low where I work. On the upside, my patients like me and I love taking care of them."
good,"There are a number of issues that DaVita tries to address but just cannot seem to get there. The lack of a tangible strategic roadmap is the biggest issue in my opinion. The roadmap is based on the direction of the non-technical leadership and not on qualified subject matter expertise. "
good,"Good people at the clinic level, getting new equipment takes an act of Congress. Clinics should be kept in a state of,the condition, where it makes employees, patients and biomeds comfortable to work."
good,Challenging environment.  There is high turnover but worthwhile work. The teammates work long hours but really care about their patients.  Leadership is working to improve things.
good,"Davita is FUN however the workload, especially for supervisors, is unrealistically high. Managers continued to pile tasks, meeting etc onto the supervisor group making it impossible to produce high quality work."
good,"When a patient was over their credit limit and the company policy would not allow shipment of medication until a payment plan was in place. DaVita had a good model, however with most insurance plans restricting patients to use certain mail order pharmacies."
good,"Misguided and a lack of understanding of technology impacts to business and Operational workflows.  Always chasing the ""silver bullet"" without seeing the whole picture."
good,"As a dialysis patient care tech I disinfect dialysis equipment and prepares the fluid used for each patient during dialysis. I inserts dialysis needles into a patient's arm veins, start the equipment and monitors the patient. I also inject patients with anticoagulants and change the speed or rate of dialysis as necessary during the procedure once receiving confirmation form the CN. Once the session is over, a dialysis technician disconnects the patient from the equipment and applies dressings to the puncture area. Dialysis patient care techs are also responsible for preparing accurate reports regarding each patient. "
good,Upper managment is grea at least philosophically at DaVita it's your local management that is the issue.  Poor wages and raises but it is a fun place to work.  Not a place for a career if you are trying to raise a family.
good,"It's an okay company."
good,DaVita is a great place to work.  The company really celebrates the culture and attempts to provide the best place to work ever.  DaVita focuses on quality of care.
good,I have gained knowledge and experiences from the teammate and the job itself. I think it's a great place to work and grow a future career. there are great opportunities for the teammates who are willing to grow.
good,This job is fun to work for. They really value the fun aspect in your daily job. They have job growth and you can relocate to different areas for job growth as well.
good,"Lots of work to complete, set to work in groups. Must be outgoing and willing to assist others that may not be pulling their weight. Difficult communication setup with outside resources that one need to  work with. Protocols set are not always followed and turnaround expectations are too difficult to meet."
good,"Dialysis is a complex disease- I have learned a lot and continue to learn, but the EMR currently in use at Davita forces you to have to double and triple chart the same thing and sets you up for errors.  They seem to make a difficult and demanding job more complex and difficult and everything is ultimately the RN's responsibility.  I love my patients and the staff I work with but if you can't trust everyone on your team to do their job well than it's not worth your license."
good,It is a great company to work for. There is always a opportunity for overtime and you can pick up other shifts at different clinics. They offer bonuses for extra shifts as well. Management at my clinic sucks but the company overall is ok
good,Davita is a great company overall and have great core values. I think that on an individual level people that are within davita at individual levels do not hold up to the core values and many may never be reported and  this is why many clinics fail and people may be unhappy.
good,In my time working for this company the higher management (Regional Operations Director and above) were not approachable and did not understand the needs at the facility level. They did not provide good support to the team and often did not uphold the core values DaVita sets as a standard.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Very stressful due to the hours worked and not enough staff to work the hours assigned. Under paid if you are not licensed which make for lousy coworkers because they are only working for the easy income rather than actually having pride in the work being done.
good,"My experience here is remarkable,i work on the  the biggest clinic i should say if not in california the whole nation with 50 chairs including isolation. Nice working environment,benefits and cultrure.i enjoy working with my co- workers."
good,There are worse jobs. I really do not want to say anymore than that but this stupid survey is making me. This review section should be optional instead of mandatory.
good,Davita cares about its patients. It has a nice culture where team work is encouraged. Management varies in different regions as well as the operations of the facilities.
good,everything about Davita was excellent. its overall a phenomenal company to work for. unfortunately the F.A was horrible and created a fearful and hostile work environment. he did not provide proper training which led to it feeling like a sink or swim deal in the beginning. luckily the team was helpful. the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the workload of an understaffed environment the most enjoyable part of the job was the team and all of the wonderful patients that were there.
good,"Difficult company to work for.  Started when they were Total Renal Care, went through bankruptcy threat with company; watched it grow into a Fortune-500 company.  Along that journey it was unfortunate that the company exec's lost their sense of family and started treating people as expendables.  While everyone in every position can be replaced, it is disheartening to hear that on a daily basis from management."
good,Professional atmosphere was evident most of the time; but the compensation is very low compare to other companies. There were also many favoritism shown from the managers to the employees.
good,"Find the right facility, despite long working hours, and you can enjoy working for this company because you play an important role in providing the needed services for kidney failure patients.  If you become a stench to management, don't wait, transfer or resign before you are terminated as you may not be able to work for the company again. I regret, this is what happened to me."
good,davita was a fast pace working environment. I moved because of the early work hours as i have little kids at home and my commute was an hours which made things even more difficult for me.
good,"I worked there for two months.  Typical work day was fast paced as a nurse you are responsible for a lot of documentation and hard physical labor.  Cleaning stations, chairs, floors, machines all day.  12 hours or more hours with only a 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks.  Your shift depends on the unity of your team mates.  If they are selfish and don't pitch in to help you are basically on your own with a tech.  The nurse ratio at the facility I was in was 1 nurse to 12 patients.  For DaVita that is considered SAFE.  For myself it was not especially since patients crash all the time on the dialyzer so you have to be quick on your feet and a quick critical thinker.  "
good,"Overall it is an okay job; it pays the bills.  I think a lot depends on which clinic you work in but most times you are understaffed, and poor management.  You can not count on your manager to help you when you need it the most.  Staffing has a high turn over rate due to the pay.  Most other companies pay a lot better in comparison to DaVita."
good,I enjoyed this job just not the company I worked for.  I worked both acutes and chronic and enjoyed taking care of my patients.  Davita is for profit company and cares less for you or the pts than they do for their profit size
good,too much favoritism with the clinic i worked at i had several jobs to do while  others just come there to collect a paycheck i would not recommend this clinic i worked at .lunch and learn they would dock our pay the clinic has alot of issues!!!!! and they took away our profirt sharing away
good,"It was long hours, but I enjoyed the patients. The continuity in patient care was awesome. It was undergoing some management changes which made it hard to know who to talk to when things didn't seem up to par. The attitudes of some of the older nurses was absurd. My goal was to work hard, see my patients happy and teamwork."
good,Culture has changed.  Turnover is very high.  Used to be a fun company to work for.  Now people find it hard to work for this company.  Very low staff
good,"pharmacists were basically treated like factory workers. The position was boring and professionally unsatisfying. pharmacists were required to clock in and out for lunch and breaks at specific times and if you were late written warnings were issued and lose of job was a possibility.Raises, which were miniscule, would be negatively effected by not adhering perfectly to their factory-like standards."
good,"It was a good work environment, but I feel that the pay wasn't close to industry standards. "
good,Not a healthy work environment if you have a family long hours 6 days a week and holidays. Shifts start at 3:30 am was not a fun place or enjoyable place to work. I loved my patients but not the environment.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"DaVita is an attractive corporation with a plethora of opportunities for growth and advancement within the overall corporation.  Gary, IN facility however was too often understaffed and chaotic."
good,"Overall the company is good to work for.  The culture and employees have a passion for the work they are hired to accomplish."
good,"Big company so advancement or movement is good.  Salary on the low side.  If you get a good manager, flexibility on time is good.  Free lunches are abundant."
good,"Very fast paced and stressful. Pay is decent, good training and job security. I would recommend this job to someone as long as they are aware that the days are long and start early."
good,Fast paced treatment floor.  Solid team of nurses to work with. Safety and compliance are high on the pro list.  Management inexperience high on the con list.
good,"people and updated building is the best thing about this job"
good,"Had a potential to be a great place to work, and still does.  Current problems include too many patients and not enough staff, leading to very hard, very long work days (sometimes 16 or 17 hours).  If they can keep from scaring off new employees (I'm an example of this) long enough to get adequate staffing with subsequent shorter work days, it should be a pretty cool place to work."
good,Joyful experience helping others and providing dialysis to patients. co-workers are nice and overall experience sub par based on disorganized workload and mismanagement.
good,"There is absolutely no work/life balance at this company; I never know when I'm getting off.  Management is horrible, upper management calls the shot not realizing the impact it has on the daily operations of the clinic.  The clinic is always understaffed, at times out of state regulations."
good,"I am remote employee for the pharmacy working in the field in several of the dialysis clinics across the US"
good,Money is the primary focus of this company. They do not take precautions to ensure safety for patients if they will be spending too much money on associates staffing the unit. Short staffing is a huge problem and all associates experience burnout after being worked to the bone.
good,"Davita is an excellent company to work for, as long as you're not a PCT (dialysis technician). The job is very rewarding, but with the amount of blood/infections/contagious illnesses/hepatitis classes/chemicals that you are exposed to, the compensation is very low and disappointing."
good,Wonderful team mates and excellent opportunity to learn but pay not competitive. Not enough opportunities for technicians to move up other than becoming nurses
good,"DaVita is a great place to work if you do not have professional work experience and are seeking to build professional history. Once you're able to exercise your analytical skills, you'll move on to something more professional."
good,"Patients are the reason I am here. I try to put myself in their place thinking how I would feel. I am physically able to do my job. Working hard will not hurt me. If I can help a Coworker, I will. I hope they would do the same for me. Teamwork goes a long way. In the dialysis business, it can happen at any given monement, needing and extra pair of hands, eyes, or as they say, two heads are better than one."
good,"Very early mornings that lead to very late days.  typical day would start at 4am and and end at 6pm with only a 1/2 hour break for lunch. Although I learned SO much about kidney disease and the interworkings of the kidney itself, I had a very hard time managing the 4-5 patients each Tech is allotted bc these people are terminally ill and need constant care. I was not fond of management bc we were sorely understaffed which required more of the 3 of us that worked there and he had a much to confident outlook on how much we could ""take on"" and didn't regard the burn out factor. I loved the medical aspect of it, the phlebotomy portion of it was my favorite, I became known as the ""best poker"" because I was fast and accurate. The hardest part was watching these people you've grown to care for, code and pass away in the chair occasionally."
good,"DaVita is a good company and great for dialysis patients. Community first, Company second. I worked there for 17 years."
good,12 hour shift and no family life patients were happy to have us available and would show there appreciation learned a lot about dialysis
good,I have gained medical experience and patient care. This job is more for someone who doesn't have a family. Work schedule is not set.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Enjoyed the patients and the fast pace work flow. Great benefits and wonderful PTO. Fun floor atmosphere. Techs are well educated on how to help pt
good,"very short staffed in all aspects of the business, poor annual raises, subpar management, not many chances for advancement"
good,"When starting out, the culture and village showed a lot of promise. The structure has a lot of work in progress. Davita is a great stepping stone to a bigger position. Not enough room for growth."
good,Observed and hands on experience in a dialysis setting.  Worked diverse hours.  Great teamwork and ability to handle a 4 patient pod by myself.
good,Decent enough place to work but management can be dumbstruck and there's many instances of favoritism  and personal bias.
good,"Great place to work and be involved with committees (Community Service Programs, Fun Committees, volunteer at centers)"
good,"the demand of the job. working 6 days of the week from 4:30 am to 4:30-5:00pm and holidays will get at anyone. I don't work those hours anymore but am constantly asked to do, do , do will no pay raise."
good,The work day was the same every day and its about a ten hour day. I learned about the importance of communicating with a team and being able to delegate task and be a leader. Management worked towards bringing the team together. The hardest part of the job was communicating with management when there were issues. The most enjoyable part was getting to know my patients because I saw them at least three days a week.
good,This job is good for people that like fast paced environments.  The only down side is the long hours but that depends on the clinic you work for.
good,It is a job better suited for someone who is young and has endless energy.  Hours are long 10 - 15 hour days and schedule is hard with 4 up to 6 workdays.
good,"Some clinics could use more organization, first by starting off hiring well qualified managers. Managers is the key to the clinic having team players and good patient care, some clinics lack in this."
good,"A typical day would consist of machine setup for patient treatments, passing medications  and then interacting with patients about their diet, blood work and general health if they are having any problems.  Communicating with doctors about patient health issues.  Documentation of patient progress.  I did not consider this job hard, my co-workers were very dedicated to their job,  The most enjoyable part was the interaction with patients."
good,"Say they promote from within, but you have to be part of the club to get a promotion. Fun is a core value, but not if you want to be promoted."
good,If you don't like a RA RA! Environment then DaVita may not be the place for you.  There is a definite and unique culture to this company!
good,"company has great policies in place but they are not inforced properly, equipment is getting old and breaks down alot "
good,Busy and hectic from when you walk in the door to when you leave. Very stressful and high demanding. Co-workers are also stressed but enjoyable because your in the trench's together. Most enjoyable part of the job is most of the patients.
good,"I have learned numerous skills in the dialysis field that I would like to continue. A typical work day consist of coming in doing the best job I can do. Management is not the best because they don't try to help the teammate get raises when they obtain certification in CCHT. If you have experience in the medical field the starting pay is not that good. My co workers are the great. We help each other in many ways, emotionally and physically. The hardest part of my job is  trying to get my patients to eat healthy. The most enjoyable part of my job is when you have a patient to get a transplant."
good,alot of hours for low staff. changes staff frequently due to the hours and stress and time away from family
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,DaVita is a great starting point in the medical profession.
good,Love the staff and the patients. Patients become like family because you see them almost every other day.
good,"Davita has a great mission and philosophy, however, most of the employees at Davita just give this a passing glance.  It would be a wonderful place to work if everyone participated in the mission and culture."
good,DaVita overall has plenty of room for growth and advancement. Unfortunately once at management level the organization lacks to meet the expectations.
good,Typical day at work involved me working my que down below the mandatory requirement of 25 patients and then helping my teammates to work their que down also. There was no accountability for my coworkers so i would do 3 peoples work a lot of the time. The hardest part of the job was hearing the word team being thrown around but it not being enforced.
good,"Very busy clinic, little guidance from upper management.  I was left to my own devices often."
good,"scheduling - poor"
good,Sterilizing the artificial Kidneys of patients throughout the day. I learned about how Kidney failure affects many people. I also learned what can be done to avoid Kidney failure. The hardest part of the job was getting to know patients and being informed of them passing away
good,The company overall feeds employees a lot of non-sense to make them feel better about working there. But the pay is not as good as other companies. They do not match 401K. 
good,Typical day starts at 4:30 AM. Open the doors for the 48 lovely patients and oversee the care and safety of all patients. The best part of my job is the patient's. the hardest part of my job is working short-handed due to frequent call-ins. 
good,"Fun place to work, but to lenient on people not doing their job. Kind Management, often to kind and afraid to take charge and tell people what they need to do."
good,I love working at a company where its main purpose is to improve the quality of a persons life and that's is what I did everyday at DaVita.
good,"The environment is fun but can be very stressful. I learned how to set up the machines to prepare the patient for dialiysis. I learned different and many rules and regulations in my trainings. Management I will not disclose at this time. The coworkers were all pleasant and did what they could to help patients and some staff. The hardest part of the job was learning each patient and the care they each needed which I aim to please, but you learn to love each one and they do not always live to the next visit. This takes a peice of one whom is compassionate about patient care. Reality of it is it is a very different job from Medical Assisting and you have to have alot of heart and patience to deal in dialyss all together. The enjoyeable part was the patient interaction, the training trips, the co-workers. Just know that dealing with sick people when they come in it the little things I would try to do to make them smile before they left. That was the best part of my day."
good,"While all clinics are different, the commonality is that older employees are resistant to change. Speaking up is not O.K., and managers tolerate horizontal bulling."
good,"My day starts off with reviewing my e-mails to see if there is anything I need to take care of. I usually repond to anyone who is trying to contact me. Then after that I usually look for current lab results, then review them. If I have low or high results I call the doctor immediatley to go over them with the doctor. If there is any medication changes I usually order the medication then inform my patient of the changes. I update the medication into the patient's record, then call the pharmacy to order the medication. I order supplies from Baxter or NXStage. I train patients sometime in the mornings or sometime in the afternoons depending on the patient schedual. The hardest part of my job is staying focused. Not missing anything that needs to be done because there are so many distraction from the phone calls coming in. The delivery people knocking on the door, and because my office is closest to the back door I am the one always end up opening it. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with all the expectations that management place on me. The most enjoyable part of my job is taking care of the patient's and also my proffessional relationship with the patients. My co-workers help me to get my job done when I need them to help me accomplish certain task, but there is room for improvement when it comes to working together as a team."
good,high expectations unrealistic heavy turnover in upper management
good,"Corporation+healthcare = poor management and wrong priorities. "
good,"I floated and worked at plenty of clinics in California and in Florida. You'll find some that you like and some that you wouldn't want to come back to. But once you've found the clinic you like, stick by it."
good,"People are respectful and collaborative. Different shift to work and hours. The managers are very support, and they value your work. Better insurance than other places."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Loved working at Davita because I am able to establish a personal relationship with my patents. Davita is a fast paced environment and I loved it because it allowed time to pass by.  Love working with my current team mates because we all work together as team and we make our job fun.
good,"This can be a rewarding job where you get to know your patients and help others. However, with upper management too focused on metrics and the bottom line, they do not have the employees and patients' best interest at heart. Years of service do not mean anything, you are replaceable if not willing to ""comply"" and kiss up to upper management. This company over works their employees and expects too much productivity and performance in little amount of time. It is never good enough, even when goals are met. However, if in an area with great management and at a clinic with a great FA and team, this can be a great job!  The pay is decent and hours can be flexible depending on the week."
good,"Everything started off fine, management has now varied on core values and is horrible to deal with. As much as you want to have patient centered care, it is near impossible at the local level."
good,"A high pace work dynamic with multiple areas of growth. Must be able to work with Strict guidelines, and quick turn around times. 90% offsite work, must be able to work independently."
good,I enjoy working with this company.  The only problem is that my FA does not keep her words.  It made me frustrated.  The company itself is good as long as you meet the right co-workers.
good,"DaVita can be very energy depleting because you work with people who are usually chronically ill and they have many emotional ups and downs. The people who work there can also be downers, especially because it’s tough working so many hours on your feet and the patients can drain a lot of energy from you. It’s also hard when they die and it either hurts or just becomes part of the job."
good,"DaVita expects a lot from management and has a great company culture at the office level. The pay is on the low end of competitive, especially for raises. They switched bonuses for a 401K match program that is an insulting joke. At the manager level down, the people are fantastic and above that it is very hit or miss"
good,Have only positive things to say as far as training and the culture of Davita itself and I hate that one extremely poor manager on his way out the door who did not model that culture with his actions ruined the entire image I had of davita I loved the policy and procedure aspect but somehow this particular Southside manager was exempt from following it... They have amazing trainers and great ideas unfortunately I've seen it's hit or miss with managers it's more like one for all and all for everyone except the new people.
good,"The positions require a 12-hour workday so having hours cut is not an issue in the company. By California law, once an individual who gets paid by the hour works beyond 8 hours, their hourly rate increases to time and a half."
good,"I wish they were honest about PCT bridging to AFA/FA and other opportunities. What they tell you is anyone can do it!! You take all the classes (DSS), preceptor-U etc.."
good,"I love this job, but the people I work with are not team players very rude and disrespectful. It’s hard to get though a workday when you get treated that way. There is one RN out there that’s is amazing and honestly is the only reason I’m still working there."
good,"To Performs and records vital signs and all other parameters of ESRD patients, obtains blood samples and culture specimens and prepares for shipment, monitors and documents status of vascular accesses, Initiates dialysis, filing, lab requisitions, scheduling appointments, answering phones, ordering supplies, copying, faxing, data entry, maintaining patient charts, Set up and monitor dialysis machines and reverses osmosis water system for correct functioning."
good,"depending on the days your work , you wont meet your full time hours. on a Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday schedule which are usually the short days at most clinics, you only have 2 shift so  you barely make 10 hrs a day times 3 that only 30 hrs a week, when full time is 36+. this is what upsets me about this job.."
good,"Very fast paced company, can be very frustrating and tiring at times. I feel the patients need more time with their caregivers and they are basically put on the treatment and taken off and ready for the next people to be put on"
good,"need more structure to be able to stick to mission statement.  You need strong time management skills.  It can be difficult adjusting to working shift work because you either go in really, get out late, or both."
good,"The company is a very good place to work. The people there are very nice and there seems to be a teamwork environment.  Few directors seem incompetent, like they never led mid-level Managers while other directors are amazing leaders and foster a great environment."
good,Great company with great core values. Message sometimes skewed by large company and middle management. Great resources for development and patient education.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Upper management is non-clinical and makes the job hard. Some davita areas do not focus on mission and values, they do not live by the credo. The company has taken a tremendous change with hiring veterans for positions and more non clinical experience management. Hire for 40 hours but staff have to travel to others clinics to get hours and this is not explained at point of hire"
good,"Long hours of duty from 5:15 to 7:00pm is tiresome, at the end of the day we are not as effective anymore.  There is a huge responsibility to work as a charge nurse because you work at the desk while having 9 patients in 1 shift.  Sometimes, we are understaff that we have to assume all the duties of a nurse and technicians as well.  The downside is the compensation is not really high considering the job that we are doing.  The schedule is flexible though but there is no sick leave, only PTO.  FA is non-medical person but willing to spend for the supplies needed."
good,"Work never stays at work. You are constantly on call, and dealing with small problems. If you are looking for a work/life balance, this is not it. Hardest part of the job is finding a work life balance."
good,"They have an amazing company culture.  The people are fantastic.  The CEO's are amazing human beings.  The company's mission and values are authentic and drive the culture. "
good,"A typical day at work is long working hours, and varied shifts- hours are never set and managers expect you to pick up as many shifts as possible. The job is very physically demanding and are constantly on your feet. The patients are the best part of the job and keep you going!"
good,"This is a secure job with plenty of opportunities for advancement, however, no work-life balance. Minimal training for advancement positions. As with other corporations there is favoritism, cliques and bullying."
good,"When I  started I was warned by employees on their way out the door, that the company was shifting from patient focused to money hungry. This has become very apparent in my 2 years here. They keep bringing in FA's that have no clinical background nor any real experience in clinics which is causing heavy turn around of managers and teammates. The managers don't value nor respect the nurses or techs and I have witnessed management throw nurses under the bus for mistakes made by management. We just had a manager that told a teammate he was ""replaceable"" when he asked for a raise for having to close and open the clinic everyday for more than 2 months straight. Every clinic is short staffed so you will be asked to do more than 1 job but you will only get compensated for 1. Management will tell you what you want to hear to get you out of their office and then nothing will change."
good,"As soon as I was hired on, I was sent on an all expense paid trip out of state to learn about the Davita mission.  It was a great weekend and to get paid on top of that was a real perk"
good,"This is a good company as a whole, just pray that you actually get into a good facility where your FA has not hired her friends who take advantage of their position. Nurses who don't really care about the patients and would rather sabotage other coworkers they don't like at the patients expense."
good,Low pay a hour hard to get raises too much responsibility with no pay.  You never see your boss shows up for a hour then gone for the day. A lot of favoritism in the workplace.
good,"Not secure position with the pharmacy, company knew they were ending before they hired reps on, loved working with patients and teammates and wished I could continue"
good,13- 14 hours days non stop caring for patients starting at 5 a.m.. very busy days there were different aspects to the job not all the same scenario. As this is a place were patients are very ill the most enjoyable part was when they felt they had a good day.
good,"This is a company that will give you good initial training but they will try and start you at the lowest possible rate. If you are an RN or above, you have the chance to advance but not much for technicians."
good,I enjoy the work I do and the patients are awesome.  Staff leaves A little to be desired.  Hard part is I only work on clinic days (3) and the job takes more than that to complete - never get caught up I guess that s job security.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Fast paced for a few hours, followed by a slower pace. Patients are very involved in their treatment and care plan. Training is great. Staff work together as a team."
good,"this is a very well known, well respected organization. After approximately one year, I realized that i did not wish to work in this field. I was well compensated, and had a very nice office. Health insurance was also quite good."
good,"poor management, overworked, does not listen to staff about concerns or poor job duties done by other employees. management does not at all nor does the gm"
good,"I really enjoyed my patients and miss some of the people i worked with. I thought the management could have showed a little more care about some of the staff, I felt like he really didn't care if his staff stayed or left as long as there was staff to work."
good,typical day at work is good but hardest part of the job lacks of teammates and nurse had to work PCT's job in putting on patient and doing her nurse job at the same time.
good,"Pay rates & yearly raises could be better, company is financially driven, for profit company. The worse employee healthcare benefits and compensation."
good,Fast paced stressful  lack of support from teammates.   Pro paid time off  pay doesn't reflect the responsibility.  Knowing that you are helping people is satisfying
good,It’s a great place to start with little experience .Nurses are willing to train . Working independently after training is the goal. Training is very fast and repetitive you will learn quickly.
good,The most thing I like about the job is caring for the patients I liked  to see them happy and being involved treatment. I also like working independently with the years of knowledge I have it goes a long way.
good,"Poor salary compensation!!"
good,"DaVita has one of the best corporate cultures I have seen - fun work environment, company events and parties and a collaborative work environment - smart and dedicated teams"
good,"Don't get me wrong, the people that I worked with were a fun group.  Answering phone calls all day for people that don't know a desktop tower from a modem or refer to an Ethernet cable as a Wifi cable was a bit painful after a while, some might even say it was soul sucking.  Management was great and they seemed to really care and wanted to make everyone happy, but there were factors that were out of their control.  I would like to commend them on their efforts and how they would make time to have a 1 on 1 with their employees at least once a month to listen to grievances and suggestions on how to make the job a little more bearable."
good,"I have learned a lot learned a lot from working at DaVita. Learning how to work with Excel and Microsoft work are two of my major accomplishments at DaVita. Along with being presented with my awards for Service Excellence and being the Shining Star for my department.   My typical day is normally uploading accounts, answering emails, getting mail merge letters, printing medical records and keying in adjustments. "
good,Typical hours were very early morning and would have to stay late.  530 am start time and sometimes would not leave till after 730pm or later for some clinics.
good,Davita has a family culture and offer some perks. But the hours are long and the work is plentiful. Occasional lunches are provided. You work with a small team. Tons of education is available.
good,Quick pace with not enough time allowed to properly do your job. 20 minutes at the start of the day to set up machines and enter patients into the computers is not really enough time.
good,Davita is a fun environment but your day starts at 4 am and may be scheduled till 4 pm but you may not get out of there until 6pm or later. The management will help you but I think there is a lot of favoritism.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"This place is okay to work . The culture is embracing and the people are very nice except for upper management. The job itself is not that difficult, it's just the"
good,Management was a huge problem with this company in the Medical Review Dept.  There was a lot of office drama which I did not care for or want to be a part of.  Management hired people who were their cronies but had no experience. There was no room for advancement and it was not a healthy atmosphere to work in.  Turnover rate was high.
good,"Great co-workers, people are friendly and will work as a team to help in any situation long hours make you like family. very fast paced can be stressful at times."
good,davit is a fast paced job and 12 hours a day 4 days a week. the patients are amazing and require the best of care. it is a job that requires excellent critical thinking skills
good,The hours are long and there are minimal days off. This is a small community of professionals that work very hard to ensure thier patients receive the best possible care.
good,Davita is a good company to work for. They treat you well and compensate competitively.There is a cap on salary for technicians. There is a good system though throughout the clinics.
good,"The unique culture takes some getting used to, but underneath the layer of frosting it's still Corporate America. This is a good place to work if you've just graduated from college."
good,"If you can deal with many different attitudes and it doesn't bother you,  then this is the place for you. It's very fast pace,  and it requires very long hours."
good,"Davita is a great company as a whole to work for awesome benefits, great pay, I ended up in the wrong clinic which is why I am not at Davita. The most enjoyable part of the job is really the patients."
good,DaVita was an incredible place to learn the industry and grow.  The company is the best at training staff at every level and there are various opportunities for growth.
good,Lots of fun Teammate here. Overall good job. Fun atmosphere very good core values. Little low on the pay scale. Company is an awesome place to work...
good,Busy business office with super high volume. Many positions available in the company but admissions role is where I currently work in and I like it but can be stressful
good,LONG hours with call.. Work level management is lacks. Requires acute care RN experience. Requires travel between locations. Need to be able to work alone and be able to trouble shoot both renal and peritoneal dialysis machinery.
good,Comparatively the pay could be better. There are favorites in each clinic and you can easily gain a bad/good reputation within a short period of time. The hardest part of this job to me is definitely the backstabbing and gossip that goes on. My recommendation is to stay clear of the cliques.
good,"Tasks included daily reporting data analysis, average 3 meetings daily. We planned many events for teammates and was always opportunity's to participate in events and fundraisers."
good,You work very hard and get a 1.5% raise once a year. They speak about the patient comes first but they are all about the numbers. Meeting quotas and goals.
good,"The position itself was a great rewarding career where if you are in the field help this is the position. The hours were horrible, the trainers once I got to my clinic were horrible and petty"
good,They have wonderful doctors on their research staff.  A pleasure to work for.  This is always a fun environment.  Staff members are helpful to newcomers.
good,It is a very fulfilling job but it is very demanding and takes up a lot of your personal time. Not a job that you can call off on.patient safety is a must
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"This company is all about fun. However, when it comes to compensating their teammates they fall short. You are required to do a lot of work and not fairly compensated."
good,"DaVita strives to create a workplace that is safe and coordinated for both it's patients and staff. However, they do not always meet this goal. The staffing ratios and patient loads can be overwhelming, and the organization and time management is not always properly coordinated. The staff is given too little time to transition between patients, and this causes the patients to become frustrated with their quality of care. Often the staff is overworked and running behind on treatment times. The problem is actively addressed by the administration, and they are working on opening new facilities and hiring more staff to meet the growing patient volumes. The floor staff really strives to stay on top of things and to help out when another co-worker is falling behind."
good,Wonderful people.  No work/life balance.  Administrative staff are not treated with a lot of respect.  There is a lot of opportunity for others to grow within the organization.  DaVita is growing rapidly!
good,"Compensation and benefits are not much to be desired. The work you do as a Patient Care Technician can be difficult mentally and physically, but can be rewarding in it's own way."
good,Techs have multiple duties and tasks that are not compensated for. The training is fast paced and expectations are high.
good,"Arriving to work at 5:15am, setting up my machines & getting ready for my first shift of PTs. Before the shift ends, I'm monitoring BP & PT stability & effectiveness of tx. The first shift usually starts to turnover at 9am. That's when I start disconnecting & connecting my 1st & 2nd shift PTs. Turnover is usually the mos critical time for most PTs. If any PT is going to get sick & start not to feel well, it most of the time happens then. Once turn over is compete, I make sure my four PTs are stable enough & I take a 30 minute break. I also like for it to be known that I will not be on the floor to the charge nurse, so my PTs are being monitored while I'm away. Around 12 o'clock the last turn over happens, between 2nd & 3rd shift. The last shift of the day.I enjoy being at work & interacting with each PT on a professional manner. At times the team gets a little uneasy & hard to work with, but the work gets done. I make sure all chairs& machines are disinfected, & bio hazard is thrown away between shifts. I feel as I've accomplished a lot by the end of my day."
good,As an employee you work very long days. You get to work independently. pay is good due to all the overtime. Staff is pretty nice. You need to be very patient and flexible with your schedule.
good,Good experience but job satisfaction is only as good as its management. Hemodialysis is an excellent skill for nurses. Good compensation.
good,"This was a Temporary Assignment, I enjoyed the assignment and realized they have some serious issues with healthcare coverage for some of their patients. I regret the assignment was so short due to the seriousness of the need. The healthcare providers are so nice, as well those who service the patients."
good,"deals with kidney patients, who have only a last chance to live, highly sensitive job. yet to grow in India, highly narrowed by foreign corrpution and prevention act"
good,davita is a fantastic place to be. it has taught me a lot about the medical field and has encouraged me to proceed with my career opportunities and goals.
good,Employees with the cualifications that iI have are no taken in consideration when new positions are open. They always hire people fron the outside. Positions are not ofered internally. I Don't think is Davita rather than the place that work at.
good,"I work in a fast pace environment, I learned a lot of medical information. I enjoy working with the patients, I have a great personality, very honest and a fast learner. I am in charge of the office, I do all the duties that has to be done to help the patients &     co-workers."
good,"DaVita can be a great place to work out when you first see the image they try to portray and how they sell you on the fact that they are a family first, company second culture. Unfortunately, too many people abuse the ""family"" aspect and try to get away with as much as they can, such as pawning work off on others, taking credit when they had nothing to do with the project, and even talking down condescendingly to you to make it seem like you are the one who is delusional. But for those who have a strong moral compass, they know when it starts to smell a bit ""bully"" if you catch my drift."
good,"During my 4 years with DaVita I met some really great people.  However, like most places, I worked under some not so great people."
good,"I learned a lot working at DaVita, and I look forward to leveraging the skills I've developed as I move forward to a new opportunity."
good,"I deal with patients sometimes in a bad mood or feeling down.I have learnt to be patient with my patients. I manage their frustrations by being patient, I try my best to get along with my co-workers. The death of my patients. The most enjoyable part of my job is when my patients comply with their fluid intake and when they get a transplant."
good,"DaVita is a place that talks up how wonderful it is. I've heard it described as a ""cult"" and that is a very realistic description. They expect you to BREATHE DaVita. There are a lot of ""chants"" and ""call backs"" that they ask you to do that I think are totally unnecessary. Also, they set up tons of very expensive events to help create this atmosphere, and in return, reduce pay scales of their employees."
good,"provide dialysis treatment, work long hours up to 14 hours since 3:45 am, the hardest part is when the clinic looses a patient due to death or transferring, the most enjoyable part of this job is the people I work with which some of them are very positive and hardworking like myself but this scheduled of going in so early to work is has really caused a lot of stress which has change me and of course my sleeping patterns and eating, thats why I need a new office job that has a better schedule."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"A typical day at work is not too stressful. There are a lot of things I've learned- coding wise,  especially internal medicine coding. Management is fair. Co-workers are nice. There is no ""hardest part of the job""  for me, I have done coding & billing for so many years and I enjoy doing it because of my expertise and knowledge in the field of my profession."
good,"Very rewarding assisting patients. "
good,"The typical day starts early in the morning and ends late in the evening. No day is the same. I have learned to keep a work and home life balance is VERY important. This was the hardest part of my job, not having much time for family."
good,"Unless you're a nurse, there's no promotions waiting for you within Davita. If you're looking for a job that will pay the bills with horrible hours and stressful conditions, then this is your place."
good,This is a very fast paced work environment.  The hours are very long. You have to be able to work as a team.  I enjoy the difference that I feel that I make everyday in my patients lives.
good,"Davita is a nice place to work,  it has nice perks including tuition reimbursement.  The hours are early and long. You must be flexible with your work schedule and with policies and procedures.  You work very close with the patients."
good,You basically worked 24/7.  Little support from management.  Loved work events and meetings. Loved my co-workers/managers.
good,"Great company core values and concepts. Poor advancement opportunities if you are not in the ""in-crowd."""
good,I enjoyed working here but the place is not run very effectively of efficiently. The managers all have no idea about how to train people in the proper way. Only the Home Therapies nurse took the time to train and she is very good at what she does. The rest of the management stepped into a place that they had seemingly no idea about any answers to any questions I had. After reviewing many different jobs as a journalist this one is by far the lowest in terms of management that I have seen in my 10 years of newspaper.
good,it was a very hectic and stressful job but very rewarding and does have the potential to move you up the corporate ladder. the hardest part of this job was knowing you were going to eventually lose your patients but it was very enjoyable getting to know them and getting to interact with the same patients everyday.
good,"Job was steady paced with good benefits. The staff was friendly and the office space was very clean and comforting. During my time at Davita I've scheduled patient appointments, filed, faxed information, took compliance classes and also ran then front desk by myself for a week."
good,"I loved my job at DaVita.  It was very difficult at times to do my job successfully due to the constant changes in supervisors, managers, directors and anyone who was assigned to oversee the records department.  I loved the fact that I was able to get many opportunities to get leadership/management training, build skills in project management, and develop the lead position from the ground up.  In general, the people whom I worked with at DaVita were caring, kind, compassionate and loved the goal of the business to save lives."
good,"If you are looking for a job that is very demanding and stressful for RN's then DaVita is the place for you! As a RN working in a Chronic Hemodialysis Unit, you have a lot of things riding on your nursing license each day. It seems that many nurses who have had disciplinary action taken against their nursing license, often find a job in dialysis clinics because most units do not have narcotics that are administered by the nurse. Upper management tends to be either caddy, click-ish, and/or useless other than knowing and sharing their official job title with others. You would think the health insurance benefits would be the best in the world but are not! You would think a CEO who made 25 million in bonuses last year could at least offer his employees the best health insurance in the world.... but instead... just CIGNA. :( Training isn't the best but you have the ability to make the most out of your job role if you desire to seek out the knowledge and know how yourself."
good,"Need qualified mangement. Hectic days, little flexibility on time off."
good,Enjoy working here but need advancement. It is the same routine at work; patients come in and we ask about the time we had apart and administer dialysis.  I have learned about diversity in the workplace and how people from different lifestyle and culture can come together with a single issue. My co-workers all bring something different to the table and I have learned something different from each of them. The hardest part of the job is losing patients. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping make a difference and in lives of our patients and realy becoming family.
good,I have to admit all things I have learned about the field have come from working here. However the fast growing company some times forgets the teammates behind it all.
good,"I have been at this company for 7 years as DaVita Inc and 4 years as Gambro Inc, and I have enjoyed working there, but I have the same title I walked in the door with. I am capable of much more than being a team lead of the systems administration and SAN teams."
good,"I don't have much anything to say when I worked at Davita for a short period of time except, doing my best to get the facility/clinic in compliance with CMS guidelines. I do not have any problem if the managers/upper management concern is the budget however the clinical aspect was poorly manage."
good,"DaVita does a lot for the employees fun wise. The host Christmas parties every year, we get offsite fun days anywhere the zoo or bowling you name it. We asked for a gym and a cafe they gave it to us these are the best parts of working for DaVita to me. Leadership and co-workers are the same as everywhere else, you have some people you get along with and some you don't. I try to get along with everyone because life is so much easier that way. I come into work 99% of the time with a smile on my face and in a good and I say my good mornings and go to my desk put my headphones on listen to my music and I get to work. I would say what I have taken from working at DaVita, there is so much and I have grown so much. I have learned to express myself way more. I have found I have an easier time talking to someone a complete stranger even. "
good,Davita is a great place to work currently under new managment and I believe that this is the worst part of the job. I love what I do and I am excellent at my job. The moral of the center due to new management is really low therefore Im looking to move on and hopefully find a noctural job that will best benefit myself
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Always something to do. Strongly encourage patients to travel and to not let dialysis keep them from having a full life.
good,"Long Steady Hours ,Stay Alert Fair Not Enough Team Player Losing a Patient Saving Human Life Showing that you do care"
good,The work hours were great and the money was ok not great and not enough and the management was horibal at the time dont know if they changed it yet.
good,Davita is a great company to work for. for the most part their employees live and breathe the Core Values.
good,"I worked for DaVita for 9 years. I managed different clinics throughout the years. My job was my life. I didn't have too many issues until there was a new Group FA assigned to my area. I think that she had some personal issues with me stemming from some past issues with some of her friends, and she made it very tough on me. When the demands she made became ridiculous and I basically told her that, she suggested that I may want to resign. I worked 60+ hours a week and never complained. I did what I needed to do for my patients and my teammates. It is sad when someone can basically ruin someone else's life over something that has nothing to do with the job performance. There is too much infesense of upper management to meet the budget, rather than look at what might be the best for the teammates and patients."
good,learned the field of dialysis. all aspects of a chronic setting
good,"Lots of chemicals, tests, mixtures and blood. I walk in, pick up the artificial dialyzers, take them to the processing room and clean them manually then electronically. I learned the proper way to mix bicarb, perform water system checks and of course process dialyzers. Management was fair. My Co-workers did not get along with each other and were racist. Hardest part of the job was being careful dealing with AIDs patients and patients with hepatitus. Most enjoyable part of the job was paperwork."
good,I enjoyed the three day work week and interacting with the patients and staff
good,"A typical work day at DaVita is about fifteen hours on your feet, but the work provides a sense of joy. While working with DaVita, I have learned how to give quality focused assessments and to provide detailed patient care. The downside is that due to the long hours and the demanding work culture, it is difficult to keep staff."
good,"look forward to working with people from different backgrounds. Be up for a new challenge everyday, and the work place model is have a great day. Be a people person work safe and smart."
good,Great company to work for. Many different facilities which gives a lot of opportunities whether you move or are just looking to advance your career. ..
good,It early hours and a hard job. That requires being on your feet long periods of time. But it is rewarding to give patient care. It requires a lot of documention.
good,the job can be hard but management does everything in their power to make sure that each teammate has what he/she needs to succeed. each day is a different day even though you do essentially do the same thing every day.
good,"The company tends to have very long hours per day for staff with no set time of completion.  In addition, staffing to patient ratios are not always safe or efficient."
good,I enjoy being able to take care of my patients and give them the care they need. I strive to make sure my patients are as comfortable as they can be in the situation they are as it can be a very stressful and difficult time for them.
good,love my job love my job love my working environment love my patients  love the company  love the work it’s always something new and different  it’s challenging
good,Great benefits but limited work-life balance. Many opportunities for educational opportunities including paid training in different states.  Depending on your location you will have flexibility in your schedule.
good,"The people I worked with were great! They were very good about helping out if you wanted to attend any educational conferences. However, I felt as though I was just a number and paycheck instead of a valued employee at times."
good,Over worked and underpaid. Great company to work for depending on what region you’re located in. Managers and supervisors only care about getting their bonus check every year.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,This company has very old technology when it comes to the machines and EMR system. The machines have at least 500K hours on them and as an employee you are expected to just deal with it. I’ve had situations where a patient lost their blood because of machine issues. It’s just fustrating. My coworkers are pretty decent and do work together to take care of the patients. Davita is definitely money driven.
good,"This was a good job. Started when opened a specialty dept. It was like we were learning along the way, even the supervisors. Everything was always changing."
good,Davita was a good place to work. The moment I started to see how people of color are sometimes treated in the institutions are ridiculous. This made me choose to end my employment.
good,"The center I worked at was nice and clean. Not so much the break room. "
good,"Davita doesn’t care too much about their employees, they will work you to death. They only care about filling holes and don’t care who it puts in a bind and the upper hands will not help."
good,"The company has great core values. They invest to their teammates to ensure they have the tools they need in order to become successful in their field. "
good,I kept busy assessing and admitting patients' and monitoring their progress adjusting to medical treatment. My constant discussion with patients' revolved around their physical and mental health and ways I could assist their overall well-being through referrals and/or therapy and updates of their status.
good,Not bad company but good luck with the staff. Most are set in there ways and refuse to give newbies a chance. Can make for a rough time in the beginning.
good,"21 years with this company. Learned great skills."
good,It is an average ok job. Middle management is poorly organized. Ninety percent of resignations are due to the Director 's persistent micro-management .
good,"My manager was horrible. The techs made the shifts go well. The patients were ok  . The shifts could be very long. Breaks could have been a little longer. "
good,it all depends on your clinic but mine was pretty awful only thing that made it bearable was the teamates but other than that they milk you till you cant anymore.
good,"Pros:"
good,"The benefits are great. They offer lots of opportunity for advancement. And, there is tuition reimbursement. Admin provides lunch regularly. They plan team building events for their employees."
good,"Okay job not a bad place to work at . Okay work life balance. Over time available at other clinics , every clinic have their similarities and differences."
good,"setting machines "
good,You have to be able to multi  task. time management is very important. Taking care of patients is enjoyable. not always having enough time to get things done.
good,"Typical day at work, start by preparing the machine then doing patient care. Hook pts on dialysis, monitor and end the treatment. I have two clinics, my first one is my training ground and I had a horrible experience because of the co workers and my preceptor. He's unprofessional and didnt do his job  to teach me well. SOme co workers are nice, but majority are NOT. My second clinic was better, however I do not have much schedule after holidays. Hardest part of job is dealing with annoying co workers. They have the best core values but majority dont live with it. You need to have a lot of patience in dealing with everybody. Both my FA are nice."
good,DaVita is a challenging work environment with great employee benefits however the hours are long and the work is very demanding. I would not recommend pct position to adults with kids.
good,"Cobram muito, e fazem pouco pelo funcionário."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,To start the day at Davita getting your machines ready and your supplies. Follow by getting your patients ready and their informations to start their treatment going.
good,DaVita has been an excellent first step in my accounting career. I have learned a lot about corporate culture and broadened my skill set exponentially.
good,Direct supervisor was great to resolve problems.  Required to have a heavy caseload with some long distance traveling.  Most of the day is documentation.
good,DaVita has an interesting culture.  If you join the company (what is referred to as a Village) is very unique than any other company.  There is no handshaking in the company only hugging.
good,is ok place to work keep me busy learning a lot of new things even is not my field to work but thankful for the job i can support my family pays the bills.
good,Davita is a great company to work for.  I have been able to gain great insight in the nursing field and working with different types of people with totally different types of needs.
good,"- Long work hours"
good,This is like every other company. It's the people you work with that make or break your particular place of employment. Otherwise average working conditions.n
good,"My experience working at Davita was great. I was chosen the shining star for the company. i got a chance to go to Denver colorado twice. I worked at different clinics all over new orleans, Luftkin Texas, Sulfir,Jackson Mississppi. It was a great opportunity for me. I want to be an travel ccht techincian. I had an misunderstanding with supervisor  thats the reason why i am not working with Davita I felt like I was treated unfair. Now I do not know what is being said about me because I am dependable and a hard worker on times got along well with co-workers and patients as well. I hope to get a chance to work for the company again I have 13 years of experience  and not giving another chance which is not fair. ."
good,"I love dialysis, fast paced. Manager ran a lot of of employees off. Benefits are good. Hours are tough. It's nice to only work four days a week. Five weeks pto."
good,"Overall compensation is poor for the teammates that are making the company money. Middle management is often in compromised position, pushing metrics as indicated by upper management who does not show compassion for our direct patient care teammates."
good,12-15 hours shift. Three times a week of work. A fun workplace different people you work with. It’s easy to relocate if uou are moving or transferring to different state..
good,The manager that hired me was great but then they hired a new manager with no previous dialysis experience and she ran the value of the compsjy in the ground. She had no idea what she doing and made decisions off personal feelings.
good,"CEO is full of garbage.  He is known as the Mayor of the Village.  3 Musketeers.  All for one and one for all.  Puke!!  Long hours, low pay.  In charge of 3 clinics.  More if a tech is on vacation."
good,Love the patients there I have learned a lot there is room for advance if you become a nurse. they will help with school if you decided to go and they offer 401k
good,"Work load is very great and never enough time to accomplish each task. All tasks are time consuming.  Time management is unlikely to help accomplish the workload placed on RNs, RDs, MSWs or the assisstants to the facility administrators."
good,"There are different hours for different clinics, depending on what hours you like to work. I started working m-f 4am-12pm, then transferred and worked 4 days a week 4am-4pm, transferred to another state and work 3 days a week 4am-8pm at the latest which I like. I have more time off and usually pick up another day at my clinic or another and the whole day is overtime. This company does have tuition reimbursement for those that want to go back to school and is located all over the country so you can move and transfer anywhere."
good,Upper management sets unrealistic goals and know nothing about what takes place within the facilities. Staffing and people quitting seems to be a constant issue.
good,Work days tend to be long but the patients make up for it sometimes with their sense of humor or smiles.  I could be getting paid more but I like what I do so I don't complain much.
good,Good place to work to gain medical experience. The days are hectic and the work schedule is rarely set. The patients tend to be nice but is not a good place to work if you are not a morning person
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Overall great environment to work corporate. However most of the jobs are based in Denver making it hard to move up in a position you might prefer outside of working straight claims
good,I worked for Davita for 7years and I would say that it has the potential to be a great place of employment for a young adult who does not have any children and who are interested in pursuing a career in the medical field. The positives they do offer tuition reimbursement and they train you depending on your FA and the Nurses you work with the environment can be great. You get to know many people both patients and staff. The negatives I was started at 9.00/hr no previous medical experience when I left 7yrs later I was at 12.15hr. The schedule is not flexible if you have children and also they need you to be present for work. I worked sick and had to lean on my family to take care of my kids a lot. So not a good work life balance. We were open on Saturdays worked every other if someone called in you would be asked to cover the shift. So having a dependable team staff is a must. Im thankful for the experience I got from Davita but I wish they had better work/life balance options and better pay for their employees because it is stressful and hard work
good,Great place to work!! I appreciated the opportunities available to grow within the company. They worked with my school schedule while I was furthering my degree.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact, help, and hopefully, improve the patients that I interacted with on a regular basis."
good,This is a company that you can grow in if not for the oportunity to enter the va I would have stayed with them they gave me a good opportunity and continuing dialysis.
good,"if you like to work long hours and less days a week, it is the place to work for. you get to know patients and their significant others because you see them weekly."
good,"I enjoyed my work and the patients, there is very minimal growth opportunity in the current market. The was the main reason I decided to pursue other employment outside of the company."
good,The job was great. I was a little frustrating when there were no patientes as I worked in the acute setting and if no one on dialysis was admitted you didn't have any hours.
good,On a daily basis you must stay motivated. Some employees will try to break you every chance they get and the company does very little to help a new member of the team. You have to have a passion for Dialysis to work for this company but on the other side you may be assigned to a great facility that is not as cut throat as the ones I was assigned to.
good,you deal with the same patients all of the time. They are old and debilitated. If you like working with this population then this job is for you. very repetitive.
good,"Dialysis is a field that you take day by day. Every day there could be changes, and you either love it and stay forever or you dislike it and find something new."
good,"Company really promotes having fun, however the structure of compensation for teammates and managers could be a lot better. Not a lot of room for advancement."
good,"I was lucky and had a great boss.  Upper crust management could be frustrating.    there is supposed to be continuity between how each clinic is run, but often very different depending on clinic size and region."
good,They had an amazing training program that gave me the confidence to apply those skills on the actual job. The workplace was friendly and fun. I was happy to work for a company that puts patients first.
good,"Facility Administration included nurse, manager, clerk, trainer, hiring and firing, interview, responsibilities included all areas of clinical work place"
good,Great place to work with great people.  It has been sometime since I worked there.  I got sick and had a lot of personal issues going on and had to leave the position I had
good,"Not fun to work, Very stressful Job. They expected you to work hard. They give a lot of workload which is makes you tired everyday of work.  You never enjoy working here because of overworked and less paid. every work you do  has a deadline which is suck!!."
good,"Working as a software trainer was fun, I really enjoyed going to work every day, including travel days. It is a heavily female-dominant environment which is hard to fit into if you are a male."
good,I've worked at multiple Davita centers. Facility administrator determines how the center is managed and enjoyed. Recognition of employees could use some improvement.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,the reason that i left Davita was because I had already gotten my license at that time but was still working as a PCT because there was not space for me to get trained as an RN. the RNs in the facility were always stressed and I could have used my skills to help them but could not because I was not trained
good,"If you like a fast paced job that'll require a lot of patience, dialysis is for you. The relationships developed are memorable and humbling. Helping those with renal failure is a gift."
good,There is a bit of favoritism that goes on involving promotions. They provide involvement from teammates for change and bettering the company for higher morale.
good,Decent place to work but can be short staffed at times.  Management changes frequently and staff not reprimanded when necessary.  Patient relationships formed were good.
good,As a charge nurse you are expected to be on the floor all the time and cannot leave the building. You are expected to manage 12 patients and a staff of 3 or more. You work long hours always on your feet. If you get sick it is very hard to call in since they tend to not have back up nurses.
good,Davita has long work hours. RN to patient ratio usually 1:26 or how ever many chairs your clinic has. Health benefits are not so good. They no longer give bonuses but match 401k and PTO not so good.
good,long hours.  call.  unrealistic manager.  enjoyed my patients and the doctors I worked with.  the opportunity to teach patients and staff was very rewarding.
good,constantly stressful due to the nature of the job. As a dialysis nurse the hardest part of the job is to see patients non compliant due to lack of knowledge about their disease process
good,"Overall, the management is a work in progress since there is a high turnover rate for both management and employees. The best experience that I had is when the company put us in a training program which usually last 3 months. They also provide a 1 week class which will help understand kidney disease and dialysis. This is very important if an employee is new to the field."
good,"There is always something new about DaVita that keeps you on your toes. The hardest part of the job is work/life balance, but the most enjoyable part of the job are the people that work there and care about the patients."
good,"While DaVita strives to promote what they view as an above-average company culture, the work/life balance is very stressful. In my experience, they encourage employees to take and enjoy personal and ""play"" time yet the work load is insanely unrealistic. The corporate structure is confusing and unclear: it is a nightmare to try and figure out which department handles what task. The on-boarding process for new employees is shamefully inept and frustratingly slow. A comprehensive overview of company policies, job application training, payroll, HR and benefit questions are currently non- existent; one literally has to track all of this information down upon being hired.  They do offer an ECO Pass for all full-time employees, which is an excellent perk if you must utilize public transportation to get to work. Parking is expensive and hard to come by. Depending on where one commutes from, DaVita is located in an ideal spot downtown with plenty of restaurants and things to do close by."
good,"some what fun, some what stressful. Not managed properly, people didn't care about the role and responsibilities they had. Some cared others didn't cared at all!"
good,I was an Intern at Davita for only a short period of time which I needed to complete a certain amount of work hours for my school license for MAA (Medical Administrative Assistant). During my internship I was taught to work different computer applications and also learned more about billing and coding for the procedures and tests used for patients on Dialysis. The environment was very professional as we had to constantly stay in contact with the different Dialysis Centers to manage the Patient's healthcare records for claims. The most difficult part of my internship was finding the correct number to the different departments associated within a particular Dialysis Center. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be apart of a Team that constantly worked hard which also had Team building activities that would alleviate stress and strengthen the bond between coworkers and the company.
good,"Workplace culture included ""having fun"" activities and was geared toward a younger staff.  A typical day at work included multiple meetings, making it difficult to get actual work done."
good,Work environment is clean and organized.  Team members collaborate and help each other.  Continuing education is encouraged amongst staff.  Very professional atmosphere.
good,The company is a great place to work. The management team is very caring and helpful. They focus on the teammate and go above and beyond to help them grow as an individual.
good,Management has been a revolving door. No stability. No work life balance. Over worked under paid. Biomedical Techs are treat like janitors and maintenance men.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"good training provided for new graduates, high patient to nurse ratio, feels overwhelming at times managing all the diaysis patients. The manager and CC make all the difference."
good,"Techicians are underpaid. The company has good benefits medical insurance, dental and vision. PTO accumulates every two werks. Paycheck are biweekly. Good working environment."
good,it was a great experience and one that I expected to serve as a transition into the hospital setting. My goal was to stay with this company at least 12 months and I will soon achieve that goal.
good,"DaVita talks the talk, but not all of the managers and directors walk the walk. My experience was extremely stressful and unfulfilling. In a short time, I got to the point that I dreaded my workday. Overworked and under appreciated."
good,You must be able to manage time properly and move at a fast pace to put on and take off patients from dialysis. You must also be able to understand the medications that the patient my be on that can interfere with their treatment.
good,"Loved my patients and co-workers, would of stayed there forever.  Unfortunately management kept cutting employee hours and staffing.  I was forced to work short staffed almost every day, which can be unsafe in a dialysis clinic.  Then when there was no time to finish computer work, I was forced to come in on my days off and not allowed to punch in due to the clinic ""budget""."
good,Getting to know patients and delivering compassionate care are the best part of my day. Tasks are repetitive and very hands on for training. You leave work knowing you made a difference.
good,DaVita is one of the better employers that I have been employed  by. DaVita sticks by it's core values and is a company that promotes education for their employees.
good,Overall fair place to work for my role. I enjoyed working directly with the patients. Other disciplines seem to fair much better if you engage in office politics.
good,Its a good start to the medical world. Its not for everyone. If You have no experience and looking for a career DaVita is great. They train you and lead you to the road of professionalism.
good,DaVita is a good company to work for. Fair pay and competitive. They offer healthcare benefits and other options for their employees to take advantage of.
good,Every review presents an opportunity to gain feedback about your business. Turn each piece of feedback into a constructive conversation by drawing attention to the positive aspects of your business.  It’s great to show that you are constantly listening and improving.
good,It is a great company to work for in theory.  just depends on which department you are in there is a disconnect between the field employees and the corporate side.
good,"not enough time to assess patients, too fast passed, not enough individual care to each patient, technicians overworked, worked over 12 hours and then reprimanded"
good,Most of the people I worked with were extremely caring and hardworking individuals. I was afforded flexibility in my position. You definitely needed to be a fast paced individual to work here.
good,It may be long hours but it is definitely rewarding. It is a job where you are continuously learning. I have been employed 6 years and I am still learning new things every day.
good,I worked there as an x-ray tech the hours are great. the pace is manageable. the co-workers were nice and helpful. It depends on what you like to do if you ll like it or not
good,"Dialysis is not for everyone. You either love it or hate it. I began to hate it, so I left. The company itself is ok, but atmosphere varies greatly from one location to another."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"This job I held previously was one not worth holding onto. Due to the management style, I was unhappy for more than half my time being unhappy but my most coworkers made it bearable."
good,Great place to work at if you don't mind not getting paid properly for the work you do. Anyone trying to get a first time job with a company this is the place
good,DaVita is a good place to work with lots of opportunities and great teammates. Many areas of the company allow for innovation and personal development not commonly occurring in companies of this size.
good,"Davita has offered a level of fulfillment in my role that I had not previously experienced. I work with talented, fun and caring teammates to bring much needed programs to our patients. The work hours are not for the faint hearted as it is a very demanding company where high performance is expected."
good,If you are single with not kids and want to make good money work in Acutes.  You have to be flexible and willing to work long hours a times.  You may also have to deal with rude hospital staff since you are contracted labor.
good,Clinic lacked manager extremely high turnover rate worked extensive hours without well managed breaks and schedules. Clinic manager up and walked out. they were trying though. Excellent benefits not bad pay.
good,"Initially during orientation seemed like a good company to work for, work days are more stressful than not.  Management seems like it all about the bottom line.  Most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers."
good,A typical day at work is very busy; Charge Nurse has to oversee PCT's and take care of 16 patient per 3 shifts. I have learned a lot being with the company. Management is ok. Not really crazy about the workplace culture. Hardest part of the job is working 15 hour days. The most enjoyable part of the job is taking care of the patients.
good,"Found a situation where people were eager to get you up to pace quickly, but the work load is hard.  I learned a lot while I was there but found the compensation a little less than market value."
good,"Working for HCP really provided me with a wide knowledge for patient care. Not all staff members weren't all that great to work with, I blame management for not seeking out the bad seeds."
good,"Day consists of administering dialysis,medications, education and case management  for approximately 36-40 patients daily.  This is split into 3 sessions of about 14 patient.  Patients vary in acuity.  Floor is very busy, multitasking is a must."
good,"The best part about the job for me was the ability to truly help the patients, not only with dialysis but mentally with patient education. The training at Davita is great I have no complaints. We lost our FA and was left without for quite some time, keep in mind we had 25 chairs full morning and afternoon 6 days a week.  It became very stressful on all of us and nobody seemed to care!! We begged and pleaded for help for at least a year until someone listened, they put a woman in the FA position who had zero knowledge of dialysis or any medical background. It was a nightmare... No one found that upsetting except the ones of us who were there breaking or backs trying to keep the place together!!! She tried her best but she didn't have a clue and was gone in 1 year.. needless to say, none of us who were working extra every week doing extra duties and just flat out working our selves in the ground got as much as a thank you, good job much less a raise and they were bringing in traveler paying crucial pay !! So no I have nothing to brag on management about at all. My teammates and patients I love everyone of them, the work I did, I feel like I was under paid especially when I see what the average CCHT  making.."
good,"A typical day is a fast paced day. I work for minimum 12 hours, mostly around 15 hours. My work and home life are not balanced what so ever. This is not a good job for a mother with children. I miss out on a lot of activities for school and sporting events. I do not feel like the pay is enough to be losing out on so much at home."
good,"Davita is an outstanding organization that attempts to exemplify its Core Values in all of its actions and culture.  The hardest aspect of working for Davita as a Facility Administrator is being able to balance both work and life expectations.  To be successful, you must be one who truly sets your boundaries and  expectations at the very beginning or corporate Davita will take advantage of you.  I am of the opinion that this is more prevalent on the clinical side of Davita than on the corporate side."
good,Long hours and on your feet for the majority of the day. Ok management. Best part of the job is the patients. The environment is very stressful most of the time.
good,With every job there will be ups and downs.  Every region is different.   My experience with them is great but the raises aren't good if you're not a nurse.
good,"Good place to start as an analyst, but not much room for growth. Fun culture, lot's of planned activities and fundraisers. At the same time, fun seems to be put ahead of actual work. Skills are learned slowly, so it's hard to move away from this company. Most end up staying or coming back because the environment is that much different from others."
good,The region that I worked in turned its back on the culture that made DaVita so special. It was no longer a patient first practice and retention rates of both patient and employee dropped significantly because of this. Consistent leadership was no longer relevant.
good,"I really appreciate the opportunity to enter into the Healthcare Industry through DaVita Healthcare Partners, but I was disappointed in leadership when it came to developing me further.  I asked for more and expressed my desire & passion to grow, but I was asked to keep doing the same."
good,"a typical day at work feels like you are underneath a microscope from having too many hands in the pot or chiefs in the tent. There have been too many changes in the past year. I have learned a lot about myself and have been able to better myself.However, there is poor communication from management."
good,"I begin most days coming in to the office early to make sure everything is ready for our customers. This includes making sure all phone lines are turned on, and all my systems are on and updated."
good,working at davita was a different work experience for me it was very challenging every day it was a tough job you worked on your own and had to go at a fast pace
good,"DaVita RxⓇ is the first and largest full-service pharmacy created specifically for the unique needs of kidney patients, and has expanded to other complex conditions as well. We make it easier for patients to get their medications and follow their drug regimens. We give providers a whole new way to improve patient DaVita Rx is a valuable partner to patients and providers in their kidney treatment. We make it easier for patients to get the medications they need and better manage their drug regimens. We also work closely with providers to help with insurance authorizations, watch for possible drug interactions and more."
good,Fast paced work environment the requires teammates to have the ability to to work independently but to also seek support as needed.
good,Davita Dialysis Clinic was a love hate job for me. Since I was the new one. I had no say. Even the mistakes of others were blamed on me. Which I did not like about management. But the staff was good.
good,"Self starter and hard working. Starting work at 5 in the morning and sometimes ending after a 16 hour shift. Setting up machines, hooking patients up to dialysis machines and monitoring while on machine."
good,"Working for this place made me realize that I needed to go back to school and get my nursing degree. There is little room for growth as a PCT, so I decided to gback to school and expand my knowledge."
good,"work flow is very much steady"
good,"Really good benefits, but hard to get time off work because of so much work per person.  Management has too much responsibility on their plate to do a good job overall.  Many co-workers feel left out of the loop at times."
good,Working as a technician is a difficult job yet it is rewarding. Working and caring for the same patients every day/week can be emotional and it is sometimes difficult to care for patients that are chronically ill.
good,The patients were the highlights of my days.  You become close with them and their families so it truly affects you when the time comes for them to move on.
good,"Poor leadership, reactive company does not value you middle management.  The company supports teammates, but middle management is expendable.  Clinical teammates have more value than non clinical teammates"
good,"Although the work days are long the job is very rewarding."
good,"Stressful, The patients were pleasant and kept the day going but the amount of job responsibility on the technicians was enormous"
good,"I worked for a outpatient clinic, patients are wonderful! I miss most of them. When there was a problem with a fellow nurse it was ignored. I sent a email to the area manager( higher than group fa) citing safety concerns as my reason for leaving. I was hoping she would call me to understand more, I never heard from her. "
good,"I am lucky to work closely with a strong, supportive team caring for our patients. Working with patients can be unpredictable, but together there is nothing we can't handle."
good,"Could be better staffed"
good,Working at davita was an interesting and fulfilling job but can't say enough about how the management are blind to workers that they have but don't value enough.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,is a fun and educational place to work hands on and fast pace. Lots of education and advancement opportunities. The patients are fun to get to know and help through there daily needs and treatments.
good,"a typical work day begins at 4am and consist of setting up the dialysis clinic for the day "
good,DaVita is built on great principles and ideas however currently not being practiced at my current location.   Overall DaVita is an excellent place to work.  My location needs a strong manger and more nurses.
good,Davita Dialysis is a very team focused company. Encourages training and education.  Management encourages a team atmosphere. Long hours and very repetitive work.
good,Great company with great core values and truly lives those core values. Very family oriented. Focus is on caring for the patients and serving our teammates.
good,A typical day is very fast paced but was all patients are safely on machines you get down time. I learned to be a quick learned and to be very calm and patient regardless if the other person is frustrated and is getting upset with you. The key is to stay in control. My coworkers are very help[ful. Hardest part of job is having to be firm with patients on there fluid intake considering everyone gets thirst and to not be able to drink has to be tough. The most enjoyable part is being able to help people continue on in their lifes
good,"I worked with a great team, must be a team player and work well with others. Must be able to work in a fast paced environment."
good,I enjoyed working here. I was able to put to use some of the things I learned in school. They have room for advancement. The workers seem to enjoy their job and are very committed to what they do.
good,"I learned a whole when I got into this new job. There was a lot to learn and take in just the first week I was there. I learned how to managed phone calls between dispatchers, doctors, patient's and etc. The hardest part was learning what was HIPPA and not. It seems like people had different opinion on what was and wasn't. The most enjoyable part of working is seeing the patients and talking to them. Sometimes they just want a listening ear after they're done with their treatment. One of the other hardest part of the job is receiving the phone call or being notified that one of the patient has expired that you have grown a relationship with. "
good,Cutting edge company but stressful environment. Fast paced very pushed. I did learn a lot about myself and areas for improvement that I am currently working on at this time.
good,"good company."
good,"I was hired as a data entry temp associate to complete year end claims. Company is nice, department was quiet and efficient."
good,There's job security but no growth unless you are buddy buddy with the managers. upper management rather place people with no experience in a position before people that have worked with the company for years.
good,I enjoy the dialysis environment..Ok company to work for...but company has cut hours for a full time employee from 40 to 30 hours
good,"Overall a good company to work for, however the benefits are less than stellar and the salary does not match the job requirements."
good,"Liked my management, but did not like upper management. Fun place to work, but expected us to stop working to do a work function to only have to go back to work and be completely behind."
good,"Fun workplace, great working environment, potential for growth within the company, tuition reimbursement , flexible scheduling and they ofer a bonus twice a year for meeting clinical goals."
good,Dialysis was not my forte.Very sad to see and be around.Co-workers were great.Management was ok.Dialysis was not actually what I wanted to work at but all in all it was good.
good,"Enjoyed working with Davita.  The patients were memorable. Saddened that due to the schedule and recently being a single mom, the schedule was extremely difficult for me to continue working there."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"89 patients as of now, with 12 hours duty. I learned a lot of things especially being the lab nurse and handling and preparing tubes prior to the lab collection day. Management is pretty unstable as of the moment since it has just expanded here in KSA. My co-workers are wonderful to work with, we compromise with each other and help each other to get through the day. The hardest part of the job is doing everything without an assistant."
good,"Monitor patients daily. Keep pt safe, monitor blood pressures, assist with ADL's. Give different Medications, collect lab specimens clean machines."
good,"As a charge nurse for a 12 chair clinic was challenging. Management was not always there to assist the staff if situations came up. Co-workers most of the time had the charge nurse back, but there were times when they were dealing with their own patients. It was difficult at times to make rounds with physicians when they came in to see patient due to my patient work load. The hardest part of the job was the making rounds, new start paper work and doing care plans at the end of the month. The most enjoyable part of my job was caring for the patient and working with my coworkers."
good,The culture is unique and fun but I don't feel they focus enough on growing people professionally.  It's nice to work in a relaxed atmosphere but sometimes it creates an environment where people forget to act like professionals.
good,"Early start and long days on my feet constantly. I learned a great deal from fellow coworkers and they learned quickly to rely on me. The most difficult part of my job was knowing that any day, a patient may not show up and we may never see them again. On the other hand, treating people 3 days a week, allows you to get to know them on a personal level and I have made many life long friends."
good,"good company, good people, nice transfers. great benefits/ fun loving company. very caring. anyone would enjoy it, very diverse"
good,Learned exactly how the dialysis machines and the effect it has on people. Such as low blood pressure. Also enjoyed my co workers explaining things to me when I had questions
good,this place was ok. haven't worked there in years so i am not sure how the company is now. so not sure if i can recommend. thank you
good,"Working with Davita Healthcare Partners was both challenging and exciting. I learned a lot in a short amount of time."
good,"Great, productive and team-oriented workplace environment.  The hardest part of the job is knowing that 90 % of the patient will never regain their renal functions.  Best part of the job is providing compassionate care to all."
good,"working at davita has taught me a great deal about patient care"
good,"DaVita asks for more from their teammates than they are willing to pay for.  As an insurance counselor, I trypically work about 60 hours per week.  I'm a salaried employee, and with the hours I work that translated to reimbursement of about $14 per hour.  DaVita does reimburse for mileage at $0.51 per mile, but this does not take into consideration the wear and tear on the car.  I typically drive anywhere from 300 to 500 miles per week."
good,"A typical day at Davita, is coming in setting up the dialysis machines for the patients to begin treatment.  Patients usually run anywhere from three to four and a half hours three days a week.  I have learned a lot about kidney disease and how beneficial and crucial it is to receive dialysis.  I love my team/co-workers. It is a very fast pace job, which I love as well.  The hardest part of my job is when patients get sick on the machines or get hypotensive and a quick response is necessary.  The most enjoyable part of my day is getting to know the patients and knowing that they appreciate me and what I do for them."
good,"Overall it's good cultural company, good patient care but not good for personal or professional growth. Lots of opportunities to improve the environment and technical team if management focus and hire right people."
good,"A typical workday consisted of four patients per technician.  You were to prep machine, set up supplies, and connect patient to machine all in a timely manner"
good,Davita as a company is a great company to work for. The Customer Support department is not run well by management. They can't keep a good manager. Mangement needs to tremendously improve and actually care about their teammates. They seem to forget if you have a happy team evryone will be more productive.
good,"take care of patients and patient safety"
good,"District was in a rebuilding stage and struggled with staff shortages."
good,DaVita offers a culture that looks to the future and works toward being the leaders in the industry. DaVita is an excellent company to work for and has opportunity for those looking to grow professionally.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Typical day at work for a RN: as a nurse the day can change in an instant. From coming into an office job to being pulled to the treatment area to assit the team with staff coverage. The most valuable lesson I learned working at DaVita is if you have a cohesive team, knowledgeable team, the day will glide by and even with issues they will go unnoticeable. As a manager, it is important to develop this strong team and ensure their are great players for each role. Many of the teammates in DaVita have become family. The most challenging position is the role of the RN. Dialysis patients can have very complex issues. It takes a strong RN to balance the floor and carry the ability to maintain her composure when there are many differernt issues flying his/her way. At the end of the day, the best part is being able to feel accomplished, high-fiving  teammates on the way out of the door. Each and every day is different and making the most of it is very important as an idividual."
good,"I learned many new skills doing inpatient dialysis.  I learned to not only do Hemo, PD, but TPE and CRRT as well.  I worked with an excellent group of Doctors.  The hardest part of this position was the inconsistency in the hours as acutes have no set hours."
good,"I didn't work here to long but it is a very fast pace and exhausting job, the best thing i liked about Walgreen's was that the store manager can hire, not a divisional hiring manager that will never see the employee again."
good,"A typical day at work includes performing  QA activities depending on the QA phase."
good,"Fun place to grow and learn. Davita is a great place to learn the medical billing system. Would recommend to a friend. Good co workers, and work experience."
good,"I have developed helpful skills through my past profession, especially through patient care. I have learned the importance of cooperation in a professional setting."
good,Good opportunities.  Clarification of job titles and roles needs to be more defined.  Clear development goals need to be outlined to increase employee fulfillment.
good,Tough to get fair development opportunities if not bought in for Redwoods program or from big 5 consulting firm.  Work life balance is rare.
good,"Could use some leader independence at the clinic level. My position was in an administrative capacity, but I feel the organization could have benefited more from the talents of the Facility Administrator, if she were given freedom to actually run her own clinic."
good,Salaries are for MSWs are set at a fair rate.   Helping PT to reach a higher quality of live is fullfilling. Co-workers and generally fun to work with.
good,Learned a lot from Davita/HCP in the 21 yrs I worked here. Pleasant and enjoyable environment.
good,Great place to work if you get the right manager. Good people who care about the patients they take care of. Hard to get your foot in the door.
good,Clinic setting was friendly and fast paced. Loved my co workers and patients
good,I work very hard on a daily basis. It is a decent place to learn the business of dialysis.
good,I enjoyed working for this company I enjoyed making a difference in peoples lives
good,A lot like the Army.  Employee manual has more pages than the policy and procedure manual.
good,forced to do non-important menial projects requiring me to work 70 hours per week keeping me away from family
good,"A typical day involves managing your patients and making sure they get on the machine on time according to their schedule appointments which can sometimes be the hardest part of the job. It can be the hardest part because sometimes technical difficulties evolve and theres nothing you can do about it. The most enjoyment part is the co-workers and conversing with the patients. I learned time management, organizational skills as well as communication skills."
good,Working in the outpatient environment requires long days on your feet.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Patient Care was important. I worked mostly for DCD until Davita bought our company in 2013. I felt that was time to move on to another company. DCD was a wonderful place to work both as staff and as management, it was a small company but it cared about both staff and patients"
good,"Clinical experience, working directly with patients."
good,patients were great miss them alot worked there for many years
good,this was my very first paying job and it was exciting because at the time Guess was a main stream fashionable store. Working as a sales associate helped me be more social and fueled my keen fashion sense.
good,"Basic job duties of a technician. Management needed work, did not stick to their core values.  I felt more of an individual rather then being a part of a team."
good,"Long hours, management could be better. Worked acute dialysis. Chronic setting may be better."
good,Budget out of wack. Poor staffing in most clinics in the region I worked
good,works starts at 3:45 or 4:00 am with mixing bicarb hooking up acid checking dialysis quality water setting up machines and testing them  gathering supplies needed for patients making sure all visual checks are done them cannulate patient monitor vitals assess patient over all educate and make the as comfortable as possible
good,"Fast-paced medical facility with a great team."
good,"By Following DaVita's Core Values, you will be a successful worker"
good,Corporate structure.  Applying Core Values within your own unit can make day go smooth.
good,"busy"
good,Difficult place to work short handedLong hours 24 hour call several days in a row
good,Allowed many opportunities to grow individually both personally and professionally
good,"A typical day working as a Sales Associate a Belk could entail suggestive merchandising, opening credit lines for customers, answering customer questions, completing customer orders, stock/inventory, and handling money. T"
good,This job is great for learning how to manage time and meet deadlines. The best part about the job was working 3 days a week typically a 12 hr shift. The employees know how to have fun in the work place and with the long hours that's a great thing to have.
good,"Work with hemodialysis patients and teach them how to perform their dialysis at home. Do patient teaching, education, draw blood monthly. Make rounds with physician. Do teaching for peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis. I also charge the in-center traditional hemodialysis unit. I am the infection control manager for the home dialysis department. I audit charts, monitor labs. Trend the data from the labs. Love working with a small amount of employees in the home dialysis department."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"I enjoy working for DaVita and have learned a great deal about healthcare and finance.  "
good,"Staff members are good people to work with."
good,Time goes by fast just manage it according to meet deadlines and on budget.
good,Good company to work for with opportunities. Getting to know patients and there families.
good,The patients are the reason I enjoy my job and will to help as needed. The management is ok and some of  co-workers I miss and would enjoy working with them again. I hardest part of this job is losing the pts. And the most enjoyable part is seeing your pts happy.
good,"Good place to work, very customer service oriented. Good company to work for.  Clinics are nationwide."
good,I enjoy ed working with the people. but the hardest part of the job was the traveling and the long hours.
good,"A typical day at DaVita included interacting and caring for patients, communicating with and directing technicians and LPNs, and attending to emergency medical situations. While at DaVita, I learned a tremendous amount about the challenges that a dialysis patient and their families go through. I also gained insight into the value of positive communication among staff. Communication with management was the most difficult element of this job."
good,"They do make you try to feel part of the team.  You're not co-workers there, but rather village people."
good,"Maintained office services by organizing office operations and procedures; controlled correspondence and designing filing systems. Patient check in. Greeting and directing patients. Answering telephones, obtaining insurance verification and authorization, and operating computer, fax, and copy machines."
good,"DaVita was my first home in dialysis. I enjoy working with patients, I kept myself busy all day long. I always find something to do. Dialysis can be stressful but I managed my stress levels pretty good. "
good,Davita has a 2 thumbs up on their mission and core values. Their core values include fun and really knows how to brace their mission
good,"i was there to observed during clinical rotation, i only did observation, but am able to perform PD."
good,love the company... just depends which region you work for.  
good,"went to be a very unsafe place to work at.i felt a lot of unfairness.,the company picks on the good empoyers,and really need to foucs of the bad empoler"
good,This company has very strong beliefs to promote within. Nonlicensed teammates to management postions. Just be careful you dont get caught up in other peoples shadows or you will never been seen for the GREAT job YOU are doing...
good,"In the past 30 years I have gained many experiences, to include venopuncture, IV's, accessing fistulas and grafts. I enteract well with many people and have a peaceful continence. I enjoy people and enjoy working in a group setting."
good,"Salary is not the best and no 401k match. However, culture and people are great. Company needs to work on retaining employees though as many people are leaving for better opportunities at other firms with better compensation packages"
good,"good place if you are single, no kids, and would like to gain experience. maybe it was just the timing of my employment and new management but i rather not comment."
good,"If you can survive the office politics it's a great place to work. IT is really intense, no room for error."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Set up machines according to policy. Review schedule, client chart, greet them and begin my day of dialysis. the hardest part of the job was when the clients where coming off the machine and the next shift of clients where going on dialysis. I think it would be safe to say that most dialysis centers are busiest at shift change."
good,excellent business model and target market... sad but true
good,"nice environment,lots of different personality, but manageable to work with, the hardest part is getting up in the morning, most enjoyable is to see the patients happy."
good,Early start. Can be long dys putting patient on and taking off dialysis machine
good,"Busy, learned abut Re-use in dialysis."
good,"I start by preparing the supplies for the day to help the day go smooth. then we let the patients come in and its 2 of us taking care of 13 patients connecting them to the machines. To me the hardest part of my job is cannulating the patients I don't like to see them suffer I wish there was another way of doing dialysis, besides putting those 14 and 15 gage needles in there arms or legs.I try play the radio I let them hear the oldies but goodies or listen to 94.7 the wave and it relaxes them , I just try to help them get there mind off of what they are there for, at least for a while."
good,Davita is a great company to work for. Your teammates are truly who learn from.
good,Fair and good salary. Very good boss. She left shortly after I did for a different position at Davita Home Dialysis but it did not work out & she left the company.
good,"DaVita is an amazing company to work for, don't get me wrong its hard work but once you get the hang of everything, you'll fall in love with what you do and all you'll want to do is perfect you're craft to ensure patients' get the care they want and need."
good,"Well compensated, many locations to work from. Support from manager and other staff members. Opportunities for advancement in careers. Tuition reimbursement."
good,Immediate superviser did not do his job properly. Was rude to fellow employees. He was a terrible boss who played favorites.  Was two-faced with patients & ordered office supplies on company's dime to pay for supplies for his son's football team.
good,"12-16 direct reports and ~100 indirect reports; moderate/high travel based on geographical locations of clinics within regional area; lots of time spent in live meetings and on conference calls; responsible for overall regional performance in all clinical, financial, and growth metrics."
good,Environment loud in pt area.  Loud music played in pt area.  Weak management.  No place for a quiet person who is sensitive.  Will not know work schedule beyond one week.  This job is for a loud and hardcore person to survive.
good,"Rat race all the time. Plan to work fast and hard. You can make it a ""special place"" if you can get your whole team involved, motivated and organized. You truly are saving peoples lives ALL the time."
good,You care for 16 patients at one time.  You just pray that nothing will go wrong due to the fact that there is only one floor nurse scheduled at a time.
good,"Helping the patients gives you a sense of pride for the work you do so anything after that was just icing on the cake.. accolades or thumbs up from supervisors etc. Which wasn't hard to come by because they had a Town Hall every month, Happy Hour after hours. Superbowl Parties etc. The work culture was amazing. No worries about coming in during ice storms. The office would close for the day and you still got paid. Amazing job but the pay could be better to match the cost of living in the Area."
good,"The pay is exceptional, I love working with my coworkers. The work can be a bit intense. However, at the location that I work at  the management suck unfortunately that is  deal breaker for me."
good,"Day started at 4:00 with making perfect osmotic water - and if not perfect, immediate death to patients. Perform dialysis on multiple patients throughout entire day. Bleach all equipment with extremely fast turn around for next patient. Continuously monitor multiple patients at one time knowing that within seconds a patient can code."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Cons: Early start time (early as 3:45am), low pay rate, High turnover, no downtime."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the patients and putting a smile on their faces and when someone receives a transplant. The least enjoyable is Leadership.
good,"When poorly trained inexperienced dishonest administrators are hired it is dreadful for staff.  If you are lucky those administrators leave and a good ones with experience with people skills  are hired.   Making it through  poor management  is life changing, and you will appreciate your good FAs even more."
good,"I was fine during training and eager to start in my clinical setting. I was warned about the clinic by patients that it was ghetto. I was told, go to work, mind my business, and WATCH MY BACK because the women there were cliquish and will stab you in the back. Ding ding ding, $10000 goes to the patient who warned me. They appeared very nice and didn't seem to mind me asking questions but would go to the FA complaining about my mistakes and minor things when I told them to tell me my rights, my wrongs, and what I need more teaching on. I lasted in my clinic about 3 weeks and quit. I need peace at work, not a place where I can't ask questions to LEARN and advance and most important FOR PATIENT SAFETY. I have never done dialysis before and they should remember they were once in my shoes before so the questions and mistakes were going to come. Guess it's not a specialty for me or was it my environment?"
good,"Good company, benefits are good. Pay is a minimal at best and it’s a non compete company. The atmosphere is amazing and everyone seems to get along. Seems mostly transparent with everyone."
good,Culture is great. DaVita is overall a great company to work for as they invest in the teammates through continuous training and development. Some top leaders are micro managing.
good,"Overall, DaVita wasn't a horrible place to work. Benefits package was competitive compared to others in the industry, paid time off was comparable, and they really promoted FUN in the clinics. My biggest struggle with DaVita was there drive for financial outcomes. All conference calls seem to fall back to the bottom dollar versus the patient. Too many times being asked to work understaffed, though still within MINIMUM standards, so the clinic could ""make budget"" that week or month, Very very little work life balance as they ask continually to spread yourself more and more thin whilst still meeting all clinical and financial metrics. As an RN, or PCT, the company may be appealing as all of the above mentioned falls into the facility administrators lap instead."
good,"A typical day of work is fast paces and you need to be able to Get Stuff Done and a lot of it. From a insurance specialist role the work is "
good,"Prescription Verification and Phone Pharmacist.  "
good,"Hardest part of the job is that you have to work in front of a computer screen and resolve insurance claims. The work gets tedious and repetitive, but the people and the company really embody fun."
good,"The hardest part of this job is the stress of initiating and terminating tx in a timely manner.  The number of restrictions has increased recently, making it more difficult to accomplish the things that need to be done prior to tx initiation more difficult."
good,"Many reviews and feedback are provided, but it is difficult to determine how to best go about growing. You can follow through on the feedback, make behavioral changes, but, if you are not ""seen"" then you do not get promoted. This seems to have changed in recent years."
good,The Values promoted was awesome that's what attracted me.  At corporate meeting your cup was filled.  Once back at home site I felt I was let down.  My area manager over our group was not about filling your cup but emptying it.
good,"I have no real opinion at this time. i worked for several different units. i was original hired in Brooklyn for the Shepshead Bay Facility,"
good,"DaVita does inspire great team work, but I feel they over work there employees. "
good,Fast passed job teammates are family good benefits pto and 401 k good insurance have to be at work at 4am work 12 plus hrs usually 4 to 5 days a week they will train takes at least a year to be proficient
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Davita is a very big company. One advantage is that you can relocate since the company keeps on buying dialysis centers although the patient census is low. The company pays less but has perks though.
good,It's a fast pace working environment. I always learned something new every day. With a good group of managers. The hardest part of the job is there's a lot of things to do which i love because they're all challenging and too little time. And the most enjoyable part of the job is when I solved or fixed the problem because it's satisfying to me.
good,"I believe that DaVita has taken pretty good financial care of me over my long 15 year career with them. They have decent benefits and they just started matching 401K contributions this year. The part of my job that I enjoyed the most is the fact that I am able to work my own hours and make my own schedules. I am currently covering 3 facilities, so it is important that I am available to address any problems at these facilities at any time. The part of the job that I enjoyed the least was the 24/7 on call that was required. Unfortunately DaVita does not compensate you for your time on call (only time worked if call in after hours.)"
good,I enjoy my job but it's fast pace and unorganized. Some people aren't team players. We have a lot to do in a short amount of time. Management pick and choose when they want to take the techs side.
good,Time management was out of control! Employees are worked to hard. Company treats employees like a number. Patient care could be improved. Need patient/employee to be smaller.
good,This company refuses to adequately repair of replace water room issues.  It takes a patient to complain to the state before management even huddles for a meeting and then it's only to cover their butts.
good,"Growing too fast. Trying to have everyone wear too many hats. No work/life balance. This company attempts to help people grow, They are dedicated to teammates and inspire all to take advantage of the many opportunities available."
good,"This company has a lot of pros and cons, but the thing that is consistent is the micro management from corp. They have unrealistic expectations of what they want you to do on a day to day basis."
good,Fast paced on feet all but one hour a day. Enjoy the patients. Long days but usually only 3 days a week. Every other weekend. Learned a lot and continue learning.
good,"DaVita has been a completely new experience for me as far as work goes. They have a fun atomosphere - events and meetings are held constantly as a way to keep everyone engaged and united. There are a lot of clicks, and management does tend to favor people who they have closer relationships with. I would say overall it has been a fun experience, but I do think they should pay higher and give promotions to people who deserve them."
good,"I am a contractor at DaVita. It took several months to get any work to be given to me. In that time I was counseled many times to ""appear"" busy even though they refused to give me work, because ""it's all about what people think"". Great. Then when I got work, I was slammed with it with very little help or direction from management. I was basically set up to fail from the very beginning and was sold a bill of goods from what I was told in the interview to what was actually going on. I'm not thrilled."
good,"Healthcare is always changing.  It is also challenging to keep people, drive outcomes, deal with patients, and doctors.  "
good,DaVita Rx supplies medication for dialysis patients. My job was to provide co-pay statements to patients to help them receive financial aid for housing and/or tax relief.
good,"management is poor, very difficult to receive vacation, have to wait 6-8 mo to receive approval. Difficult relationship between staff, management encourage complains for each others. Staff every day different, very often not responsible"
good,"Multi-tasking at it's finest.  Almost no one has one job any more.  Often when people leave, they aren't replaced.   I have developed some strong professional and personal relationships which makes the constant ""do more with less"" culture more tolerable."
good,"I LOVE the field that I am in (healthcare). I greatly enjoy interacting with my patients and coming to work knowing that I am making an impact. I did not choose this field it truly chose me, and we work well together!"
good,"Busy, always on the move, learned how to handle symptoms of low blood pressure and how to correct the situation.  Workplace culture unacceptable at times due to tolerance of unprofessional behavior allowed to occur without consequences.  Management is trying to stabilize the job environment, but is mostly in crisis management mode.  Hardest part of job - dealing with disgruntled patients reacting to staff shortages.  Most enjoyable part of job - building rapport with patients."
good,"Hard work"
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,We had an amazing team working hard to complete our work on time. One day everything changed when new managment came inand moved our office to far for us to work at.
good,"its a professional environment depending on the department you are working the stress level can vary. The clothing attire is very relaxed. they're a young company still tweaking and trying to make it a better company. They count tardies and Absences as the same thing. This is something i did not like, there attendance policy is one that need to be re-looked at. when life emergency come up unexpectedly they are not excused even with a MD note. which is leaving you having to worry about your job. but other than that good place to work. Different cultures."
good,"Kidney care is an expanding modality. There is a continuous need for nurses, patient care techs, and management. With that being said once hired potential advancement in the organization is endless."
good,"Good environment and co-workers but raises aren't that great."
good,"Full-time hours in 3 days. OT always available. Employee wages on low end. Must have a lot of energy to do this type of work. Work load overbearing, hours too long."
good,"It's a good company if you like working in the health care industry. I would probably have stayed if I could have passed the state exam. They took away  the 403 retirement and put profit sharing in its place, which I thought was unfair."
good,"I start the day reading, answering and following up my emails. Once done I review my outstanding workload and prioritize them based on deadlines. What is challenging thou is that there are instances when I need to change the priority I set for a more urgent project and go back to my original timetable. What I have learned is that a person needs to be flexible and be ready for any changes. The hardest part of the job as most jobs is making sure that deadlines are met. This would mean working longer hours either at work or at home. But the most fulfilling part is able to deliver the project needed on time. This company is a nice place to work. Teammates are helpful and friendly while management keeps us updated on what is currently happening and direction it is going. The company gives us the opportunity to organize fun events to temporarily get away from our work"
good,Good company that cares about patients and employees. Bonus programs. Uniform ordering. Workload is not overwhelming.
good,So far I have enjoyed working for DaVita Dialysis in the setting of acute dialysis treatments.  Working at two of Philadelphia's most well known and respected hospital facilities continues to challenge my skills as a Magnet Status Clinical Nurse.
good,"Learned a lot with davita, long hours but small pay. lots of overtime if you are willing. great place to start in the medical field."
good,"Stable company to work. Supportive management. Get along with people really well. Fast pace environment.  The most enjoyable part is dealing with co-worker. I can't want to the next day working back, huddling with my team.  Create something that will benefit our company, and boss will say JOB well done."
good,"it is real difficult to become a teammate with full benifits, they try to keep you on as a temp as long as possible where you cant get insurance, bonuses, and time off."
good,Typical day here is sitting on the phone and listening to customers giving their information bout their illness. Co-workers were really nice made the easy to get thru.
good,"Salary and benefit structure are not industry-leading. In fact, DaVita offers no employer contribution to 401K but instead offers a cryptically calculated quarterly potential bonus based on clinical outcomes with each individual does not have input into. Additionally, the bonus is taxed of course. "
good,"like the work I do patients thought of as extended family"
good,Good company to work for with plenty of opportunities to advance within the organization for those willing to come in and focus on work and attention to detail. Starting salary is average to below average in my opinion.
good,"Being in the healthcare arena, the daily ""grind"" got to be very tiring. The pressure to perform day in and day out, did not allow much time to relax and/or enjoy what you did. Co-workers were generally too busy to interact with each other outside of doing their respective jobs."
good,"Not a bad place to work, the patients are the best part of the job. Getting to know them and helping them out is the most rewarding part of the job. Being able to help save lives and put a smile on their faces makes coming to work worth it."
good,"More work than pay.  I like my team and the patients, but I feel that I am overworked and underpaid.  The boss told me one day that ""Everyone is doing extra work"" Yes that's easy to say and understand coming from the one person in the entire facility that makes more that everyone working in the facility."
good,"4-12 hour shifts with varying levels of difficulty"
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Co-workers all for themselves, their is no teamwork. Shift change is chaotic. Computer charting system terrible. Face paced environment."
good,"12-hour shift assessing patients and giving dialysis treatment"
good,"I look forward to helping the patients get through their dialysis treatments mentally, physically and emotionally on a daily basis. I've learned to be patient, to listen and also to be alert and aware of my surroundings at all times. I work well with my coworkers and have a great rapport with the patients. At any given time they know they can come to me and ask me for anything work related. The hardest part of my job is knowing these patients are uneducated when entering into dialysis for the first time. I think patients should be educated prior to starting dialysis when diagnosed with Renal Disease. The most enjoyable part is knowing I helped someone get through another day whether it be patients, staff or family members."
good,"This is a good company to work for, but the long hours are draining. A person could easily work 14-20 hours in one day, 2 times a week. Management is good and the people that I have worked with are nothing but helpful and understanding. I would say the most enjoyable times are when I am working in the unit with the other co-workers and talking with the patients while on dialysis."
good,A typical day is can be pretty unpredictable. You can be working on one thing all day or bouncing from project to project. Through this position I have greatly sharpened my Excel skills and I hope to take those improved skills and apply them back to an accounts receivable position.
good,"I love my counterparts and the clients we worked with. However, compensation, benefits, advancement, recognition, was very low and hard to attain. There was a lot of turnover in my department in less than 2 years."
good,"The culture is unique with songs and fun things to keep employees engage and active. Management on the other hand seems to remain stagnant if there is no room for growth. At least with teammates (co-workers) in the business office. Compensation is not the best, no matter how hard you've worked, increased number of hours over time, you will always get the same 1-2% raise at the end of the year."
good,"DaVita has great core values, but it depends on upper management how things actually run."
good,Fun work place but their values for customer service has gone down
good,I learned a lot about other professional roles in the dialysis field. Teamwork and accountability are used a great deal in the Indianapolis region. Upper management is sparse.
good,"I loved working with the patients, doing patient teaching, assessments, but it was a very difficult job.  We were expected to do dialysis on three sets of four patients per shifts.  The treatments were scheduled to close together and it was very hard to get the patients off and on the treatments in time scheduled by the clinic.  The other really hard part of this job was that you see the patients three times a week for treatment and you get to know the people.  Eventually what happens if they dont get transplant they die.  I became very depressed and went through a period of grieving for the patients I lost.  That is why I looked for other employment and went to work at the hospital."
good,Davita is a very good place to work for. management is very good as well as the teamates at davita.
good,hard but it was a job.
good,Loved the job . Interact with Dr was trying at times and management would not deal with problem. Pts most enjoyable part of job
good,"A typical day is working with 12 patients for 12 hrs. Administering medications with patients. Poor working relationship. I find people having crab mentality, meaning like they put coworker down inorder to be recognized by the manager. Employees were not evaluated depending on the performance but depends on your rapport with the Manager."
good,The firm does not offer a 401k match and vacation/sick days/holidays are grouped into one PTO bucket (22 days for new hires). There is a profit sharing plan but that only kicks in if certain profit goals are met for the year.
good,Some days are crisis management all day and some days are a slow steady pace to catch up.
good,"crazy work hours, work with unprofessional teammated. give great opportunities for advancement...……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"I receive better pay than I had with a competitor. Benefits and pay are better than other local medical facilities, but the job is higher stress. If you hang in there and build your skills and get certified, there are limitless opportunities for employment. Lots of opportunity for career advancement and the best tuition reimbursement around (They essentially pay all tuition for nursing school)."
good,"Employees are easy to get along with, team work takes really good role on Davita. Communication is pretty much daily basis. Learning how to take care of my patients"
good,"DaVita depends on the facility you work for and the FA you are involved with. If your FA is great, then all is good. If your FA lacks in leadership, it's hard to get things accomplished."
good,I really enjoyed my time there I learned a lot I also got a promotion so my time there was well spent I met some very loving and caring people  there   . If I had an opportunity to work there again I would.
good,"Overall DaVita is an ok place to work. There are some good leaders, and if you're lucky to be under 1 of them, then you may enjoy your time there. However overall I feel the leadership at Davita is lacking. The company has good ideals but more often then not, they're not followed and therefore lose meaning."
good,"Good company but too much work. They love to add initiatives without removing any job duties. Work is great if you have a good Administrator. High caseload, must cover multiple clinics if your clinic has low census. A lot of case management, little social work. The team in the clinic is what makes this job good."
good,"When I worked at this company there was many issues with following guidelines, federal violations and questionable medical practices. If the company did not have problems with following CMS guidelines, I would have probably stayed at the company. I however left because I was in fear of my license being revoked due to following the companies guidelines."
good,"I learned a lot in a short time, very fast paced. I had days I loved it and days I went home praying for another job in a different field. Each day is different and the same at the same time."
good,"Job with fun work culture, but unpredictable work hours resulting in lack of work life balance and frustration. Compensation is above average but working as a specialized dialysis nurse often results in rapid burnout of the job."
good,"In beginning, Davita was exciting, fulfilling, and demanding but fun and challenging.  Hours are now cut, lack of communication between manager and team."
good,DaVita has been a great start to my nursing career. I have acquired many new skills. This is a company where personal and professional growth is available to all the people who are willing to put in the effort.
good,"As with any work place, DaVita has its challenges. But if you are committed to providing optimal care to patients with chronic illnesses, and love helping others, as I do, DaVita is a good place to work. As a social worker who loves making a difference in the lives of others, I consider myself a servant of the people. So focusing on patients' needs, I accept challenges, engage patients to work with me [and the staff] and collectively as a team, we get things done in the best interest of patients/families. My biggest challenge is establishing a working relationship with new patients and families. Once I've convinced patients that I was there to serve and help them meet their needs things started to fall in place. Yes DaVita, as any other healthcare agency has it challenges, especially trying to provide optimal care to patients when health benefits keeps decreasing, the cost of medicine increasing, and resources continues to get cut or discontinued. But somehow, the DaVita Team keeps providing good care, while I continue to educated, encourage, and motivate patients to take charge of their lives by focusing on their role in the health care process in order to achieve the highest level of quality of life possible. All I can say is that retirement was a very emotional decision for me, as I was missing the patients and the DaVita Team, including the doctors."
good,"DaVita is a village of people.  You can't help but make friends, and get to know the patients.  That's what I loved about the place.  It's the feeling that I am helping people.  However, DaVita has changed some though in the last 8 years.  The benefits, bonuses, and incentives have been cut.  The health insurance is Cigna, which is not a very good carrier in our area."
good,Meaningful work and really great team to work with. IT systems need more advancement in order to be world class and keep innovation moving forward. Overall the company tries to live by the core values but in recent years they're starting to slip.
good,Teamwork at Davita is exceptional and very unique culture. Davita is doing a tremendous advancement in ERSD diseases especially with patients on dialysis treatments.
good,"Dialysis technicians assist people with kidney failure. Dialysis Technicians work primarily in hospitals, outpatient clinics or in home dialysis settings. They may also have titles of dialysis tech,renal dialysis technician, hemodialysis technician, and nephrology technician. "
good,Good Benefits. Flexibility in work schedule. Communication with different departments in the company is not very good. Travel between clinics may be required.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,As soon as you walk through the door you are automatically setting up your work stations for the day. Within the next 30 minutes patients are walking through the door. You have 15 minutes to get a patient cannulated and hooked up to the machine along with pre-vitals and other important health related information. Once you have all of your patients on the machine (dialyzing) you monitor them every 30 minutes. After treatment it can become stressful due to the fact some patients maybe ending treatment at the same time and you may have to go back and forth with each patient until they are all ready to leave. Once a patient has left you have another patient to start all over with for treatment. I learned how to multitask in a stressful environment. I really enjoyed meeting new people and helping increase their life expectancy. The hardest part of the job was feeling like the company was more concerned with saving money then really giving the patients one on one attention.
good,"In the RN in-center hemodialysis world, everything is fast-paced. There's never really a moment to rest or take a breather. Once the day starts, it really doesn't end until 12 hours later. That's everywhere. "
good,"We always say that work is our second home which is true"
good,"My position was acutes, my lifestyle changed was unable to meet the demands as an acute care nurse. Job can been rewarding. Staff somewhat distant due to the work environment as an acute nurse your left usually on your own. So must be an independent work with strong critical-care experience."
good,My typical day started at 5am and ended at 7pm.  There was a report due at 8am and data was not available until AM.
good,"I love the culture of the job, just really not impressed with management. We are always short staffed which makes working conditions very stressful. Experiencing burn out is very common. Management is not interested or caring about anything that is going on in your life, they only care about when and how much you can work. Experienced several times from management what seemed like harassment if I would call in or if they needed someone to come in and work. The patient's are wonderful and have become what seems like part of my family. Just wish DaVita cared more about their teammates and had more of an effort to make sure that we are appropriately staffed."
good,A typical day at work is putting patients on the treatment machine and making sure that they have a successful treatment. Once treatment is done to make sure their vitals are stable to stop treatment. Report all findings to the RN. Everyday I keep an open mind on the job for learning new things about the Dialysis treatment and the patient. Management needs improvement in regards to following protocol with other teammates that do not follow Medicare and medicaid regulations. The hardest part of the job is hearing news that a patient past away. The most enjoyable part of my job is making my patients laugh.
good,"Upper management did not care that there were staffing and supply shortages,unless they just ignored the problems. Outcomes were still expected. Facility Administrator and teammates at the facility where I was employed were absolutely wonderful. Loved the patients"
good,Not the best company to work for. The office culture was fun and there were more than enough people to get to know but it just struck me as a cult. If you were not accepted into the circle you were left out in the cold.
good,"Davita is a good company to work for in a typical day I started work at my desk with a computer. My lead would assign work of patients who insurance benefits needed to be verified and set in their file.Patient Demographics were also verifed and checked for accuracy. "
good,"long work days 12,14,16 hour shifts 4 to 5 days a week became to much for me. I would go in at 4 am most days and on an average get off at 6pm to 8:30 pm at night then have to do the same thing again the next morning while managing a home with kids single parent. didn't work for me"
good,Could be better but not the worse. Profits have become the main objective -- company pushes for high DOQI outcomes while at the same time most facilities are under staffed and staff is pressured to work faster to maximize company profit.
good,"DaVita prides itself on its culture and has a great flexible work schedule and work/life balance."
good,"I didn't work directly with DaVita, I was a Contracted Illustrator. I would design illustrations for medical pamphlets from home and email them to the Marketing Manager. I don't know what it's like to actually work there, but I enjoyed my experience with them."
good,"It was ok to work here time of work got to be a bit much, the pay raises are not that much (don,t match cost of living) Just time for a change for me, thanks"
good,"DaVita manages costs extremely well and is financially stable.  There is room for growth but be prepared change geography/specialization or both to grow.  The compensation for PCT's, RN's and FA's is low relative to work-  Directors and above earn competitive salary.   The culture attracts passionate and fun professionals."
good,"The people I work with are incredibly hard-working and care for their patients. The organization incorporates fun into the work days, and are very flexible."
good,Loved my 17 years of service with the company. My position changed often over the years and I had to learn to adjust to 8 different Regional Directors during my time as Regional Coordinator. Was sad to see the company downsize.
good,"The job itself is amazing, but the supervisor is not that great .she is hardly available for her workers. And patients don't like to see her coming. But over all place is great."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Amount of work that is expected to be done is not compensated well. High turnover r/t pay. Always work to be done which is a good quality for the days to go by quickly, however, can become exhausted. Positive being able to work with good coworkers."
good,"DaVita will tell you you are a valued employee.  If you work in one of the clinics, it's more true than not.  However, as an accountant, you are completely replaceable.  "
good,Very busy. Monitored 20 patients at any given time plus supervised staff. The days were long and hard but at the end of the day my patients were my reward. t felt good to make them feel good.
good,"12 hours work day. Learned about different aspect of the clinical. Management need to support the team, lack of leadership from management, no advancement. Coworkers are great to work with. Hardest part of the job is working long hours. Most enjoyable about the job is the patients."
good,Working for Davita is always fun and enjoyable. My team always maintains open communication amongst ourselves on how to work more effective and efficient so we can deliver safe and quality care to our patients.
good,Enjoyed the travel and ability to work on special projects.  Also enjoyed the flexibility and the ability to work from home with a home office.
good,Great corporate culture - work life alignment challenging. The company does like to promote from within. Compensation packages are fair and competitive.
good,"Great place to work if you're looking for advancement. Many positions In the company. Love the environment, definitely different than any place worked before. Your referred to as teammates and part of a community."
good,"i think that this company should be mor patient centered/  Proveide resources that are geared to the client,  There is a great need for education  and direct care of the patient."
good,Never know what your hours will be from the minute you get to work til the minute to leave. Management doesn't seem to be there for the staff.
good,"Hard work, on your feet all day long.  I learned that some dialysis patients are the meanest people.The management sucks.  Some co-workers are unreliable.  Too many people calling in late or calling out for work.  The hardest part is working 10 or more hours a day,  The most enjoyable part of yjr job is prolonging patients lives"
good,The work life balance is not managable. You will find yourself working 50 plus hour work weeks
good,"Appeal and resolve claim rejections, underpayments, and denials "
good,"I care more for those bed bond,and helping to care for elderly"
good,"Busy workplace providing dialysis to patients with end stage renal disease. My job was inventory, procurement, assisting medical staff by obtaining information and reports, creating needed forms, and keeping computer information updated."
good,"Calling patients as soon as I got to work."
good,Start of my day starts at 5am.  Davita has taught me how to manage my time well.  My FA truly cares about our patients which is very important to me.  The hardest part about my job is trying to get my patients to be complaint with their treatment and trying to get them to follow their diet.  I love everything about dialysis!  It's a pleasure to see the patient incline in their care.  I love hands on patient care!
good,"Good work enviornment, teammates get along, good team work. Hardest part of the job is when turnover starts but other wise job is manageable. Most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships built the patients. Management however is a little bit shady."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,I respect to values of the company. I have a close relative who has been a dialysis patient for four years and I can respectfully say from company to patient the core values are met appropriately. I enjoy my patients and I'm honored for the experience.
good,"A typical day at work is fast-paced and very productive. An average day consists of about approximately 15-20 calls, 20 emails, 7 voice messages, and 18 pieces of correspondence per day to answer and reply. And for every piece I answer and/or reply, I update various spreadsheets recording my transactions. Emphasis is on the turnaround time for the various requests, 24 hours to respond to a voice message or phone call, and 48 hours for emails and correspondence. What I learned is to never assume teamwork is always guaranteed and that you always ask questions, even when you understand. I worked under some wonderful excellent supervisors and managers. They really knew how to get those who work under them to understand and to do what it takes to get it done. My current supervisor left the company just a while ago and a new supervisor has taken over for the past few weeks - update to come. I work with some wonderful co-workers...just absolutely wonderful. The hardest part of my job is now trying to keep up with all the changes that has taken place since the new supervisor arrived. She has implimented many new procedures for us to follow. Change is always good and I've been keeping up with them. In addition, I really get into my job and it is fast-paced, it does make the time go quickly. And I've made such good friends, let alone teammates, that my job feels fun."
good,"Great company to work for. Moved up the ladder of the company to the position of Facility administrator, and aspired to go farther. However due to the negative impact fo an ubalanced work/life I decided to leave the company for other opportunities"
good,Opportunities for advancement. Teamwork driven. Many opportunities for continued learning . Great benefits with 401K company match up to 6%. Choice of Blue Cross and Blue Shield and Cigna Health Insurance benefits with both short and long term disability insurance.
good,"Very Focused on Insurance completed by Social Worker, instead Social Worker oriented tasks needed by patients and requested by RN or PCT's. Flex Schedule but very insurance driven so they can be reimbursed by non insurance patients. This should not be a task by the SW at all, SW spends too much time spent on that not on Social Work."
good,The clinical coordinator/head nurse was excellent. She understood the clinics needs both from the financial and clinical aspect. It was a little challenging explaining things to the facility administrator because he only knew financial side for the most part.
good,Company is good to work for but it is very hard to learn at the pace they set. I had personal family issues that made this too difficult for me. I would recommend this company for someone else though
good,This facility focuses mainly on their patients health. Everyone there truly cares about eahother. They always use proper use of equipment to emsure the safety of ever patient
good,Just acquired by a larger conglomerate who is dismantling the culture one brick at a time. Bonus structure and benefits are nonexistent or overpriced. Keeps cutting staff positions to eliminate redundancy but then assigns this jobs to employees in other positions with no additional compensation.
good,"Working at Davita is fun, and there are many opportunity’s for advancement. The only down fall is that the management sometimes are not very friendly."
good,"When I was hired back in 2012 I felt like it was the greatest company ever, however in the recent years changes to the culture and management have affected the morale. There has been several lay offs (over 100) in less than 2 years and that is a bit concerning. Management has favoritism and there is no sense of team and they proclaim. The company has good benefits and great people, however could definitely improve processes."
good,"a typical day at work starts at 5am. sometimes it's a 10,12 or 14 hour shift. It's a fun place to work for. Nurses and techs are very caring to patients. No drama."
good,As a social worker just keeping up with all the document and step that are needed when assessing patients. Because of the fast pace there are not enough hours in a day to get everything done.
good,"This is a large, busy facility.  It was a great place to learn dialysis and how to multiple task.  The team was a lot of fun.  The shifts were long but they worked around everyone's schedules."
good,"Management was extraordinary, the work itself is very quick paced and is stressful at times. Unfortunately, the people working there are unreliable and the clinic is always short and no disciplinary action is ever taken upon those who call in often."
good,A bit cramped but the people are nice. The team player stuff is kind of annoying. Overall though if you do your job and stay out of office politics thing will go nicely for you
good,Productive and Fun workplace but poor management but love caring for the patient. They offer continue learning and will send you off to Learn more. Very good benefits.
good,I did an externship at Da Vita. My views are going to be different then others. They do a great job at training their employees and do a lot to promote an upbeat atmosphere. However as an extern I felt left alone and when big project came up that needed to be done in a timely manor I felt the explanation was minimal and there was always a crunch time that really added to the stress. To me it felt like they waited to the end of the month for some thing that could have been done sooner.
good,Antelope clinic was an amazing clinic to work at for the first 2 years I worked there. Management changed and things started to go down hill. Shifts were supposed to only be 3 days 12 hours. Due to short staffed the shifts were 5-6 days 14-15 hours. Also very dangerous for our patients. Policy says 4 patients to 1 technician and it was 6 to 1. If state was to come in to do a audit the clinic would be closed. The management had little knowledge of kidney failure and dialysis which made understanding our concerns and needs difficult. I loved my job at one point in time and it was heartbreaking to leave my patients.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"I love the fact that you have every Sundays off, some major holidays off, you get to know your patients well, work 3 days with 4 off, no on calls if doing hemodialysis, opportunities to grow and tuition reimbursement. The only thing I don't like is the long hours, crazy turnovers, staff turnover is crazy, too much work for little pay and no more bonuses for us."
good,"The work place culture at DaVita is extremely fast paced, competitive/driven, multitasked, intuitive, productive and all to ensure quality service excellence each and every treatment for all patients. Both management and staff are in tune with providing quality care to our patients and an enjoyable and ethical place to work for the employees. The most rewarding part of my job is knowing that every day I help to give life to a patient and the fact that I have a very supportive group of teammates at all times. The worst part of my is witnessing a patient pass away in the clinic...It is terrible."
good,"Supervisory work at DaVita Rx is challenging, but can be rewarding. Supervisors tend to not only supervise the team from day to day, but also function in capacity as a project manager as well. The culture is very unique at DaVita Rx and you can see the way senior leadership cares about the patients. Although the job is challenging and rewarding, work-life balance can tend to suffer."
good,"I've been with the company a little over two and a half years and love it! Starting there just weeks after my high school graduation, DaVita has been the foundation of my career development. From improving my time management skills to handling/dealing with workplace conflicts and overall understanding professionalism, I like to believe I've become more mature on a professional level."
good,Great learning experience gained a tremendous amount of knowledge  in the medical field of Renal. I communicate with hospital officials and renal in-patients.
good,"I was asked by a patient if I could let him know at what temperature was his machine set up , and I replied to him, by letting him know that I'm new to clinic at this time I dont no the answer but let me go ahead and get some with more experience that could give you the right info give me a second"
good,I really enjoyed my job as the Inventory Technician at the dialysis clinic.  I was sad to be let go due to budget cuts. The staff was a a lot of fun to work with.
good,"great people, fast paced env., great hours and work/life balance. coworkers are great. not bad at all. most enjoyable part is working together with the patints and team to achieve a goal."
good,"The most rewarding part of my job is the close interaction I get to have with my patients. My manager is a wonderful person, she really cares about her staff and the patients.  The health care team is very close and works very well together to achieve the best goals for the patients. The hardest part of the job is when patients expire.  You become very close to the patients so each time one expires it's like loosing a family member."
good,"Chart reviews schedules, CUI reviews, case management of 130 patients. corrodinating  patient care with doctors and patients , monitoring labs reviewing orders"
good,"I enjoyed working one on one with the patients, and enjoyed educating patients to home dialysis treatments. I enjoy patient care and assisting patients with their healthcare needs. Unfortunately my nursing co-workers nor did the administrator,  have the same passion for patient care as I did. Changes were implemented in the workplace, and unfortunately the patients and their care were greatly affected. Patients began to make formal complaints without avail to management."
good,Working as A pct for davita can be very challanging. I feel it take a strong person do work in the healhcare field its self. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that Im helping someone through another day of life. I have learned alot through my experience of being apart of the dialysis world and hope to conitnue to learn more. The harderst part of my job is getting attached to patients and seeing them go away. Again the job could be challenging but i love it.
good,This company is great in a whole but the hours suck and the company leadership at each branch does not care if you have kids and need to go get them from school. Great Company horrible hours
good,Long productive days where teamwork is a must. I learned to listen to my patients and treat them as an individual. Management could communicate more effectively. Knowing that patients were safe under my care is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Patient care - dialysis ...Daily taking care of payroll, incoming calls, ordering and stocking of all medical stock needed for patient care.  Processing all paperwork for new patients and patients who are transferring to other clinics, travel arrangements, filing, keeping all paperwork in patients charts up to date.  Speaking with doctors offices, hospitals, admissions.   Co-workers are a great team to work with they are like family!  I've learned to be a team player and also to be self reliant - efficient in my work.    Enjoyable part of my job is having a sense of accomplishment when I leave at the end of the day knowing that I leave things in order and if someone else has to step in they should be able to pick right up where I left off."
good,"They use Excel to run their budget process...they do have a culture they are proud of and promote enthusiastically, but that's not something I really care about. They also have good work-life balance for non-managers, but I saw my managers working ridiculous hours and getting run ragged by the executives. Why work in a place where you get to look forward to a promotion and the end of your family life."
good,"A typical day at DaVita is scheduled around time .... what time the patients treatment starts, when it ends ... when your next patient is ready to start their treatment ... passing medications ... hanging IV antibiotics.  Dialysis is a clinical setting just simply not in the hospital, it's out-patient.  My Co-Workers are some of the most dedicated group of Nurses I've ever had the privilege to work with and the Management will support you 110%."
good,"Solid company, average pay but committed to their culture."
good,I learned the essentials to medical billing and all that it consist of.
good,"5am till 5pm work day, sometimes later..it depends."
good,FA stood behind you
good,"Good environment, fast paced, have compassion."
good,Everything that I know about dialysis I learned from my co workers at DaVita. I don't think that they have the best training program but the employees that work there are more informative than any class.
good,"Life as a DaVita Social Worker will often be very fast paced, and a lot of duties required of the social workers should be delegated to office staff but don't waste your breath beating this drum..no one will hear you. Unfortunately, Social Workers are not valued nearly as much as other professional staff...and it's not hidden. The pay is good, the patients are great and the majority of your ""team mates"" will become life long friends...this I promise you. Overall I would say I truly enjoyed the vast majority of my 8 years with DaVita, but when it's time to go...GO!"
good,"I loved the job, but I transferred to a new location, and they did not want to work with my schedule. I have to have a stable schedule due to the fact that I have children. I have to get help from family and friends with my children, and they have lives too. Management did not want to work with my schedule."
good,"For a young person DaVita is Great, but if you are needing GREAT benefits, such as 401(k) Match, and PAID Holidays this is not the place.  LOVE My boss, but need better benefits."
good,"Opportunity to advance your nursing carrrer with tuition reimbursement "
good,"Senior staff were very cold and non-supportive.  heavy workloads,  long hours on your feet, but patients were usually very appreciative of the care given"
good,The day started at 5 in the morning. Patients started arriving at 6 in the morning to be assessed and begin the process prior to receiving their dialysis treatment.
good,"In the Administration role in DaVita there are a lot of things you are responsible for. Everything under the clinic roof, including the roof, is the Facility Administrators responsibility. This includes the RN's, LPN's, PCT's, Dietician, Social Worker, budgets, ordering, facility clinical values, PDR's, staffing, passing Medicare surveys, patient satisfaction, teammate satisfaction and much more. "
good,"Acute dialysis was always busy so you always got your hours. Self paced, however you never knew what time you were leaving. Overall good company, love team concept. Fun place to work."
good,"Biomedical technician is hands on and you need to be able to learn fast.  Must be able to retain and apply a lot of information.  majority of the people are very happy and easy going to work with, but others can be two-faced and will try to run over you."
good,"Was a very fast paced job. I enjoyed the patients daily during their treatments. Set up dialyzers for each patient, cannulate each patient in a timely manner. Keep on track and do not fall behind so paying attention to detail is crucial. on my feet a lot."
good,Productive workplace.Hectic work hours. Excellent benefit package.Friendly work environment. Lovable clients.If one had a set schedule overall acceptable place to work.
good,"Geriatric unit of lovable elderly patient's. Increased patient load. Much experience with medication administration. Experience with patient's with trachs, G-tubes and wound care. Enjoyable part of job is being a part of patient's rehabilitation to allow them to live independently and maintain their autonomy."
good,"good place to work, the benefits were fantastic.  The problem with any large corporation is that the higher up people lose touch with the people that make the company.  Management should have a necessary management class certification of completion, regarding the political correctness of said position, how to deal with and conduct business in a professional manner."
good,"DaVita truly believed in the company's Core Values when it came to their teammates (employees)"
good,"I tend to never do the same tasks on a daily basis, which makes my job very interesting. My company truly cares for the quality of care for their patients. "
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"A typical day consisted of setting up and breaking down dialysis machines and making sure the patients were comfortable during their treatment. I would work 12-15 hrs for 5 to 6 days straight, leaving very little time to sleep. The managers played favoritism to the older staff. I did enjoy my time getting to know the patients and some of the co-workers were fun to be around too."
good,"great medical expirience, learned to multitask, long hours, little respect to co-workers, favortism to certain coworkers"
good,"We were acquired by davita in jan 2012. the takeover was not very smooth, but we all tried to overlook that. My time here is a great experiance, with the exception of one individual, who making it very difficult to continue working there."
good,"The clinic that I work at has a manager with great conflict resolution skills. Other clinics that I have been to, not so much. I am happy with my pay, the managers do their best to accommodate personal schedules. The culture that they try to promote is that everyone works together as a team and I really like that. The hardest part for me is that interoffice communication is not the best so when patients come in expecting on thing and then get told another, the front desk is left to diffuse the situation. All companies have their quirks, but overall, this is one of my favorite places to have worked."
good,Love working for DaVita  Highly recommend to friends.  Great Village to be apart of.  I have been truly blessed by being a Davita teammate these past 10 years
good,"As a Facility Administrator, there was absolutely no end/rest.  The position requires diplomacy, vigilance, supervision, dedication, and a tireless ability to observe functionality.  It is often a thankless job."
good,"Great place to work, coworkers are nice, nice building. The hardest part about the job is the fast pace and patients. Management could be a little more organized."
good,"This organization makes efforts to provide the best for employees and patients alike however, remains subject to the realities of the Healthcare Environment-ie, insurance and business environment, regulatory changes..."
good,There were two months of training on the computer.  I had no dedicated preceptor and had no one to follow to complete my training.  I was left on my on to run the program without adequate training.  I found later that the same happened to other nurses.  This is a major problem and they have a high attrition rate as well as low pay.
good,"Davita has some great policies and ideas, however, the workload and hours are less than desirable. I work anywhere from 14-17 hour shifts and see 36 patients a day in a very fast paced environment. I am the only nurse on the floor and am often pulled in many different directions at once while caring for 12 patients at a time with 3 PCT's under my direction. We are often understaffed and overworked d/t this fast paced environment. I don't feel that I'm able to give 100% to my patients at this job and have felt my license is in danger at times."
good,I was so overwhelmed and satisfied overall on how this company treated their employees.  Davita is not just a company but a way of life.  However some Management level employees ( teammates ) did not show diversity.   Quick to judge and they do not respect ones faith in Christ ( Biblical ).  Sadly a medical condition forced me to perform below standard and I was let go. I am not bitter one bit.  I pray ans wish the best for all of them who interacted with even though my Manager did not even speak a word to me during my exit interview. I was never given a chance to speak.  Fellow teammates in the payroll Service Center were very negative about other team mates in the building and abroad.  Poor Morale. Attitude did reflect direct leadership.
good,Great culture and engaging responsibilities. Ample opportunities for growth and advancement. There tends to be a discrepancy between culture and values in the field operations versus what is preached at corporate
good,DaVita cares deeply about their patients and employees. All employees worked well together to keep patients happy and everyone enjoyed being at work.
good,Great benefits and compensation. Management a little shaky and needs some tweaking.
good,Personalities are strong: to take the direction and pressures of end of life issues.  Compensation is generous and the company is always striving to glean ideas for improvement.
good,"My position required me to manage the biomedical and facility upkeep side of multiple clinics, perform a monthly disinfection on the dialysis machines, as well as the water purification systems."
good,"very intense environment to work in , the techs have zero respect for co-workers personal space come off very hostile and unprofessional the techs are aggressive and unpleasant ,"
good,"I started work at 4am and the first thing I did was check the water treatment system and mix the dialysis bicarb solution. I started all machines, strung the lines and removed air from the system. When patients arrived I would take their vitals and connected them to the machine by cannulating their access site. I then monitored the patients vitals and recorded all the info into a bed side computer. When the treatment was over I would pull their needles and bandage the sites, weigh the patient to assure they recived adequate dialysis and I cleaned their station. Then I would prepare the station for the next patient. I was responsible for four patients per shift and there were two shift of patients per day during my 12hr day. I learned something new about kidneys and dialysis everyday. My facility administrator was amazing, some of the co-workers were the gossiping type but most of them were pleasant to work with. They were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was time management but I absolutely loved working with the patients and knowing I was making a difference in their lives. It was a very rewarding career."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"great hours , great pay , great benefits just dont ever make the staff mad you will be forever not in the ""club anymore"" and be an outcast."
good,"Sadly this company cared more about profits and keeping its employees in line that it fired or ""let go"" of many good quality workers if not lost them to lower paying jobs."
good,"Very nice to be able to work here on my schedule, but limited work available as it was only one affiliate site versus access to many sites that needed out patient consultant RPh wrk."
good,"Nephrology nursing is a specialty and you definitely learn a lot!!  I have some pretty good coworkers and most of us have developed outside friendships as a result.  My facility administrator pretends or tries to be friendly but I don't think she knows how.  If you don't like to be on your feet for a long time, hate 12hr shifts, don't like blood, cannot work with blocks of very fast-pace, cannot think on your feet: chronic hemodialysis is not for you. Davita seems like a decent company.  It is doing well financially so it seems the pay could be better or they could do 401k match.  The one thing I really don't like is they're always trying to roll out new initiatives/doing away with something without finding a better alternative. The staff turnover is quite high in some clinics but the longevity here is pretty good and I think it is related to the strong leadership/good working relationship with the MDs."
good,Team mates come to work prepared to put in a full days work. I've learned the fundamentals regarding dialysis and how it works to sustain those who have been diagnosed with end stage renal disease. Management is fair and easy to communicate with. Team mates all work together to make the day go smoothly.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get the patients to comply with their treatment. The most enjoyable is when they do.
good,"The management is weak, they don’t seem to appreciate employees as much as they appreciate their pockets. Always looking into how to cut cost and what patients really need. They train staff to loose as soon as they trained. Work retention is very poor."
good,"Productive, fun workplace. Great company"
good,"At face value DaVita seems like it would be a great place to work and they go a long way to frame it as such. The reason for this? DaVita's business model isn't sustainable, they lose money on every Medicare/caid patients, more than 80% of their market and growing. As such, they have to funnel people to private plans to try to make up the difference and squeeze their ""Teammates"" in clever ways and use the ""DaVIta Way"" to appeal to people's emotional vs rational side."
good,"The middle and upper management are nothing like the executive team members...  They need to do more 360 reviews on those people."
good,"This unit has a compassionate team, that works well together.  Excellent patient focus, and engagement. "
good,"One of my favorite things about the job was being with the patient from start to finish of their dialysis treatment. From greeting, to starting IV's and monitoring them through their treatment ensuring they were stable, comfortable and safe to ending the treatment and walking them out. "
good,"Very fast paced and busy, a lot of changes in management lately, very stressful some days and hard on the older workers, bending over and on their feet for long periods of time. Everyone if very friendly that works there. I enjoy what I do and love the patients and staff, but I'm ready for a change and with normal hours."
good,"A typical day at work starts at either 4:00am or 4:30am and goes until about 9:30pm, sometimes later. Sometimes people show up at  6:00am and stay until 10:15pm or so. And sometimes people show up at 4:30am and leave at 5:00 or 6:00pm, but these are the exceptions, not the rule. Often employees work until 9:30 or 10:00pm and then have to be back again the next morning at 4:30am. The management has promised specific salaries or raises and then has not given them out. For the amount of training to learn the job, the amount of hours worked, and the amount of stress involved, it's just not worth it to work for DaVita."
good,"Our unit was acquired by Davita one year ago. Staffing at all levels were insufficient for an acquisition, resulting in a lot of frustration and worked hours."
good,Village approach patient centered care where all patients and staff are encouraged to interact as a village.
good,"I enjoyed my work and my patients. Co worker for the most part were ok, Manager staff had no idea what they were doing making employee schedules, have no compassion for there employees or the hours they work from 4:30 am till 9 to 10pm"
good,Some days were very stressful it was plenty of call offs and not enough coverage to cover the shifts. The hardest part of the job was getting great people to actually work. The most enjoyable part of the job in my opinion was taking care of my patients.
good,"I learned a great deal at DaVita, I love working as a team. Every day is something new and brings new challenges. Hardest part of the job is the company doesn't seem to have loyalty to tenured teammates"
good,"I just wanted to have professional advancement for my nursing career,to learn new knowledge,that can be beneficial to both me and my patients as well."
good,"It is a fast paced environment, which makes you loose track of time and before you know it, it is time to go home. Co-workers were nice but lack in teamwork. The training is not focused, without notice they will expect you to perform as an employee who has been there for 2 years or more. Management is never seen nor accessible."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Great co-workers but Don't expect to work desirable shifts and there is not much room for advancement within DCR. Low stress is a great benefit.......
good,Such a sad place to work. If you are weak in stomach this isn't for u. Lots of blood. Lots of urine and fecal matter. You become attached to the patients and then they die.
good,A typical day starts at 5am getting patients on the machine for treatment by 6am. We put on and manage three patients at a time for up to 4 hours per patient. we average 9 patients per tech per day. Working here taught me all about the dialysis  process and more about renal failure. since I have worked here ( roughly a year) we have had several managerial changes which we have worked diligently to overcome. we have a very diverse work staff that all try our best to give our patients the best treatment and care possible. the hardest part of my job has been the long work hours which make it difficult to spend time with my family. what I love most about my job is my patients. they make my days better and I would like to think I make theirs better as well.
good,"The starting pay is NOT good enough. Each clinic has its own personality. If you find a clinic where you measure really well with your coworkers, and  they have good work ethic, its a great place to work. In some clinics, the can  be hard to work with   when you are working with patients and a coworker undermines you in front of them, it can be an unnecessary battle at work."
good,The original clinic I worked at was great. The teammates worked together for the most part. The second clinic I worked at was horrible. The teammates would only work and help the teammates that was there when I got there. The fa wouldn't even talk to me when she seen me. I broke my arm and filed FMLA she cut my hours and told the entire staff I was low man on the totem pole. S
good,The Saluti administrators did not do their job correctly. They wanted to blame everyone else that didn’t do their job. Working as a patient care Tech was awesome for the first 15 years. What’s becoming a nurse I loved it the doctors love me the facility minutes trader put a dent in all that
good,No work/life balance unless you were a director level or above.  Staff was insanely overworked due to high turnover rates because everyone...EVERYONE is underpaid.
good,"II am not able to provide an opinion about the typical work day, what I have learned, the management , workplace culture, the hardest part of the job or the most enjoyable part of the job at this time."
good,"Fast-paced environment with many opportunities for learning. Pay scale is average. Facilities are either very nice (Town & Country) or very poor conditions (Hazelwood). Poor work culture among staff. This job was did not provide a good work/life balance since your 10 hour day can easily turn into a 16-hour day due to machine complications, late arriving patients, or over scheduling, or consistently being short staffed."
good,"High turnover with low morale among team members. Changes in management during time of employment created some confusion."
good,"Loved working at this company I worked in many of the clinics in the Region, however the last four months were miserable as I was working for an FA that was very did not respect my professional and clinical decisions.  I was terminated unfairly as this FA had the power to destroy my livelihood.  I enjoyed the work culture and what the company stood for however the company needs to find more qualified professionals to be assigned to the position of FA (Facility Administrator), this is a very powerful position and if the wrong person is allowed to be lead this is a living nightmare for the whole clinic.  Loved the patients and everything else, like co-workers."
good,Great company to work for depending on management and specific clinic you work at. Expect long work days with a stressful environment at times. For the most part the patient to employee ratio law is followed but occasionally short staffed. Pay could be better but it’s decent for a job without a degree.
good,"I enjoy helping people, and loved the people and patients there.  How ever the work/life balance kept tipping and then pt. care was suffering as well, I didn't want to liable for the inevitable out come with having only 2 employees with 8 patients on the machines."
good,"Working at DaVita was an adventure 😒. The PCT’s stay but not the RN’s. There is always power struggle between PCT’s and RN’s.  The pay is mediocre, and the hours are horrible. The work environment is very fast paced and stressful.The facility administrators don’t care about anything but numbers."
good,Acute dialysis RN position in very stressful. Long hours with call. This job is definitely for a single person with no kids. There is definitely money to be made if yo can take the stress and varied hours. The benefits are good with matching 401k and stock options and medical HSA account.
good,"I am a very private person, will only discuss previous employers face to face."
good,"Worked here for seven years,There's a lot of advancement that we can be do, tuition reimbursement, companywide skills, trips etc.! I was very excited to work here in the beginning."
good,The goals set by corporate were unrealistic and unacceptable attainable. I learn how to think outside the box to accomplish a goal and attain real team work.The hardest part of the job was redirecting the staff to do the right thing all the time.
good,"2 strikes and you are out, don't really protect their staff.  More on patient and reimbursements private insurance (  Profit driven), Backstabbers coming from Nurses and other staff (politics)"
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Davita is a dialysis company located in Berwyn, Pa. This company maintain the life support of many patients through out the country. Their financial revenue is generated through the patients insurance providers. I enjoyed assuring patients coverage to allow them the life support in which they needed. The close nit environment of the personnel that I work with and around was great. The hardest part of the job was informing someone they were not covered for various procedure in which they needed, but yet I tried to help as much as possible."
good,"Typical Day at work would be fast paced and always switching from one task to another. I learned multi tasking as well as time management. Teammates were always friendly and very helpful. Management was extremely busy so we worked with our fellow teammates when there was an issue or a question. Hardest part of the job was working on the retro authorizations for medical groups in California. Most enjoyable part of the job was the fun activities that we did as a team, Easter egg hunts and cube decorations."
good,I just don't feel like they are really patient and teammate oriented anymore. As time  changes so has the company. Of course change is to be expected but we must keep what's important priority.
good,"I have worked in 2 different regions, they were like day and night. One employee friendly the other Politically driven by popularity. Good to work for"
good,I absolutely love my job but struggle with the constant change and the fact that they dont pay enough for how much work you do. Its very high paced and stressful at times.
good,"Loved my position, was still learning new things pertaining to my position. New management came in and after 2 weeks I was told I was being let go for job performance. Felt this was Very unfair due too the time frame new manager gave me too know my job performance or my job responsibilities."
good,"I typical day at work consisted off providing patient education. I worked with management to provide treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease. The workplace culture allowed me opportunities to collaborate with the doctors, nurses, dieticians and social workers to establish a patient’s plan of care. The hardest part of my job was dealing with patients who did not follow health protocols. The most enjoyable part was the community that we built."
good,Facility Administrator was reason for leaving.  Management did not seem to care and expected more than going above and beyond.  Patients were appreciative of social work.
good,"I probably would have still been here, if the company hadn't been closing laying me off. The company as a whole was a good company to work for, I loved the culture and really loved the family culture it had. I'm very sad that the company is closing. It worked well with my family life."
good,"DaVita is a highly competitive place to work. The company has a very familiar feel to it. However it is almost impossible for someone to be fired from this company. Even if they put the lives of the patients and fellow teammates in danger. They are always given a second, third and even fourth chance. Because of this the good employees get fed up and leave and the not so good employees are left to run the clinics. It is hard to bring new employees in to this environment. There is so much negativity and talking about teammates behind their backs that is makes it a stressful clinic. No one wants to work in an environment where they think they are always being micromanaged and where some one is always out to get them in trouble."
good,"Working for DaVita was a great opportunity, everything I learned was from working there. I came in not knowing anything about Dialysis. The patients were great, made my job easy and the patients being so calm made me at ease. wonderful experience. Nerve racking job, people lives are in your hands. They are so under paid, they job that PCT's do definitely deserves a pay raise."
good,Days are extremely long because of hours and pay isn't good at all. The management team isnt the best but things can be taken to a higher archy. Great benefits
good,"The patients were amazing but it is very difficult to balance a work life with family life."
good,The work day is typically fast-paced. I have learned how to critically assess patients before and during dialysis. I have learned how to maintain patient's lives during emergency situations. The management attempts to include the team with decision-making and genuinely cares for the employees. The workplace culture changes with location. The hardest part of the job is to see a patient pass while waiting for a transplant. The most rewarding part of the job  is having patients understand how to manage their diagnosis because of the nurse's proper education and be apart of their treatment.
good,Davita is a fast paced competitive environment.  I was able to lead very large complex projects and travel quite a bit.  The work was interesting but there was no work life balance.
good,"I love working with patients and enjoy Teammates, depending on the facility, you have your favorites. This job is not for everyone, but may work out as a stepping stone to find where you feel more comfortable at in the dialysis setting. Advancements are there but extremely hard to advance unless you are a certain person. LIVE EAT AND BREATHE the company and you will go much further."
good,The work environment pace is fast due to fast turnover of patients everyday.Some have only  2 hours treatment time and you have to prepare for the next incoming patient.
good,"12 hour shifts, fast paced environment, multiple patients, close patient interaction which is the most enjoyable part of the job. What I learned about my experience in Davita, is learning and expanding my knowledge on how the kidney works, and how the dialysis machines keep patients going."
good,High turnover d/t management.  There is no life out side of work.  Management turns over nurses like bad kids on a dads lap.  $$ comes first-then patients-then employees.  Upper management makes decisions on what happens on the clinical floor while they sit in their office eating mcdonalds and doughnuts.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Upscale and fun place. Management is really professional. Teammates are always happy and thankful to be there. I have received awards and certifications with the company. The hardest part are the patines. Which most don't want to be there.
good,DaVita is a fun place to work. It tries to balance the work load among its employees so that not everyone is overworked.  They enjoy doing company team building exercises away from the office to give their employees a little break a couple times a year.  The work load is heavy and must be accurate.
good,"DaVita provides a great opportunity to learn team work skills. Management could improve."
good,"great job, good co-workers, workload nice."
good,"Fast pace job, early hours, management flaws because of frequent changes, but overall great company with opportunity for overtime and lots of locations."
good,"A reuse tech has flexible hours.  Typically, the benefits are great, full health, dental, vision, life, etc.  No matching 401k. As far as advancement goes, good luck moving past the menial labor positions.  Coworkers are typically very pleasant.  Management is typically very confused and not sure what is going on a lot of times."
good,"Great place to work and grow, this is a culture driven organization with emphasis on the core values. Metrics are very important but not too overwhelming. Solid core leadership as well as a knack for getting tasks completed."
good,Davita is a great national Co. to work for. I've learned a lot in my now 5 yrs with them. I've met some great people in the process.
good,"Davita is a good company to work for. Overall, happy with my time with this company. Enjoyed my coworkers and peers. Work Life Balance was not good."
good,lack of nurturing for growth and advancement. poor mix of life/work balance. working long numerous hours filling in for teammates.
good,Excellent company for anyone looking for a family oriented workplace.
good,"Reviewed claims prior to billing to ensure claims contained applicable modifiers and ICD codes.  Worked closely with Physicians and Dialysis Centers to verify accuracy and required signature forms are on file.  Submitted claims to insurance plans for payment.  "
good,I code Hospital Documentation that is sent to our Medical Records department. I Audit any where from 7 to 10 Clinics every month. I attend Leadership meetings. My team is very pleasent to work with. I love doing my Audits. We are dual coding in ICD 9 and ICD 10.
good,"Company has experienced tremendous growth,not much room for advancement"
good,Very pleasant working environment.  Team is engaged.  Management minimal transparency.  Hardest part of job is traveling too much and too many meetings.  Most enjoyable part is helping patients and caring for them and their families.
good,I perform acute dialysis for acutely ill pts. in the hospital setting. I cover several hospitals in the area. You really never know how busy you are going to be from day to day. There is really no way to determine this. It is just the way acute dialysis is.
good,"I truly believe in this company's values and how it treats its employees, in general.  However, I was hired on a team that lacked management for 2 mos.  So it was a big disorganized and still in transition at the moment."
good,"Some state that DaVita promotes climbing the ladder, I beg to differ. I have a bachelors in business management and summing up an MBA and seem to not be notice in this company. Management applaudes me on my current performance, however, continues to over look me. I have watched new nursing graduates become employees of DaVita and lack the knowledge to be a leader, however, within months they are promoted to being a supervisor of a facility. I have stated my concern to the DVP, ROD, and GFA (middle managment)and the issue continues to be pushed to the side. My days with this company is number due to their lack of communication and recognition of an overachieving employee."
good,You learn a lot and keep on learning after training. Help you get in to college and have some financial aid. There is PTO available to accumulat weekly. Everyone gets short term disability.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"I really had awesome experience here. People are so supportive, many new things to learn all the time. Never get pressurized for work. Best place to work"
good,"was the greatest job I ever had and was extreamly happy... until I ""twisted"" my ankle at home and had to go on short term disability, wound up having to receive ankle reconstruction and really was never able to restart my job.  That really sucked"
good,"Good people, but the culture isn't for everyone.  Very strong team dynamic that can be strong at times.  If you are a loner or glory seeker, this isn't the place for you."
good,"i really enjoyed working for DAVITA"
good,Good company until I wanted advancement. I applied for many management positions over the course of 8 years and never was given the opportunity even though I was qualified. If you were an outstanding tech they kept you on the floor. Very few were ever given opportunities to advance. When it came to having my side through some huge changes within my clinic DaVita stepped aside and regardless of the fact the then manager was wrong and fired for it I wasn’t backed.
good,The pay is pretty good and they have room for advancement. They will reimburse you for tuition if you decide to go back to school to be a nurse. The hours are either really long or very short there is no balance. Also the benefits aren’t really good.
good,They mean well...with so many locations and high turnover recruiting is a challenge.  Near zero percent unemployment in nursing but they ding you push blame on recruiting every time someone you hire leaves.
good,The culture was important here and they offered many opportunities to develop and improve leadership skills.  They strived to provide leaders and mentors who developed you as a person.
good,"Highly stressful and competitive organization.  Overall, they do care about patient care and safety.  Not for the weak at heart.  Overall, I would do it again.  They give great experience and training."
good,"As with any job, it has its pros and cons. DaVita is a welcoming company that allow for growth internally and externally. My experience here was challenging at times but for the most part it has been a wonderful journey to be a part of such company."
good,"A day in DaVita will be, you clock in, tell everyone goodmorning, go to your area of where your assigned then start setting up for your patients, Check their prescriptions make sure you have their meds drawn and machine set according to the doctors orders. "
good,there is a lot of work but very rewarding. If you love your patients you will love your job. I enjoy the work but wished I was compensated better. I feel that there is not effort to give people raises when asked.
good,"This is a great place to work, if you have no other obligations and you can be flexible working all hours of the day and  night. I have held my position for five years."
good,"DaVita culture is great and a wonderful place to work, but Facility Administrator can make the job wonderful or stressful and management claims to support teammate grievances, but no changes occur."
good,Nice Corp location and building. Transportation was easily available becasue the office was nearby the train station. The environment was really chill and relax.
good,DaVita has been a wonderful place to work they have treated me well.  I am just at a point in my life to where I am looking for something different.  Working in the medical field is something I strive for everyday.
good,"Very family orientated. "
good,"You build a strong bond with your patients and their families. That's what make the job rewarding. On the other hand,  long  hard hours. You will either love dialysis or hate it."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"DaVita is a great company to start with, I worked in the business office and I worked for two positions on the same team (two parts to the team, separate floors of the office). This is a good place to start in general for a office position, there are multiple teams between each building and they all handle different aspects of the process for billing or patient regulations, medical regulations etc."
good,Overall a good company where you can learn lots and positively impact the lives of your patients.  Local management is non supportive and work days are about 15 hours long
good,"As an intern, it helped me grow and gain skills that I would not have received anywhere else. The staff were very friendly and I would highly recommend it."
good,Davita is good company to work for . It is family oriented and most people are team players. You work long hours and get a lot of free lunch and that is a plus saves you money.
good,Davita has a lot of great benefits! They are willing to new nurses which is a plus! You can advance within davita! The hardest part of the job is the hours! I have to get up at 3am to get to work on time!
good,"Davita promotes the idea of career advancement, but in reality it is little more than a metric they check in a box each year.  Very little is able to be obtained for persons outside of management or developers, in the IT area.  The culture is good, so they have that going for them, but if you want to grow your career in IT, outside of writing code or being a manager, look elsewhere."
good,"In the hospital setting, your day is very unpredictable, you may be done in 6 hours or it may take 16 hours. Call pay is poor, raises are a joke. Some physicians are difficult to work with."
good,"my co workers were great, but the management did not see things on the same level as the hourly employees. I was asked many times a week to drive across the county in rush hour traffic, and then repremanded when i didnt make it to a job site in time. Leaving was easy."
good,"Arrived at 3am to start water treatment room to prepare for all dialysis treatments performed that day. Set up equipment and program machines with individual patient settings/orders.  Responsible for 4 patients per shift and would cover 8 patients during partners breaks and meal period. Asked to do many additional roles without pay compensation or even a thank you at times.  Quarterly bonuses based on center specific goals selected by manager and regional leads, rarely do clinical staff have much control over these expectations."
good,It is a very fast paced clinic. Keeps you on your toes. Very strict and knit picky about everything. evening hours do not work well with my family life.
good,"Good culture. They make time for fun and everyone is pretty friendly. Management needs to focus on time management and setting realistic goals. They also tend to hire consultants, which creates a one-brain mentality."
good,job good it is not feeling for the job. nursing is good it helps people. why davita? why not. good place fast paced long days many hours sometimes good
good,"My typical day at work included seeing around 16-20 patients and conducting dialysis treatments, obtaining vital sings on every patient upon entering the treatment area, obtaining a detailed medical record on each patient."
good,"First I come in on first shift, I set up machines, make other jobs that may be apart of my POD is done, (Phoenix Meter, bleach water, stock, make catheter kits,machine log), Check the Machine, Keep up with vitals, Needle cannulation, Computer Data input, Draw Labs, Provide clean area, Trouble shoot machine/computer,Patient Education, Assist patient on Dialysis Machine."
good,Davita is a very customer focused company. They pride themselves in Customer Service. Management is super supportive and shows appreciation to they're employees.
good,Great company to work for.  Can be overloaded with work at times but they're working to fix this by adding additional teammates.  They promote heavily from within.
good,The workplace culture can be pretty awesome. They do things as a company wide to support their teammates. Hardest part of the job was I wasn't always busy. I had to find things to do.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"It is a good start for someone. Also, you tend to work long hours for most of the days in a week. There is always something going on and after a while it takes a toll on your body and mind."
good,Your workload as a biomedical technician can be very heavy. Training upon hiring is very little. Most is OJT. Travel can be a hassel for some. Highly advise having a good gas mileage car is best suited for this job.
good,Great but stressful workplace. Early morning and long hours. Enjoyed patient care. Poor management. But overall great company. Great benefits. Good teammates.
good,"The job was pretty easy - typical call center environment."
good,A typical workday consisted of answering phones and assisting providers with medical claims. I enjoyed the co-workers. There was not really a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of job was interacting with fellow employees.
good,"DaVita has great teammates. I worked in Lab Customer Support."
good,The place was great and so we're the people just it was difficult how they expect you to do so much in so little time. This job did make you feel like you were making a difference in people lives.
good,"Depending on the location of the clinic you work at, the people you work with can either be great or really not good. Most of the time everybody does their job. It is job security for the most part especially if you are a nurse."
good,This was a pretty good company to be employed with. I was new to Dialysis and they gave me exceptional training. The hours were not too bad and the pay was pretty decent.
good,"Working at Davita one must be on their toes, whether in the back office doing the billing, being a dietician, or a social worker or being on the clinic floor where the action really is, everyone needs to work together to keep the patients safe. Really enjoy my work here."
good,"Willingness to encourage growth and career development."
good,"I have no experience as a paid employee, only as an intern.  It is a well-run organization.  The employees are helpful, and the supervisors are kind.  I have enjoyed my internship."
good,"Set your own schedule routine usually."
good,"Good place to work, wonderful staff. Very fast paced work, makes the day go by fast. Patients can be difficult at times but being empathetic and understanding there situation is key."
good,"Good place to work, training is not so great due to certain employees. "
good,"DaVita is a great company. But overall, with small children the work/life balance wasn't great. Long hours and major adjustment if you are not a morning person"
good,"The overall company has great core values, but certain departments are not recognized and appreciated monetarily. The change in management over the years has led to an unfocused approach and this has led to a high turnover."
good,"From the moment you walk into the clinic until the moment you walk out, you're in motion, taking care of a group of patients, (3 sets of patients in most clinics), all day every day. Fun and fast paced but a wonderful company  to work for."
good,Friendly environment and great team work.  Company activity occasionally to balance work and life. Work is hard but feels good being able to help pts. and make a difference.
good,"Culture fluctuates based on which location or department you work in.  Inconsistent leadership. The company is extremely results driven! Slow to move out poor performers."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"fortune 500 company, advancement opportunity, patient centered care, team work, employee recognition, centered around core values, continuous quality improvement"
good,"The hardest part of the job is getting your renal patients to adhere to the recommended diet so you are constantly trying to create new ways so your teaching is appealing to your patients. "
good,It's a good place to work. The hours are challenging due to starting so early in the morning. The benefits are good. The clinic that I work in has great teamwork and is a very fun environment.
good,"Davita Pittsburgh Acute Program is a busy/challenging environment to work in. Many late 'add on' treatments, many CRRT treatments to start,restart,or trouble shoot. Most recent management(Facility Administrator) is difficult to work with, poor social skills. Past FAs' created a very comfortable, congenial environment where open discussion, critique, as well as praise was part of our teams culture."
good,"Patients are the first priority in any medical setting. Patients come in 3 days a week on average usually treatments last around 3-5 hours per day. Patients sometimes become ill during their treatments, their blood pressure can drop, they can spike a fever and sometimes feel completely run down by the time they leave. I learned how to accurately start a dialysis treatment, the management was just okay at this location. Some of the co-workers are immature, but most were out for patient care. The hardest part of my job was the fast pace when I first started, you are given a new patient to start treatment on every 15 minutes at the start of each shift, which means you must acquire all of their vitals and start their treatments, and input their data into the computer during each vital check. The most enjoyable part of my job were my patients."
good,Great Company to work for. Davita offers competitive benefits package. All necessary training for State required certifications are provided by Davita.
good,Not a place where hard work is valued. More of who you know rather than what you know. People make the difference. No 401k match or cost of living increase.
good,I really liked working here until I was told my position was being eliminated. Management was sneaky about it and was not transparent about it which disappointed me.
good,Good company to work for. I think they need to have clinics managed by RN. Advancement opportunities are present but usually requires traveling. Insurance is given and vacation time is given.  Overall is a good company to work at.
good,DaVita has a unique culture and was a challenging and enjoyable place to work. My colleagues were very intelligent and enjoyable to work with.
good,"Union job, good hours, great staff!  Willing to work with you for schedule changes.  Be sure to know all of the union rules if you plan to transfer to a specialty.  You may not be able to go back to where you were if you don't like it"
good,"Patients have been great, very understanding and supportive with new staff.Can be a hostile environment due to coworkers, some are helpful, some of the PCT and nurses mistreat the patients, the facility administrator is manipulative and hardly there for help or support constantly ill"
good,"Typical workday changed from 10 hours per day to 14/15 hours per day. Learned a lot of interpersonal skills, both with team members and patients. Management skills developed. Hardest part was the long hours. Most enjoyable part of job was developing relationships with the clients."
good,"Typical day involved conference calls, daily/monthly reports, continuous education, monthly presentations, one-on-one patient interaction on a daily basis, etc."
good,This is a great place to get your feet wet in leading people and personal growth. Not a lot of development opportunities for development after Supervisor Role. Be prepared to deal with an ever changing environment
good,"Fast paced and physically demanding job.  A pleasure, getting to know all of the patients.  Little variation in daily job tasks."
good,"- Culture is unique"
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"A typical day at work is always fun because my co-workers are fun and energetic people. We value our Core Values: Service Excellence, Integrity, Fun Team Fulfillment, Continuous Improvement, and Accountability. We adore our career and most of all we Give Life. "
good,"Davita has a great working environment. That is because of how supportive fellow teammates are. However, that being said it is not easy to advance in Davita. It seems as if you have a great outgoing personality (that not everyone has) and a great worker you get advanced. If you don't have the bubbly cheerleading personality but are AWESOME at your job, you don't get advanced. I personally think that the work should be the most important aspect of an employee and they should be so lucky to have such hard and dedicated workers."
good,I liked the work environment and learned a great deal about kidney disease from the physicians. The work was satisfying and I got to meet so good people. The hardest part of the job was the work volume however it was satisfying to be a part of the team that gave excellent patient care.
good,Davita is great and good to the teammates and also the work/life balance.  They treat their teammates great.  I need to work closer to my home
good,"Typically, any workday at a DaVita clinic can be a roller-coaster ride dealing with patients and teammates especially during the change of shifts.  It is up to you not to be sick once you get off the ride."
good,Typical day at work is assessing continuously 28 to 36 pts and administering meds to those pts.  Supervising pt care techs and
good,Interning there was a great experience. The staff works hard and takes their jobs very seriously. The patients were all great to work with aswell.
good,"Reason for leaving was that as the Charge Nurse my hours were changed on a week to week basis or, occasionally on a day to day basis."
good,The frontline teammates are hard working patient loving people. I do think the supervisors need to be trained to do what they ask their front line teammates. The front line teammates will do their very best to make sure the patient are happy with the services provided. It was a great company to work for.
good,"Working at DaVita was like working with family. Everyone cared about each other, we may not have always gotten along, but what family does always get along. The sense of team work there was like none other that I have experienced thus far."
good,"Davita is a nice place to work. The hours are crazy and long.  You must be flexible.  You have to work on the holidays and weekends.  They have a lot of good perks such as discounts on car insurance, amusement tickets, etc."
good,"Leading team, identify clinical operations, review staffing, budget goals, delegation, initiatives, education. Cons of the position are the constant micromanagement and the changes of information that is not clear on the what to understand the why....."
good,"DaVita Inc. is a innovating organization and it is considerably a fast paced environment. Managers have to be flexible with ideas, work schedule and changes within the organization. The hardest part about the organization is staffing issues due to the fact that DaVita is not very competitive in salary which give competitors the opportunity to recruit valuable teammates."
good,"Working for DaVita has been able to teach me tremendous amounts. I have learned outstanding organization, patient accountability, and the true importance of teamwork."
good,a great place to work where the mission and values are alive and well. Full of really smart individuals striving to improve healthcare.
good,"Good company. Good support staff. It is a national company that provides   hemodialysis, nocturnal dialysis and peritoneal dialysis dilaysis."
good,I enjoyed my time at Davita although it was for a short time and I would've loved to continue my employment there.
good,"If learning to work with dialysis patients is something that you are interested in then this is a great start, however there is no great room for promotion unless you go to school for nursing."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,We work hard in a fast paced environment that is enjoyable.  We have a work out room and we always have lunches provided by the company.
good,"Check patients dry weight, set up machine, keep eye on patients while doing treatment."
good,"Teammates are great. Growing business with a lot of changes."
good,Great company that offers advanced opportunities. A typical day at work was communicating with patients and their families while working in a supportive environment. Co-workers friendly. Hardest part of job was juggling multiple facilities with considerable distance involved with small children at home.
good,I covered 32 hospitals in 4 states and managed 13 direct reports.
good,"I really enjoy what I do. I love case management, educating patients, ability to make decisions, working with physicians, and my schedule."
good,"Arrive at work at 4:00am, patients arrive at 5:00am. Work continually until time to leave around 8:30pm. The hardest part is being on your feet for such a long period of time. The best part is actually getting to know the patients on a personal level."
good,"Good, fast growing company. Management is for the most part competent."
good,Making a difference in someone life by providing the best customer service and always going above and beyond .
good,"A typical day started at 4:30 a.m. we prepared the dialysis machines for the first group of patience that started coming in at 6 a.m. we put the patients on the machines and monitored them for the duration of their treatment times which could be from 2 to 4 hours at a time. my coworkers were personable and helpful. Management was personable and understanding as well as helpful. the hardest part of the job was getting attached to the patients and due to them being so ill it would make is very hard when patients would pass away. the most enjoyable part of the job was only working 3 days a week but being able to get to know the patients. I also answered phones prepared lab work, checked patients in and out of the facility."
good,25 years of co-ownership of a Flower shop with my late husband..  Enjoyed this job very much.
good,"Hours are long and sometime breaks and lunches taken. But the job is wonderful and you can get the experience that is needed. Hardest part of the job is trying to make sure that patients are put on at the correct time. Co-workers were ok, but I guess it is like any other job worked. I had a joy to work with the patients, they were my heart."
good,"They is no typical work day at a dialysis clinic.  You never know what you are going to walk into in the morning.  One day it could be a code going on when you walk in or sunshine and puppies."
good,It is a good company. Pier Diem rate is good. Hourly rate could be a lot better.
good,"	Evaluate new and existing clinical studies and processing requirements to determine if requested clinical study can be performed"
good,"I loved everything about this job, except for the location.  It was too far."
good,"all  aforementioned comments, as well as cooperative, team-oriented co-workers."
good,DaVita is a company that offers dialysis. They hire many people to administer dialysis to patients who need it and compensate them on a bi-weekly basis. They are an enormously profit driven company and continuously improve ways to make it more profitable. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that the work I do helps to make a few individuals incredibly wealthy.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Well I travel via public transportation as it is easier and somewhat reliable as the distance of the job is a ways from my home. I start at 8 and I assist patients, SW and discharge planners most of the day. I also do a bit of administrative work within my day as well. I leave work at 4:30. I have learned so much about patients on dialysis which helped me personally in my life as my step father became diagnosed with end stage renal disease this year. I became knowledgable in this field and was able to help so much in regards to the different types of dialysis options and diet etc. Management is really good here. They are really here for you and support you 100% with anything you do. The co workers here have always made me feel welcome from day one and taught me how to be a great co worker as well. We have core values that we live by here at DaVita and Fun is one of them. We live by all of them each day. The hardest part of the job is sometimes listening to the concerns the patients have and the struggles that they endure each day with this disease. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning something new each day, working with my great co workers and management team and the awesome holiday parties or the teammate appreciation stuff they do for all of us great teammates!"
good,"Performs patient care responsibilities for dialysis treatment, gathers patient data and vital signs, including blood samples, culture specimens. Initiate and terminate dialysis treatments with fistula, graft or catheter. Documentation, set up, operation, cleaning and disinfecting dialysis related equipment. Prepare, administer, and record medications as allowed by state regulations participate in the care center."
good,Administer treatments and monitor patients with ESRD...I am passionate about my patients.
good,"Great company to work for! Outstanding in training, personal and professional development."
good,"I was here for a short period of time on an assignment through a temp agency. While there I did notice that it was a very quiet office. It appeared that they did not like people communicating with each other during the work day."
good,"Enjoy working one-one with patients/clients."
good,Prepare and administer dialysis treatments to patients. Very fast paced and detail oriented environment.
good,"DaVita is excellent in teamwork within the company; this  is essential for the satisfaction and loyalty of the Teammates and Patients, because they are our customers."
good,"I loved this company because of the hard work everyone contributed to helping patients. My manager lived in another state, and I had such a large territory to attend to. The hardest part of the job was to balance my personal life because there was hardly anytime since no one else in my territory with the same job title who could assist me. So my desire to go back to school was impossible."
good,"great company. they hire many temps though, wish they would be more stable in that aspect"
good,"Cannulation of vistular and gortex graph accesses. Machine setup and breakdown,trobleshooting,patient monitoring,vital signs,and some biotechnical duties."
good,Delivering Hemodialysis treatment to patient at the start of 530am til 630pm with each patient running between 3-4 hours. I have learned that being pro active and working as a team player would always spell the difference in improving the quality of care that each patient receive.  The hardest part of the job is that very long hour shift. Enjoyable is establishing a good relationship to patient and colleague.
good,"Generally very good company to work for. Love working with the patients. Some staff can be challenging to work with, but I think this has to do with poor management. Company benefits are very good. Workdays are very busy, many days you may not have time to break for lunch. Lot of work on your feet."
good,"A typical day of work consist of spending time with patients while they are receiving their treatments, which is very fulfilling to be able to be a part of lives and getting to know them. Along with my other co-workers we do have many days of laughter as well as getting the work done that needs to be done, which makes the day a more pleasent day. Though, the hardest part of the day is to see those patients come that are not feeling well and are just having a bad day. I enjoy all my patients and the time that I get to spend with them and to see the smile on their face when thet leave after their treatment."
good,Making sure that payroll submission is in timely manner so that I can pay employees
good,"fast paced, challenging environment, with continuos growth with in the company."
good,"It is a great place to work with a fun corporate culture, but the pace of the company can be overwhelming at times. It's hard to work less than 50-60 hours each week, but knowing that you are helping a dialysis patient live a healthier life is more than rewarding."
good,The knowledge of knowing I was really helping someone who really needed it
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,A typical day consisted of waking up and heding out to a dialysis facility to speak with patients. I learned how to extract personal information from people in a very short periodof time.Management was not available in person only by phone due to the nature of the job and its travel. The co-workers were awesome and the support they provided was invaluable. The hardest part of the job was being away from home 4 out of 5 days each week. The loss of patients on regular basis was also difficult. Due to the nature of the locations people were sick and would most likely die in the event of missing treatments. Often times people would just give up and not want to spend the rest of their life so they would stop treatment. Approximately 7 days later it would be over. the most enjoyable part of the job was when a patient would find a donor. This would be the best chance of survival for most of the patients.
good,I have received a great experience in working with dialysis. I learned something new everyday which is amazing.
good,Great people to work with. Fun place to work. Great schedule.
good,davita is good place to work.....giving care to the patients with chronic kidney diseases.
good,Very young company that has decided to go in a unique way. It's company that cares for it's patients and treats its employees like family memebers. I have learned how a team together can make the smallest difference in someones life. My co-workers are always willing to help and teach when asked.
good,acquired great communication skills
good,"great place to work, great bosses, and expanding very quickly"
good,...just need to find the right clinic with a good FA that supports the staff.
good,I truly believe in my clinic and teammates who are compassionate and caring.  My Facility Administrator is an amazing manager as well as a caring person for her staff and patients.
good,"Everyday is same, but not. challenges are daily, very fast paced, lots of physical work, long days with lots of work. schedule should be 3 days of 12 hour shifts, but staff is short so you are working sometimes 4-5 days a week, Saturdays are required, every other unless you are a TTS team mate."
good,"The hardest part of workng here is that is was very busy but time went by quickly. Always received your lunches, which i was always missing at other units."
good,I love working for DaVita at times it can get a little stressful and coworkers can get on your nerves but that’s at any job..  I love what I do.  Plus there is room for advancement
good,I have been working with this company for 10+ years. I really enjoy working here and feel I get a lot of support from the company and teammates. I just wish the compensation was more competitive.
good,I enjoy my work environment and the ability to provide more one on one care. They provide a wonderful training to people new to dialysis. They provide uniforms
good,The company is all about teamwork and helping others. Everyday there is something different never a routine when fo to work. Working with the right people can make your job enjoy it.
good,"Requires a lot of hours. Minimum of 12 hours, more if with delays at work. Challenging at times. Routine work for the most part. Management can have a lot to improve on."
good,"Been with Davita for 10 years, and it was a good place to work up until recently. The past two years have been the worse. Management doesn't care about it's employees and they feel you are just a number."
good,"manager is great staff is okay. company has really bad insurance plans, and is very unorganized. went out on maternity and never got paid because in the state they are based out of they have different laws."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,It is a good working environment with new equipment and building. They’ve got a flexible schedule. It’s a fun filled job. It starting pay may not be that great but it’s a good place to work
good,"Very willing to hire new nurses. Overall a good company to work for with decent benefits, short work week but up to 15 hour work days. My region/clinic has trouble keeping staff and management so consistently short staffed with little leadership but that is specific to my clinic and does not speak to experiences with the company as a whole. Great place to really form a bond with patients and make a difference in their lives and management of their disease process."
good,I enjoyed working at Davita for the sake of learning discipline and having the opportunity to challenge myself and the skills that the company itself taught in training
good,I am challenged to provide a review at this time as the local culture does not match the corporate culture.  DaVita's mission and values are something to be admired.
good,"Dynamic, strong, team-focused environment in a company committed to revolutionizing health care."
good,"DaVita is a great company, however, each facility is managed by  a FA and wok environment totally depends on who is the FA of the facility. Each division is managed differently. This is but my opinion."
good,Poor compensation comparing to what employee is told.  Company is  great for assisting patients but poor quality in job placement advancing.  There has not been managerial back up support.
good,"My role required a lot of over time. The job was simple enough, and they gave you plenty of training, even if you have never worked in dialysis before. What made me leave was the severe lack of mobility."
good,"Overall a good place to work great employees. Management okay to work for sometime not very knowledgeable at times. Opportunity to get promoted and lot of hours, always short staffed."
good,"The company doesn't pay their employees well. the expectations to over a large amount of patients safely, is ridiculius. They should have safe patient to staff ratio."
good,"My time at DaVita was very rewarding. It had food luncheons every month, and a talent show every Halloween."
good,"I can be trusted to do what I am asked and will gladly step in when needed in other areas of the team. I genuinely care for and support, not only those to whom I provide assistance to, but also other teammates."
good,"Not really sure if a review is necessary, seeing as how the company is going under at this time.  But the work environment was very casual and usually not too stressful."
good,"I enjoyed working for Davita. I am relocating to Tampa to a warmer"
good,"Working at Davita is a challenging & interesting job. but flexible to my needs. I never work in the job environment that deal directly with patients before. However, As I learn this through work experience I realized that working with DaVita is very interesting to my needs. They offer you flexible hours and they offer you the opportunity to learn other job that you are interested in and they are willing to train you to be the best."
good,"A typical day as a patient account specialist, is based around a book of business that is given based on facilities within the states your team works. It's a lot of work load management, which gives me the time to balance meetings and other responsibilities. DaVita is about fun and they try to incorporate that value everyday, like a company picnic, holiday parties, fun homerooms, teammate appreciation day. Work life balance is easier now that I am not an Admissions coordinator. There was a lot of stress to that position. Management can be iffy if your aren't liked. You can definitely move around but in order to get a decent salary increase you have to jump departments. There is no decent increase within the position already held besides like 1 or 2 percent max. I think a lot of it based on how much management likes you not because of your hard work."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Love my patients and teammates.  However, working 60+ hours a week and is challenging for work/life balance.  The position is extremely stressful at this time due to changes in the division/region.  Overall, DaVita is a wonderful company.  I hate to leave but can not work at this pace any longer."
good,"Long hours, not always adequately staffed, frequent employee schedule changes. High employee turnover rate. Fast paced but compassionate patient care."
good,The company that I went to work for was great and I loved working there for several years but they made mistakes and then forgot their values. They forgot why they were there in order to fix mistakes and cut costs.
good,"A busy place to work, it can  stressful at times and hours are unpredictable, 10 hours or more in a given day.  But you will learn a lot regarding dialysis world."
good,Great company to work for. They work with you if you work with them :D benefits aren’t the best but great people. We are a village who supports one another.
good,i have a great boss but co worker can cause you to have bad day by there own negativity company truly cares about it employees and offer some good incentive
good,"DaVita is a great company; however, I feel I do not work with others who have the same education as I do. Because of this, I feel the company is at a disadvantage by not utilizing more educational experience."
good,"I love my job as a dialysis nurse. I'm looking to get back into direct patient care. I want to keep up on my skills in critical care. Being a nurse is a privilege that I hold dear to my heart. I can work up to 20 hours a day as a Acute Dialysis RN. Job is fast paced, critical thinking Is most important. Every treatment is keeping patients alive, giving them life!  I work independently, travel to multiple facilities/ hospitals daily."
good,"I was hired for a specific project.  Company provides excellent training and information."
good,Learned a lot from providers and staff all three years. Enjoyed working for this company as it gave me the experience I have and needed to continue my work ethic.
good,"As a biomed there is not a usual typical work day.  This role has many variances depending on equipment status, preventative maintenance due, monthly reports and number of facilities handled. "
good,"Work was heavy , but good for a workalcohic. Had new equipment and some facilities had extra personnel available to help their nurses. Management was usually someone without dialysis skills. Most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with patients."
good,Nothing at this point to say about company I enjoy my job just unerpaid and over worked and don't feel like employees are treated fairly at times for all the services weprovide the vacations are nice the 401k is nice and my patients are awsome there is just alot of over looked things behind closed oops
good,"I enjoyed being able to work remotely and able to manage how my day went.  The job environment in each facility was different, some employees would go out of their way to help others would not do anything above what they were assigned to do.  My most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with the patients."
good,"Overall, I love my job. The most rewarding part is the relationships with my team & patients. You will have bad FA's & good ones. The team you work with and your contribution is what makes it a good day or a bad one. This is not a slow paced job. If you are weak dont apply. I wish I could accrue more time off faster. I wish the pay was more. I still love my job."
good,"Co-workers are great and patient are awesome but not all of them though. Great benefits but low pay for nurses, otherwise I would have stay full-time."
good,I love my job and my patients. I don't like that other employees can be late all the time and everyone else has to do the extra work. The management is not good. The pay is decent and you don't have to have experience.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,I loved the relationships built with the patients and the rapport that helped patients improve with compliance in their health care. Providing the patients with on going educations and seeing how much the patients benefit from the education is a major plus of being a Registered Nurse/Team leader
good,"Love what I do, this job is not for everyone. Very fast pace.  Very long hours or you don't your hours. They are big on education and training. I love working with my pt."
good,"A normal day at Davita is really busy,dealing with a lot patients. What I learned at Davita was time management, some of the nurse skills,for as passing dialysis medication and what its used for. The hardest part at Davita is getting close to the patients,getting a really good bond with and the passed away. Last but not least, The most enjoyable is seeing them come the doors and smiling."
good,"with sometimes 4 patient loads."
good,DaVita means he/she gives life. Rewarding experience providing administrative and clinical support to E.S.R.D (end stage renal disease) patients. DaVita more like a village than a company
good,"Its hard work but comes with a vary satisfying reward from the patients and their overall well-being. Social life and work is a vary skewed balance but then again, we are not here for us, we are here for the patients."
good,"Much of my day was related to psychosocial needs of patients. I assisted with travel arrangements and often provided patient education to treatment options, ESRD and dietary and nursing back up support.  I was not involved with transportation issues."
good,"It is a good Company to work for, if you are able to balance work and Life. It is very fast paced and work is always there to keep you busy. Co-workers are great Support to get thru the day. Supervisors need more empathy for staff during physical injury/recovery."
good,"DaVita does have it good and bad parts about it but in the end when it comes to working in health care what company doesn't? Being an RN at this company you are responsible for everything that goes on while in the center. It is quick paced, with a high ratio of patients. On a typical day the ratio can be 1:12 or 1:8. Which in dialysis is doable but you are on your feet the whole day. So get some good shoes! They are flexable with hours, which is great. The job isn't that demanding of you, but it can be physical. You will not need a yoga class because all day you are stretching, moving, bending, cleaning (constantly). So be prepared. It is a nice environment to work in because you build great relationships with your patients when you normally wouldn't in a hospital. Best of Luck!"
good,My team is wonderful that makes being  at work at 4:45 in the morning bearable. There are opportunities for advancement with lots if training. There are locations all over the US so if you are moving you can transfer to another clinic.
good,"Davita was is like a family, build up of your co-workers and patients. As like all jobs it had its up points and low points, but overall it was a          awesome company to work for."
good,"DaVita is a great company to work for. I have been a dialysis nurse working in all aspects of dialysis care for 30 years. DaVita is truly a patient oriented company, and patients come first before business. I have been provided many opportunities to advance my career. DaVita has tools for just about anything you need to learn. The most enjoyable part of the job is the Patients we care for. Some are a challenge and some are just delightful. Hardest part of the job is trying to keep teammates happy while holding them accountable for their duties."
good,"I've been here for over 11 years, I love working here; however, we we're recently told that my position and that of 18 others in a very similar position is being eliminated.  So the job security isn't there."
good,Davita is a company with a great culture but a tremendous work load. Expectations for work completion is very high and often times redundant work can make the month monotonous. Management is somewhat effective but the goals and promises do not always translate into reality for the front line employees.
good,"Compensation below average.  Work/life balance - not so much.  There is a lot of driving required for this role. DaVita reimburses for mileage but it is not enough for the amount of wear and tear that you put on your personal car.  "
good,"DaVita is a very nice place to work. Work days are very long, but overall the patients and staff are welcoming. The hardest part of the job is the long hours, but it is made up for with typically only working three days a week."
good,"I like my job at DaVita, but it is time for me to focus on achieving a career where I can use my degree."
good,Fast paced work environment. Work 3 to 4 days Monday through Saturday with Sundays off.  Great teammates and work environment.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Great place to work. Challenging, fun, long hours at times but worth every penny. Enjoyable part of the job is taking care and talking with your clients"
good,"Team in quality care, fun and spirit. you will have hours and learn new things, there are opportunity for growth and advancement."
good,"It was a great experience, I looked forward to going to work and working with positive coworkers (teammates) I enjoy the field of nephrology,and look forward to further employment in this field."
good,"The work place at Davita was different that is for sure. At Davita you did not work for a Company it was a Village and that made it different. The word Davita meant ""He or She gives life"", working for a company that gave me the joy of making a difference in someone's life."
good,"DaVita has some great ideas on employee core values and employee participation, but some departments and management do not fully believe in the company mission statement and core values which is detrimental to morale and employee  enthusiasm to perform to their highest level.  Overall the company has some very good ideas and approaches to Healthcare."
good,"I loved the core values of DaVita, I however wished that they would have backed up their word. They need to follow their own core values."
good,"The sky is the limit with DaVita.  The culture is filled with fun, but plenty of challenging work.  The DaVita culture certainly explemplfies TEAM - everyone truly does succeed together. "
good,I come in in the mornings and work on my schedule.  Go onto treatment floor and see if any thing happened to any patient after I left.  Management is ok and my co-workers are great.  The hardest part of my job is having one of my patients die.  The best part is being able to help them in any way that I can.
good,"A fun company with great core values, Everyday is something new. Every one is part of a team and we all help give life to patients."
good,Typical work day is busy. Learn a lot. Management not always available. Co-worker are pleasant but over-workedt. Requires multi-tasking. Love patient interaction.
good,"Solid Company, good job security. I enjoy patient care, I just wish there was more emphasis on the patients."
good,"Great company, excellent training in company! On the dialysis center level, training was adequate. Poor moral, rules not enforced  (people repeatably not showing up for work with no consequences) Always short staff, a lot of required overtime. Suppose to get bonuses for standards being met, never saw any. As a RN, mostly tech work, which is fine, but little use of my RN skills. Management: hit or miss, some centers with great managers, some terrible! Find out before you accept a job! Enjoyed patients, however unlike most medical facilities, noncompliant patients are extremely catered to, pretty annoying!"
good,"I love working at this company. I've learned so much and I appreciate the opportunity to be apart of a great company. The core values focus on the best for you, your teammates and patients but if you don't have a FA that believes in the same things as the company, it isn't going to work."
good,"I love Davita's Core Values because they closely align with my own values.  Davita is a wonderful company to work for, the culture is one of a kind."
good,"Dialysis done at 2 different hospitals.  Set up of machines, doing water check and machine checks.  Accessing pt either with port or graft.  Checking physician orders and setting up machine per physicians orders."
good,"When I came to DaVita, I had no previous health care training.  Although I didn't always have direct patient interaction, my position within DaVita gave me a real sense of purpose knowing that I was doing something that was helping someone else that truly needed it.  I grew to love the FUN DaVita likes to put in everything.  I also had opportunities to meeting many leaders within DaVita from Directors up to Senior VPs.  It's a great place to work and hope that I have the opportunity to if not work for DaVita, find another company that aligns itself similarly."
good,"Majority of time was spent collecting data for training statistics used in various reports and presentations, troubleshooting problems teammates had with our learning management system, training new teammates on how to complete monthly reports, provide telephone support to teammates in the field and refer questions to proper person. Assisted in converting the data collection from a manual system to a computerized system.  The hardest part was trying to pull data quickly for someone who waited until the day before or day they needed it for a presentation.  The whole department would pull together to get the information in time for the presentation.  I would occasionally travel to support at meetings or do training for new teammates.  This is something that made the job very enjoyable."
good,In working in the corporate office if had it's challenges.The rules on dialysis change very frequently. The team of managers were always easy to work with as were the social workers.I enjoyed this job as there seemed to be a lot of charity events to raise money to assist in our patients who weren't properly insured to cover the cost of their treatments.
good,I follow the guidelines of the SIP program. As a student I shaddow  certified patient care technician and can only perform limited hands on skills under direct supervision
good,There are not many insurance options. The operations of the department are a direct reflection of the communication and organization of leadership. If you get stuck with a bad manager you are out of luck. You have to deal with it until you can post out. 
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,• Delivery of all dialysis related nursing services for the End Stage Renal Disease patient in a chronic setting.
good,I am a contract Employee and have enjoyed my time here thus far.
good,"As part of a large SW Dev team, I was documenting a 12yo medical software applications written in Delphi w/out documentation. Target is new app done in .NET/C#."
good,"Highly demanding, fast paced workplace that is very results oriented. I've had the opportunity to learn all facets of a revenue cycle, and move into the technology area with emphasis using Oracle and UNIX. ."
good,Good people to work with. patients are the highlight every day.
good,"Davita has a good concept of teamwork ,nice place to advance in management ."
good,"Typical day starts around four am and ends around four pm, I have learned that I can do things that I wasn't sure I could do before. My coworkers are great. The hardest part of my job is getting through turn over. The most enjoyable part is getting to know my patients."
good,"I learned so much about kidney dialysis. How the machines worked, how to hook them up, why kidney dialysis was needed, and how to take care of different patients with different dialysis needs."
good,It’s a great place to work with a lot of promotions. Believes in providing safe and efficient patient care. Thrive on team work. Patient focus and many great benefits.
good,"A normal day at work consist of filing papers, call the patients rides for transportation back home. Scheduling appointments, answering phones, counting medications, faxing/scanning paperwork!"
good,Amazing core values and company belief system if you can find good leadership to work under and make the schedule work for you. Truly an opportunity to touch the lives of patients and make a lasting impression.
good,"Several years of Intensive Care nurse successfully advancing the health, comfort, and wellness of patients."
good,"DaVita is a very large company with offices all over the United States.I had teh ability to work remotely and it did not affect the collegiality I felt with other members of my department.  This was due to frequent conference calls/skype-type meetings. A drawback with working for such a large corporation can mean basic tasks are very procedure/process-heavy-and everything must be documented in a database.  That being said, most people I encountered at work were great to work with, hard-working and took their work as seriously as I did.  I highly recommend working for DaVita."
good,"The work experience was amazing, and the patients were really wonderful as well but it was extremely difficult to work there while I had a newborn baby. Unless you have a reliable childcare or your children are older I wouldn’t recommend this job for anyone."
good,I like my job and the company just finding it hard to pay my bills with the budget hours being lowered I was hired for 36 hours only work 27 most weeks
good,"A place with a standard culture, with team work at the center, and patient care as the focus. Flexibility in terms that you can relocate to any of 4,000 clinics all over the USA and Hawaii."
good,"Culture more than market compensation is a driver. The company is big on culture, metrics and developing from within. Very big on culture. How much more do I have to write?"
good,The culture is open and friendly. There is opportunity to work remotely. Davita dose a lot of good work for the community and is always ready to help.
good,"I've never worked with a more highly talented workforce!  Opportunities to work on different projects or cross-functional teams abound.  The culture is rich but can be difficult to navigate and those who don't fit get weeded out and passed over for promotions.  Pay below the higher levels is fairly low compared to market.  "
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Fast paced environment."
good,"I loved this job. You actually save lives. Connect with patients and staff was friendly. The hours are good but if you don’t pass the test, they will fire you!!"
good,"A great opportunity to learn dialysis the Davita Way. Infection control is highly monitored as well as patients safety. However, there is a difficult  balance with the work and home life."
good,"I did learn a great deal about Dialysis from my co-workers and physicians. The hours are long considering I was hired for 10 hours I would work greater than 12 hours per shift, but it's for the benefit of the patient. Certain members of the staff were cut throat, and certain physicians were none the better. I can think of two  nurses in particular. When reported to my director, little if any action was being taken to address and correct this behavior, I suppose it was her fear that any of these two would resign and leave her staff in the lurch. But that is speculation.  Because of this behavior, I resigned."
good,"DaVita has an excellent corporate culture, values, and mission. While of course the experience at an individual clinic will vary, it is generally a positive, upbeat place to be."
good,"The hardest part of the job is having to manage 2 or more clinics on a daily/ weekly basis. Another issue is the commute between facilities. Some clinic does not have enough PD patients, therefore, most PD nurse has 2 or more facilities in order to obtain FT hours."
good,"Direct care employees worked well together however, it was always a 6-1 ratio. We were always understaffed except when someone higher up was visiting."
good,"Like most companies of its size,they could pay employee,more to make ends meet. Companies of their size should do more to provide higher wages and more affordable health care options. They are very good at company culture being fun but I found a lot of co workers struggled and need more for their Family at home."
good,Retention of new hire PCT and nurses are an issue. Bonuses for helping other clinics have been cut. Shortage of staff is a huge problem because of new hire retention issues. There is still low respect for nurses from the PCT’s.
good,"A typical day at work consist of setting up machines, making potassium baths for the floor, documenting during treatment of the patient, reviewing care  plans, meeting with nursing team about changes in the patients condition, cleaning machines, canulating the patient, needle removal, setting appointments for patient access, monitor the cannulation site, and anything else ask of me by my supervisor. The most enjoyable and hardest part of this job is patient outcomes. Life is so unpredictable, your greatest efforts can fail sometimes but can also produce some of the most amazing outcomes."
good,"DaVita is a great place to work in terms of work-life balance, and the people there are great. However, the pay is horrible, and they know it, but they do not care. They will tell you how great of a job you're doing, but do no compensate you for it at all. It's actually pretty terrible and makes you feel less than."
good,Good questions. I have worked for company and received much training over the past 8 and a half years and have meet and grown to love many wonderful patients.
good,"This was a good place to work but it was only a part-time position.  However, it did offer full-time benefits. I enjoyed working with staff and patients. My trainer was very impatient and unprofessional in her training methods."
good,"The team environment and culture are the best parts of DaVita. Everyone is hard-working, driven and truly want to help each other as much as we help our patients. The culture is one of the best I've ever encountered. "
good,Work changes to try to meet new demands of the ever-growing patient population. This places additional stress on the teammates and can lead to a decline in the amount of teammates that want to work for the company. The skills learned about patient and teammate interaction are invaluable.
good,"productive environment. you can advance in job placement. management is just there. the work is repetitive but demanding, benefits are great. you an work from clinic to clinic."
good,"It's ok.  ..... it's very variable unit to unit manager to manager. Some people get away with more than others. Each unit has a bullying issue that seems to be accepted because of the old adage "" nurses eat their young"""
good,I worked for Davita for close to ten years and it is a very employee driven company. The caveat being that the right manager is working you for growth and career advancement.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,If you want to work hard then Davita is the company for you! Good management is dependent upon which clinic you are placed. Staffing is usually short for nursing.
good,"Clean and disinfect machine, chairs, and equipment. Assure all blood spills are correctly and effectively cleaned up. Evaluate patient's weight and document patient's pre and post vitals. Collect and label lab samples. Observe and report any signs of infection or personal problems, to the RN or social worker in charge. Apply appropriate dressing and cannulate access per procedure and policy. Record accurate documentation needed every half an hour. Conduct all machine safety checks needed. Evaluate patient's access and report any possible signs of stenosis or clotting to RN. Discontinue treatment per policy and procedure. Perform duties as assigned. Efficient worker and team player."
good,"This company is a good company to work for however, changes in management are frequent.  The company is also being sold.  I believe if you do not want to advance in the near future, it is a good place to work."
good,"A typical day at work was as follows:"
good,Learned a lot about medical Social Work.  Your building culture depends on the facility administrator & most buildings the morale was  low.  Hardest part:  always adding more work with no increase in pay.  Working with the patients was good they become like family.
good,"DaVita is a Different Place to Work.  It is not your Typical place .......It is hard to explain.  If you are a work a holic this is definitely NOT the place you want to be at!!!!!!!!  "
good,I enjoyed working at DaVita RX. I really made some close connections with the patients. The culture at DaVita RX is amazing. The typical workday could be hectic but it was always enjoyable. Some of the patients would share stories which could be very interesting.
good,good place to work. hours are long and you never know when u will be done. fast paced and sometimes overwhelming! they do offer  the emplyees good incentives and bonuses
good,The hours are crazy and long but that comes with the territory. Davita was a great company to work for. Very strict but thats a good thung in my opinion.
good,Davita  is a fast pace environment on your feet at least 12 hours a day very challenging  every day was a new experience and the patients were very friendly despite having Chronic kidney disease.
good,The culture is great but they do not pay well across all departments.  Sometimes the culture can be a little too much but overall I enjoyed my time there!
good,"Endless hours available for work and overtime.  If you want to work 365 days a year, this is the company for you.  That is also the problem - you burn out quickly."
good,"DaVita has a great mission statement and I LOVE the patients whom we serve daily. Dialysis is a tough job, but it I very rewarding! Each day brings a new challenge but also each day bring a sense of pride knowing that a persons life was spared on more day because they were able to receive treatment."
good,"I practically lost a personal life once I began working for DaVita. Although they try very hard to make it easy for you to balance your work and personal life, it never seems to work."
good,"I""ve been working here for 1.5years. I love what I do but the hours make it difficult. The start time is usually 4:30am until 5pm or later. That makes it hard for mothers with children. Also for it to be such a specialized field, I feel as though the pay could be a little better. But the company is generous with perks, free lunches and offering of discounted perks with major name brands and companies. Great company if you don't mind the early hours."
good,"4 patients to each tech, great environment if you love caring for people hard work but you are trained on everything you learn. Must be able to work on one accord with teammates and work really long hours."
good,They work long hours with minimal staff. Loss a lot of long term employees due to  the long hours with minimal staffing. Unable to take sick time due to there not being enough coverage.
good,"DaVita's culture can be a blessing & a curse in that it encourages hard work with minimal complaints. A lot of people end up in a position where they have taken on a ton of work that was not in their job description, but they are not compensated appropriately unless there is a linear promotion available within the department. The company has great professional & personal development opportunities."
good,Company culture is good community feel. The work that they do is very beneficial to patients. Changing healthcare landscape is putting a lot of pressure on ability to serve patients.
good,Davita is a great company with multiple departments. The company has great managers and an awesome work culture but it is difficult to obtain career advancement.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"DaVita is a great place to work; people are strategic and driven to perform. However, career advancement is difficult and people can get ""stuck"" in their role."
good,"When I was with DaVita HealthCare Partners as a Patient Liaison a typical day was fast paced preparing for the day to interact with patients, doctors, medical assistants, department supervisors, meetings and daily duties. Daily duties involved follow up with patients, medical assistants, doctors and supervisors. Working as a Patient Liaison we had to be able to lead a team so that the workplace was a cohesive and enjoyable place to work. The hardest part of the job was during the Annual Enrollment Period because along with everyday tasks that was when the senior patients had the most questions about their health plans which can be very confusing for some, fortunately I am very familiar in that area and was able to comprehensively explain and clear up any questions that the patient may have had. The most enjoyable part was being able to help so many patients and co-workers alike."
good,"It takes time to get used to the culture; I enjoyed it. DaVita lives the culture and does not just preach it.  They invest much time, energy and dollars to making the culture organic."
good,"I did a variety of jobs due to my experience. I could ""fill in"" in most operations areas. I learned to 'juggle several balls' at a time and the importance of being adaptable."
good,Overall I enjoyed my experience with Davita. They were short staffed and I was required to work up o 18 hrs on a Saturday which I find unacceptable. Along with bosses that refused to work a shift to help keep us from burning out being short staffed.
good,"Core Values relevant to my life. Training opportunity great I learned management skills, leadership skills and became an expert in my field.  Flexibility with limited supervision which allow me to be a self starter."
good,"This was a very busy position. I enjoyed making the patients happy. By doing this, I created fun events for them to participate in. They really enjoyed holiday activities."
good,"DaVita"
good,Davita was a great overall experience. I was able to advance my computer and phone skills while building experience in the healthcare industry.  Superb employee interaction and collaboration in order to achieve placement of dialysis patients.
good,Good company to work for. No opportunity for advancement if you're not a nurse. Doctors that came in to the clinic to visit w/ patients were good to work with.
good,A busy and usually stressful day. A mostly capable group of fellow employees to work with. The hardest part of the job was not having relief in the past year. I truly enjoyed the patients and will miss them very much.
good,"They are continuously laying off . However it is a good company to work for.  The pay is reasonable, the benefits are fair. I would recommend this company to my family members and friends."
good,"Definitely a fun environment. The teammates make the company what it is The company goes out of it's way to make sure teammates are recognized and that they all have a good time while at work. "
good,"Great place if you're looking for a lot of over time and traveling in between clinics. Policy and procedures constantly changed due to one of their core values which is Continuous Improvement. It can be stressful when people from downtown headquarters come down to observe you and make as  many of bad marks as they can. There is a bonus if your clinic does good by the end of some of their reports and statistics. Reasonable pay raises. If you have children it would be a hard life-work balance, but for those who have the time, you have an opportunity to make good money in a good company with good benefits. They also have tuition assistance for nursing. And after a year of working, if you do happen to have a baby, they give you money certificate for that as well. They do care about their employees at this clinic, so free lunch was provided a lot. Colleagues rely on each other to cover hours and shifts, which can be a lot. Paid maternity leave. You do need certification which they will help you schedule a date after a year of working, if you are committed."
good,"Powerfully driven by culture in decision-making and performance"
good,"Good job to have. It's a very physically taxing job. Some people are hard to work with here because they don't know how to go with the flow. Besides that, it's not hard to show up to work everyday."
good,If you want a job with autonomy and specific tasks this is the job. This job will require patience and a willingness to be flexible with your schedule.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Had a lot of great moments with my teammates, I learned quite a bit about dialysis the seven years i worked there.  It was a great experience, got to know and work with patients... it was very rewarding, knowing that you are helping them live longer.  The hardest part of my job was, coming to work and finding out that one of them passed away."
good,"There is no regrets becoming a PCT nor working for the company. It is a lot career advancements to grow. Before you apply to become PCT, you must have a passion to really do what you love to help save patients lives in dialysis."
good,"DaVita holds a different healthcare environment. First day on the job, it didn't feel like an out-patient clinic. In some cases we probably see these patients more than their relatives. They commit to their life by coming to see us every other day, it's like their part-time job. Engaging with the patients and discovering who they were before they experienced a sudden change of lifestyle, in my most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Opportunities to learn new processes. Little growth, little benefits. Poor management. Friendly environment and coworkers are great to work with. However, management will overwhelm you with workload with little compensation"
good,"The company has great values and I enjoyed the patients immensely. Working at DaVita taught me about myself more...taught me how to be a better team player, good work ethic, and how to be a better person as a whole. The team was great and I enjoyed my management. The compensation eventually wasn't doable because I have aspirations of becoming independent and also there were no advancement opportunities,"
good,"Very culture strong - you either love it or hate it. I can feel like a lot of forced fun or a strong community. DaVita tries to build a lot of excitement around concepts and ideas sometimes making things too ""Disney"" or avoiding anything considered negative. The problem is without addressing issues, they cannot be solved."
good,"Great company to work for.  Great balance work and life.  Managers need more training, they tend to micromanage people.  Pay is competitive in Denver is not so much outside markets."
good,"One of their core values is fun, it can be...but it can also be a bit cheesy and forced...."
good,"Good work, great learning.  Promotions can be tricky.  C Suite has favorites and if you are not a part of that crowd hard to keep moving up. Overall interesting work and meaningful mission."
good,dialysis is the same everywhere but davita does give bonuses. i enjoyed my patients and my co workers there. management needs to be trained and not just given because you work someplace.
good,Great culture and opportunity for advancement. Always room for improvement but DaVita does a great job of listening to the teammates on continuous improvement.
good,"very hard but rewarding job . Typical day non stop patient care ."
good,"A typical day at work, depending on if it is a payroll week or not will determine my work load, but generally payroll, time keeping, some general ledger audits, reporting and such, sending and receiving e-mails regarding payroll questions, research on returned checks or unclaimed property, Direct deposit reconcilations, overpayment calculations and more."
good,I enjoyed working with patients and their families. Each patient was unique in their own way. I also worked side by side interesting co workers and knowledgeable nurses. Patient care has always been a great field to work in.
good,Always plenty to do with a modge podge of things to face at any given time. Things I did include reviewing and faxing patient charts as well as helping to start new patients. Auditing patient charts. Assisting with guests in the main lobby.
good,"I enjoyed my short tenure with DaVita, I had looked forward to a long career with them. They were amiable in moving people up the chain of management if an employee was interested. They were very helpful when a sudden family issue arouse and I had to take an extended time off. Unfortunately, that family issue was in another country and I was unable to return to work due to the length and issues involved."
good,"My regular days includes Logging into my computer, checking emails, check with the team lead, I was part of the VA Triage Team."
good,"The best part about DaVita from an RD perspective is that the company affords a lot of flexibility and autonomy. Advancement opportunities, however, are minimal. Compensation is fair, but not overly generous."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Each department is really different,  some are difficult to work for.  I can't speak for all, but I have seen some that were very good and some that were less desirable."
good,"Love what we are and what DaVita stands for: We give life! Helping patients with their health each day to make them better."
good,"This company is great love the people great hours and definitely will work with your schedule. "
good,good place to work/ good co-workers /got along with everyone/           would recommend this place for patient on dialysis.just nice place to work at
good,"DaVita is a good company to work for. My current role in field operations has pluses and minuses. Pluses - team, able to work with really smart individuals in a collaborative environment. DaVita also invests heavily in professional development and retention through proper onboarding and annual meetings. Minuses - there are plenty of initiatives to roll out on a regular basis, and staffing last minute call-outs can be a challenge."
good,"While there were many pros such as very flexible hours, great pay and being exposed to many great people, I found myself just getting burnt out quickly due to the lack of consistency, one day was super busy and the next day was brutally slow."
good,"A typical day at DaVita is very tip toeing, they will let u go over any little thing. I really like driving for the company because there is no mirco-managing because you are driving and delivering. I like the other drivers but sometime not so trust worthy. My supervisor never really looked out for me much when really needed when I would get you get blamed for something so small. The company is very growing if your a nurse or higher position, but my overall experience has been very emotional because of all the sick dialysis patients I have come in contact with."
good,"As the Facility Administrator for Bayou City Dialysis I currently manage the day to day operations of the facility; ensuring the safe, therapeutic nursing management of the End State Renal Disease (ESRD) patients. Functioning as the facility CEO and being responsible for ensuring that the Governing Body enforces policies and procedures, is involved in ensuring patient bill of rights is fulfilled, and reviewing the overall functioning of the facility are a few of my main responsibilities."
good,"Put on catheter patients, administer all medications, dressings. Manage team of techs and work with team. Management always trying to squeeze you"
good,"Recruiter - Dealt with a lot of ambiguity with no real training. We had one week of here are three systems that don't work with any synergy. Figure it out. Famous quote - ""This is drinking from a fire hose."" "
good,"I learned leadership and team work, and I learned about co-workers. I learned how to not take things personal and start thinking about them being business."
good,plan to stay with company.   put patients first.   Team work environment. Hours were difficult at times. Management was very people friendly.
good,DaVita was great. My job introduced me to the field of Dialysis. The company promoted team work by having weekly team meetings and coaching. Training was provided on an ongoing basis to imporve productivity.
good,"Very great place to work.  Always meet your fulltime hours.  Just not the best kid/family friendly place to work.  I have learned how to cannulate patients, assess vitals, monitor patients as needed, access CVC sites, administer medications, administer injections, how to educate patients with patient education that may be needed by the patient, and I have also learned the role of how to train all new employees hired on by our facility.  Management has been great and they are wonderful and very open to teach you new things.  The co-workers are great, a pleasure to work with, I love being a leader and enjoy working with new people.  The hardest part of the job is trying not to get attached to my patients.   The most enjoyable part of my job is everything.  I love helping people and I love teaching people how to better learn their jobs."
good,"DaVita is a good place to work, with a strong culture of excellent patient care and corporate responsibility. I have recommended it to several prospective employees"
good,"I enjoyed working at Davita Dialysis Center for my externship. I thoroughly enjoyed working with the patients and their families. One thing I learned while being there was not to take life for granted. Many of the patients were very ill, but still managed to smile, laugh, and even joke while on dialysis. My co-workers were very supportive and welcoming while I was there. The hardest part of the job was learning of patients who passed. After building relationships with these people and knowing you will never see them again was hard."
good,Typical day at work consist of 8 - 15 hours shift. You learn different patient care and duties. All co-workers help each other so it's a friendly environment. Hardest part of the job is getting used to the patient vs. tech ratio witch is 4 - 1. Overall Davita is a great company!
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Start my workday before the crack of dawn, teammates talk and interact setting up for patients. As the day goes on we try to make the best of the patients day by doing games and making them feel comfortable during their treatment."
good,Can work 3 days with full time benefits as they have 15 hour shifts available. I worked 3 shifts in a row for 4 days off which was great for my kids having 4 days off. Early start times are about 515am though. Very busy on your feet running around during turnovers but in between you have time for documentation and catch up. If someone calls out you have more than the state maximum of 3 dialysis patient’s at a time
good,I enjoy being part of DaVitas mission and making an impact on patient lives. Only downside is the limited ability to vertically grow within the company unless you’re willing to relocate.
good,"Patient care is a necessity, unfortunately with budget cuts the clinic isn't always able to have the amount of employees or the allotted time needed to make sure that the employees aren't stretched too thin. But for the most part it truly is a great company to work for and the core values are above and beyond."
good,"Strong company culture"
good,"DaVita is predominately Filipino.  If you are of a different ethnicity, it’s easy to feel misunderstood or not accepted for your experience and skill."
good,"Compensation is decent only if they let you get all your hours, you get plenty of time off but because the schedule is so weird it doesnt leave the ability to get a second job to make up for the lack of hours, the insurance is terrible it doesn't really cover much of anything, teammates are very supportive of each other, there are a lot of cons but a lot of pros too."
good,This company could be great but there is alot  management. So things are micromanaged. As a nurse it's good move financially. They do encourage growth
good,"I was hired on before the new laboratory was built. The hours were long and the work was more manual but we had a good amount of rapport with management. I work nightshift now, I like who I work with and continue to look for opportunities to advance."
good,"Your experience at DaVita will depend entirely upon the lane you work in. While there is a strong sense of culture, and the culture emphasizes servant leadership, the organization is too large to ensure leadership is consistently enforcing the company values. Much of your quality-of-life at DaVita will be determined by your director, and in IT at least, there is little oversight at the director level. Some directors are true servant leaders and empower their teams while acting in accordance with the values, while others are more career-focused and play typical corporate games."
good,"loved my patients, coworkers and boss, good benefits and job culture was great ( dud company dinners and team outtings) one main negative was the staffing and hours. low staffing causing crazy hours (4am-5pm) crazy overtime and unsafe ratios"
good,"great team, amazing medical director, place had changed with new management, Learned a lot at the workplace. Allowed me to grow at the same facility. Willing to transfer."
good,It’s a great company It’s all what you make of it I met great people and they help out with what ever you need you also learn new things everyday and being able to help them patients mean the world to me I’m glad I chose Davita
good,The company has great mission and core values. The culture of DaVita is one that we have a team that treats each other as we would treat our paitents.
good,I LOVE their culture. The only reason I left is to move to Oklahoma for my husband's job. An extroverted personality like mine will do great there. I also felt extremely comfortable asking questions and submitting new ideas to make work tasks easier or to save time. I thrive when that is encouraged.
good,"I love my job and the work I do with patients. I have learned so much. The patients and my fellow teammates have been great. The doctors are amazing as well. It's a very rewarding job, we are these patients life lines and they count on us everyday to keep them alive. The job is extremely fast paced, on your feet all day. Initiating and terminating dialysis treatments. The best part of the job is seeing these patients live another day and/or getting a transplant. Hardest part of the job is not really being able to balance family/ life outside of the job, due to the job being so demanding. Not having a set schedule is hard."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Nice place to work. Work life balance is awesome. The Core Values are easy to apply to your everyday work life. The company believe in their teammates. It's a village.
good,Pay is on the lower scale for nurses. Management is ok depending on which clinic you work to. Benefits are really good. There is room for growth and advancement.
good,Has a unique corp culture.  Good company to work for. Has very good people there.  Was a fun atmosphere.  Always something different every day so it made the job fun.
good,DaVita is the place where it gave me an opportunity for the exposure to many technologies and different cultures which helped me in the overall development.
good,steady fast paced environment and stayed focused on getting job done all employees work were very helpful. Tasks were done on time. No one complained.
good,"The job was fine, but there were some challenges with getting adequate staffing. Upper management was supportive but the turnover rate was a bit high."
good,"group cohesion is fostered. the company tries to show the employees that they are valuable. HD treatment can be routine and hours long, but if you give the job 100%, you will always continue to grow and look forward to coming to work."
good,They have a very good culture that they try to promote.  They provide lots of training and direction which is very good.  Expectations are very high and demanding but can be very rewarding.
good,"It is an interesting place to work. You have to work long hours everyday. I worked 3 15-17 hour days per week and it is exhausting. The management seems to care, but just like most for profit companies they care about the bottom line more than the employees and patients. I accrued a lot of vacation that I couldn't take."
good,"Great company to work the the patient make your day !! "
good,Enjoyed Davita pros is flexible schedule health benefits 401k  free lunches cons over work staff never know time getting off raises isn’t that good...
good,"Very chaotic work environment and poorly managed. The facility"
good,Davita is great place to work offers alot of opportunities to its emplyees. To advance in traning in new job fields. Also have excellent benifits like health insurance 401k good traning programs to further your job skills thy also have one of the best emplyee support services to help you with from payroll to personal life changing events. They are always there for you ready to help you in any way also they have alkt of company benifits that they offer like company discounts slso they provide many family related grants and scholerships that not only team members can take advantage of but also thier family members adwell.overall davita has been one of the best health companies i have worked at.
good,"This is a  good company to work for... As long as you have the right leadership in place... If the head is not right than the body will not work. The hardest part of this job is being on your feet for hours on end.  The patients are precious, kind of hard not to get close to them.  These are people you almost see more than your own family."
good,"Local has difficulty following the guidelines of culture of national base.  I loved the education provided for leadership, the support provided by cooperate, very positive and forward thinking. The cons include very poor local support, lack of culture improvement recommendations."
good,DaVita dialysis is a good employer.  They seem to really invest in their teammates and allow teammates the opportunity for investment.  This position is as the manager and CEO of a dialysis facility.  This company really grows it's teammates and doesn't restrict based on degree or former job titles.
good,DaVita is a great company to work for. They have great advancement opportunities. They have flexible scheduling for staff. They have a great staff education program. They offer continuing education credits.
good,"I loved working for DaVita Rx, sadly my branch will be closing down soon. Given the opportunity I would work for DaVita again. The culture is fantastic and the compensation is higher than most comparable roles with other companies."
good,Upper level management does not offer very much support or lend an ear to listen. They provide great training and decent benefits and local management is great at our facility.
good,"Davita is a great company that provides training, flexible hours, compensation and a team atmosphere.  My work day could vary depending on equipment status and priorities."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"13 hours a day. have 4 patients every shift. you will have 3 shifts, teammates are nice and friendly. management is bad too much politics. patients are nice"
good,"Very busy fast passed environment, love the mission and core values.  The leadership team truly cares about all levels of the team and patients. I love being able to give life to our patients and the opportunities that DaVita has provided."
good,"A typical day at work is processing at least 70 to 90  claims per day  which includes senior and commercial claims. "
good,Loved the culture and people here. Met a lot of great coworkers that I will continue to keep in touch with. I had a great boss for a year before it closed down. Everyone here tried to make work more fun by having potlucks and ice cream events. Will miss everyone here.
good,Very flexible work scheduling. Going the extra mile to make the workplace fun and enjoyable. Frequent huddles to exchange ideas and to transmit information face-to-face. A lot of enjoyable activities to raise fund for Kidney Foundation
good,"DaVita Rx was a great place to work, but unfortunately, they are closing permanently soon.  The Orlando location will officially close its doors on October 26, 2018."
good,"For being a first internship, I truly learned a lot at this organization. This internship provided me with the unique opportunity to develop experience in both the healthcare and business related fields."
good,"Working at DaVita was a great experience. The support and love was  great amongst the workers. The management, could be better sometimes, however overall it was delayed with communication."
good,The job is great but not a good long term job. Nice coworkers and pretty good company activities. Management could be better. Overall an ok place to work
good,"This environment is fast paced and you learn to think on your feet.  Great benefits but not worth the stress in the end.  Going in with experience is a plus but extremely difficult as a new grad.  After 12 weeks your training is over and if you dont make the cut, they let you loose."
good,Opportunity for advancement and fun culture. There is a lot of incentive to give back to the community and take care of patients. Leadership strives to help you learn and grow.
good,"A good place to work and obtain growth and advancement .  The company offers great incentives! tuition reimbursement, travel and continuous education."
good,Fun and fulfilling.  Great place to work!  Great training.  Good teammates to work with.  Everyone is very helpful.  Acclimated well.  Developed a good working rapport.
good,Davita tries to instill family life and work life balance.  They have a University where you get to attend and gives you an idea of who you are and why you belong where you're at.
good,"Extremely rewarding to see the work you do every day improving, sustaining and sometimes saving the lives of patients you know by name and care for.  No better reason to go to work every day than this."
good,"very fast paced job, stressful at times, very long hours on your feet the majority of time, team mates help when needed when other team mates needs assistance."
good,"Adequate staffing has been an issue, but the existing staff works out the day to stay safe and effective. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping patients deal with any physical, mental, domestic, and financial issues they are faced.  I also enjoy working with the best staff I've ever worked with in my entire hemodialysis career.   Like any nursing job, working as a hemodialysis RN is stressful and taxing on you physically and mentally.   If you are interested in training to become a hemodialysis RN, this is the place to start."
good,"I was a patient care manager with Davita. I enjoyed the people I worked with,  however, I did not find the work challenging enough. It was a new role at the hospital we were stationed at and we did not have sufficient support for the non clinical parts of the job. Davita is a great organization to work for. Great benefits and the company culture is very inclusive."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Not much room for error, punishment meted out swiftly for infractions or judgement errors under stress. I would not recommend this job. Corporate culture weird, with a 'take-over the world of healthcare' type of vision, with  less an emphasis on the dialysis component alone as being of value. Most of upper management with non-nursing backgrounds which was frustrating when trying to explain clinical issues with treatment."
good,"Chronic renal care is a fast passed environment, You are on ur feet for 10 hours straight. Constantly on the go, very busy. My manager was great to work for. She always tried to work with your schedule and wasn't scared to get on the floor and help with the patients"
good,"DaVita has a magnificent work environment for the HQ teammates."
good,"A fast pace working environment, you should take notes on everything they teach you at times you will need those notes. Although i like this job i want to advance and grow with a company i don't feel davita has that to offer that to me."
good,"This is a great place to work. However, the pay isn't great and the hours are early and long. But you get used to it. The patients are friendly and the managers are great. We do seven on and seven off but the first four days are for recouping the rest you lost, and the last three are preparing for the seven coming back up. If you don't mind working long hours, dealing with blood or needles, and getting up early, this is the perfect job for you."
good,"Learning to operate the dialysis machines was challenging because of the difficulty and somewhat scary because a small mistake could make a big problem for a patient's immediate wellbeing. Keeping up the fast pace all day was difficult, but if you succeeded, it was a great day!"
good,Many opportunities. Awesome work environment. pay could be better. good benefits. lots of flexibility in work hours. enjoyed my team. lots of critical thinking involved making for interesting days.
good,DaVita has a wonderful culture established.  They work well with staff to give them the support and education they need in-order to be better educators for our patients.  The work life balance is not always easy to maintain they do provide you with tools and education on work life balance.  The most enjoyable part of DaVita was working with the patients and being able to give them some of their life back instead of dialysis in a center to be able to give them the ability to do this at home on their time rather than the available hours in the centers was a wonderful gift .
good,A typical day at Davita is fun because of the teammates.  The workload somedays was a bit stressful but not the entire day. The hardest part of the job was if the systems go down or the IT department took a long time to give a resolution on a account. The most enjoyable part of the job was the company events. They really cared about the employees.
good,A typical day at work is filled with fum and team efforts. I learnt team building and interpersonal leadership skills through training and guidance from great leaders.
good,"Davita is a fun filled environment with amazing coworkers. There is always something to learn from both supervisors and patients themselves. I love building relationships with our patients and helping them in any way that I can."
good,Almost too busy at times. Ned to keep a sharp eye on YOUR patients and OTHERS. Too much can happen in a short amt of time and go south very quickly. Inservices are almost always enjoyed with food!
good,Good place to work. They offer good actives and programs for the employees to grow and learn. I would like to work there at a nurse once I am finish with school.
good,"This company was a decent place to start off as a CNA-Dialysis Technician.  What I liked the most is the company was willing to teach new employees, and not already seek out only those with experience.  Overall my work experience was positive, and I would say this company is a good place to start as a person who wants to get into the medical field, but would like to work in a clinic base setting."
good,"Während meines dualen Studiums wurde ich in viele Dialysetypische Arbeitsschritte eingewiesen. Zu diesen zählten das Patientenmanagement, das Qualitätsmanagement, die Abrechnung und ähnliches. "
good,DaVita is a fun place to work and there are always team building events with in departments. The culture is very different compared to other companies.
good,Dialysis treatment is hard work taking care for 4-6 patients at once. You have to be a very strong person to keep up with the patient care. Its all worth it you get to know the patients. That's the best thing about Dialysis.
good,"I learned a lot from this experience but the driving to different hospitals is stressful. If someone wants to work a lot this is the place to go, they will always ask you to do extra work if you are good at what you do and don't mind going to different hospitals. The doctors are usually easy to deal with and they are speciifc as to what one needs to do."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Over time management level did not hold employees accountable for their responsibilities and disorganization followed.  A typical work week contained lots of flexibility relative to schedule.
good,"Its a good company to work for they will train people "
good,DaVita is a great place to work though the health plans could be cheaper and contain more in network providers. I have always enjoyed my job and the opportunities to grow in your career are numerous.
good,"This was a learning branch that I used to explore into other nursing jobs beside being a Nurse. I moved this job, great schedules, people & work environment."
good,It was enlightening and something new everyday. Patients was the most enjoyable part of everything. Overall it was a pleasure to work for the company.
good,"Good place to start as a nurse, patients are great as you get to know them. If you're a person who don't care about waking up early the days you work, this place you're gonna love."
good,DaVita is a great place to work. Their outlook on patient care is amazing. There is always opportunity for bonuses and incentives. I really loved working for DaVita.
good,"working with patients to help them live longer and as average as possible with ESRD."
good,I loved my job at DaVita. The only thing I didn't like was you had to pick up where people failed and you were expected of that while the person failing never had to do their job correctly.
good,"I was new to dialysis,and have been with the company for 6 months now. Its a great trade to learn if you are already in the healthcare feild, but if not it may scare someone off. But My clinic has made me think about quiting, due to the disorganized management team. We are currently with out a permanent FA, and the standing one is never there,responds to your texts when she feels like it, the CC on most times doesn't make sure the floor is covered when someone takes a pto day. They have two pt. coming in at the same time in the same bay which is very nerve racking and throws you off track. I have considered transferring to another clinic, but that would mean me having to tell the GM why i want to which would require me throwing a few people under the bus. I work the night shift which at my clinic is MWF 5p to 4a. The hours don't bother me and the pay and benefits are very good. I wont give up on the company as a whole and maybe i just need to transfer to another clinic, and if i see the same thing then i will know that Davita does not stand by its core values. for now i am at a fork in the road as to if i will stay with this company."
good,"Company embraces the ""team"" work mentality.  Enjoyed working with patients and staff.  Patient care is the highest priority. Learned how to maintain patient records, worked with physicians, insurance agencies and support services to maintain continuous patient care. I really enjoyed helping patients and assisting the facility director with making sure the clinic was organized, efficient place to work."
good,"great mission and value, reminded and lived daily"
good,The company has a really great culture in its corporate culture but it does not translate well to the field and local operations. My role has provided a great work life balance but many of my field teammates voice how overworked they are. I have found it very difficult to move up in the company and the 1% raise each year does not keep up with inflation. Several of my teammates and myself have had a hard time moving up or seeing a pay increase. Seems easier to leave the company if you want more opportunities.
good,I have a degree in Chemistry and the technicalities of dialysis line up well with my background.  I often felt that safety was compromised due to understaffing.
good,"Given autonomy, with heavy workload, travel required in most positions, progressive company, strong future., flexibility in schedule as long as business needs are met,"
good,"Very flexible schedule, training opportunities, depending on clinic and FA, could have good independence as well. "
good,"Great place to work! Learned a lot, worked with great, dependable people.  Hours were long, but caring for people is very satisfying.  I would recommend this place to others."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,I like this job especially if you have an awesome team. I work have worked in a couple of different buildings and there's always room for overtime. There's a davita on every corner.
good,"Working in the hospital services group can be challenging mostly because of the irregular treatment hours and unpredictable patient volumes - sometimes it's busy, sometimes census is low.  Working for DaVita teaches you to be flexible and ""roll with the punches"" as you don't know what you'll get.  The hardest part of the job is when you get simultaneous requests for machine repairs; the best part is when you see treatments getting done and patients feeling better."
good,"DaVita is a great place to work if you can find a team and manager that fits your needs. As with any large company, there are a variety of experiences here. However, if you find a department or team that doesn't fit what you need, they do support transition if you are a hard worker."
good,"At first it seems like an amazing position where you are going to help chronically ill individuals to have a lifeline. In reality, dialysis patients suffer from many ailments day in and day out, have to follow strict diets, and have to receive hours long treatments 3 x weekly that has many uncomfortable and at times painful aspects. It is a heart wrenching thing for sensitive individuals and the patients aren't happy folks. As well, Davita is a corporation and in true corporate work ideals, create a stressful time vs work load environment."
good,"Working for DAVITA is a good environment specially teammates we see each other sometimes more than we see our family but we always manage to balance it out. Working with patients , same patients every other day is like family gathering at work. I like to make people laugh to get their mind out of their illness. There are times our clinic gets really busy but our patients are very good and patience about it."
good,Davita is a good company to work for however management was not very effective. My manager did not believe in holding other staff members accountable. I did not enjoy the early waking hours or the inconsistent job hours.
good,"monitoring caring for patient during their treatments, teaching on medications, diet, fluid restrictions, monitoring labs and contact MD when necessary"
good,A happy place because all the patients were happy at the end of their treatment. I learnt that kidney failure is slowly killing our population
good,"Davita is a great place so start an hemodialysis employment oppurnity.    They believe in a teaching environment, but they should be just as critical of those that do not practice what they are taught."
good,"Davita is a great company to work for. Dealing with different types of patients was challenging and enjoyable. However, the employees are not informed of a state mandated test that occurs at the end of your 90 days, so that leaves the employee shocked and unprepared. They have a low passing rate for their students due to the miscommunication. However the office staff did fight for my employment and re-training after failing the test. Corporate office would not allow me to re-apply until after 90 days."
good,This company lives up to their mission statement and they truly do care about their employees.  My only dislike was too many management changes in a 18 month period.  Now things are much better.
good,"fast paced and sometimes stressful environment. Long hours.You either hate this job or love it. It takes a year min. to feel comfortable. I love it, just don't like how management is going now"
good,"I had 3 years of experience under Davita Management. Depending on Clinical Mgmt  team building is great! 401k shares are matching, benefits are fine"
good,It a really good company to work for. They care about there employees and put effort into trying to show they care.  Dialysis is important to Davita and the way they do it!
good,No two days are alike.  Fast paced environment.  Great co-workers.  Always an opportunity for presenting ways of doing something more efficient and better.  Community Involvement.  Company celebrations.  Must be self motivated and go beyond expectations.
good,"I was on call for a local Conway Hospital and did not have much contact with Davita chronic units or management.  Davita had a contract with the hospital.    In the position I held, I worked independently for the most part.  It seemed that as long as there were no complaints about me (there weren't), that I did not hear from Davita.  I had already done this job when Central Arkansas Dialysis held the contract and was acquired by Davita when the contract went to them.  The Doctor would call me each day to let me know which patients needed hemodialysis.  I would go to the hospital and prepare the machine, solutions, and materials to go and do the treatments ordered.  IT was one on one care in the patients room for the duration of the treatment.  Davita payed my check, provided the equipment, answered my questions, and offered education opportunities.  I do not know what it would be like to work in a regular Davita chronic unit, but have no complaints about how they treated me in my setting."
good,"Work day includes setting up new patients, setting up travel, and answering general questions and/or concerns for the patients."
good,Fun and productive place to work. Very nice co-workers. I had on the job training to put patient on dialysis machines. I was very rewarding to know that I can help maintain someone's life.
good,"Strong attempts to make the entire organization feel connected. There are many ways to learn more about the company you work for. The hardest part of the job is the feeling that you are never done, the amount of work responsibility is high with limited resources. The most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling that you belong to something really big and that what you do is important and necessary for the success of the whole."
good,This was a great place to work.  The facility admin was amazing and caring. They offered easy scheduling and flexible hours.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Davita RX is a great place to work.  The culture comes off as quite corny and a little childish at first, but the reality of what you're dealing with, terminal patients, calls for a lighthearted vibe.  Management is good, for the most part, even if favorites are played (as with all jobs), and who you know can matter much more than what you do.  Pay is decent to good, and the benefits and time off are nice.  The company changed over the two years I was there from a warm, family vibe to a much colder, ""we are a business"" vibe, which is understandable, as the company has grown quite quickly. Overall, a good place to work, but in recent months, they have gotten quite rigid and unreasonable in their expectations of their employees, especially in the customer service department."
good,DaVita Healthcare Partners inc.is a company that truly stands behind it's Core Values and regularly recognizes teammates who are going above and beyond in these areas. There are opportunities to move within the company to allow for growth and advancement.  DaVita cares for it's community as it cares it's patients and teammates with many opportunities to serve each of these groups.
good,"The staff members at DaVita were exceptional. Technicians were very knowledgeable and helpful to me, a new RN in the field. Management personnel were easily accessible and willing to work with RNs and PCTs on any subject. This job kept me busy every day, which I loved. The hardest part of the job was fielding several problems at once, such as one patient having low BP problems, another with a clotted CVC, doctors trying to talk to me about new orders,  and problems with the schedule. I learned to triage the situations and handle it. I loved talking with the patients. That was the most enjoyable part. They have wonderful stories to tell, and sometimes it is possible to find out new, pertinent information like a medication change, or something in their diet that needs to be discussed, and bringing is the RD or MSW if they are needed. I learned so much I the time I was there. I have tried to list these in my resume. They adhere to the core values and principles of the company."
good,"I work mainly alone with very little supervision."
good,"As the company is growing rapidly, they are having to make changes continuously. Current changes are not meeting my needs. Overall, they treat their employees well."
good,"Its a hard job,but it can be rewarding working with the right people,Most of the people I work with are wondefful.the hardest part of the job is watching patients die that you have gotten attached to."
good,DaVita is multi cultural I loved it. I learned a lot about how to deal with conflict and I learned a lot about myself. Management was ok in some clinics. My manager I had when I first started was very professional and I learned a lot from her. The hardest part of the job was the 15 to 18 hour days when others would call in.
good,Fun place to work while people work very hard.  Moral is very good at this company and everyone supports the Core values of the company.
good,"I love working at DaVita! I need an office or AA position to stabilize my hours, otherwise I wouldn't leave. Ever! Teammates and management are great. Everyone believes in working together. DaVita always looks for reasons to celebrate!"
good,Overall good place to work loved my teammates. Long hours would go back to work here. Just  need to get home life together.
good,"One for All, and All for One!  We work together, sharing a common purpose, a common culture and common goals.  We genuinely care for and support, not only those to whom we provide care, but those with whom we work shoulder-to-shoulder. We work together to pursue achieving our Mission."
good,great place to work  and great people. fun enviorment to be in so it make work easier and time pass by faster. lots of room for advancement in the company
good,"A typical day at work starts with the preparation. The process of testing , and running the machines for any issues can take up to 25 minutes. This process is done and completed before each patient is engaged onto the machine. Each of our co workers work together as a team. I have learned completely the ins and outs of the dialysis world. The patients reaction when I can make their day is what is the greatest part to my job. hardest part of the job is making fast decisions on heath basics."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working for DaVita Healthcare Partners, Inc.  I currently serve as a supervisor and advancement in my division is limited, so I'm looking for opportunities to work in an office or location rather than remote from my team if possible."
good,"This is a wonderful place to work. The culture is very conducive for young professionals looking to begin there career and develop their skills. Management is accessible and willing to assist you with you goals and development. All of my teammates are friendly and helpful and genuinely have you best interest at heart. I love the fact of being able to assist in giving someone a better quality of life, and find i frustrating when there are factors that do not allow me to assist the teammate in a timely and efficient manner."
good,"Awsome company to work for, the only downfall is the work/life balance is not a priority for the position I held and dificult to move up in company."
good,"Managed a team of 25 individuals to include RN, PCT, RD, SW, administrative assistants, Reuse technician and Biomed. Ensured that our patients were well cared for ensuring that all State and Federal guidelines were being met. "
good,Thoroughly enjoyed my 6+ years at DaVita.  Leadership is very involved in day to day operations and I the overall care that the patients receive.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"The most enjoyable thing about my day is being able to render help and care to those who are most appreciative, and to those who are not.  I love what I do, it is a blessing to be able to do something I am passionate about and at the same time make someone feel better."
good,"Hospital dialysis doesn't lend itself to really typical days. This company encouraged teamwork and a feeling of belonging. Scheduled work days could vary from no work to 5, 10, even 18+ hour days, depending on patient population. Management didn't seem to listen to the workers concerns or suggestions. My co-workers were all hard working and, for the most part, willing to help each other out on days we were especially busy. The hardest part was the scheduling and keeping the shifts covered properly. The most enjoyable part of this job was watching the patients respond to treatment and get better. I also enjoyed doing patient teaching and helping the patient understand their disease process and how to improve their wellness."
good,The people I work with are the greatest team anyone could possibly ask for and the expectations for performance are even higher. If you're going to work at DaVita make sure it's doing something you enjoy because otherwise it will suck the life out of you.
good,"great experience"
good,"DaVita is a fantastic company! The San Diego Region didn't really hold up their end of the bargain (at least until 2009). Although some of the management team were amazing and wonderful, their was an overwhelming sense of clique-iness based on culture. The hiring process was based on nepotism and if you weren't in the club you were a target for exile and knew it!"
good,Fresenius is place where you can grow and receive great training
good,"Man, was this a hard job, but fun place to work!  DaVita knows how to treat their employees and did a great job-only problem is they did not give the FA as much respect as they deserved.  Excellent compensation, but you do work for every penny!"
good,"Outstanding Culture. The training was amazing, and value to employee was awesome."
good,"Typical Day: Set up dialysis machines, checking patients in, hooking patients up to machines, charting, and cleaning. "
good,"days are long, but you are working with a great team. Management is on hands and values the team."
good,Its a great place to work good learning environment great management.
good,"The typical day is very busy. I have learned how to initiate and discontinue hemodialysis patients. QAPI, Budget, Regulatory compliance, IDT meetings"
good,"supported other users"
good,"Davita is a good place to work. Each Facility Administrator keeps the company mission statement and core values as a guide to operate his or her facility. Taking care of our patients is like taking care of a family member. The co-workers including myself work as a team. "
good,"A typical day at work would be to initiate treatments, terminate treatments, monitor patients, I learned to work with a team, hardest part of the job it could be very stressful."
good,"I work in the World Head Quarters located in downtown Denver, it is one of the most beautiful buildings walking into.  This just reminds me every morning how blessed I am to work for such a great ""company"".  I work on my own book of business and manage my own shift and work load.  The team that I work for has great leadership and outstanding teammates.  I think the most difficult thing about this job is just keeping up on all of the changes that go on with Medicare and in Kidney Dialysis.  With that being said I also really enjoy how it keeps me on my toes."
good,Very demanding but rewarding workplace. Overall great place to work.
good,"Informative staff. Eager to teach employees, learned and experienced great things"
good,"Bad schedule work,horrible managment on that time,some team work,the good part was be off on sundays."
good,The Work here is difficulty one can expect a long work day 12-14 hour shifts.  Difficulty work life balance.  The most enjoyable part is when you can see a patient get a kidney transplant or regain function.  That makes it worth while.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"As a company, Davita is great! Good bonuses, fun coworkers. Chronically short staffed though, very difficult to take time off. Long hours. Great providers."
good,"A day at Davita is stressful but also fun. I have learned what its like to be a team player, promotting health and fittness all while having a good time at work. My management team is wonderful as well as my co-worker. The hardest part of my job is losing my beloved patients, but the most enjoyable part of the job is the family,here at Davita we are all considered family."
good,Good place to work unfortunately there’s no advancement I learn a lot trough this company helping patients everyday by making sure medication was on time we had one of the best management but he took another role and ever since things just went downhill lack of communication. People that I worked around were amazing toughest thing for us was the systems always had problems making it hard for us to get off on time.
good,The most enjoyable part is serving the clients with dignity and respect.
good,"Long hours, as many as 18 in a shift. Very physically demanding. manage all types of disease processes. The worst part is working with others that are not always reliable. The management is constantly calling to cover open shifts. The job is mentally and physically demanding. The patients are wonderful, you know that you are saving lives with each treatment."
good,"The hardest part of the job was there wasn't much room for work / life balance. My supervisor lived in a different state, so communication was sometime difficult. This job taught me the importance of time management"
good,DaVita is a very good place to work. The working hours are not family friendly. The hours are set and strict. The working hours make it very hard to find harmony with your family life if you have children.
good,"It was the best place for my first career after being a Stay at Home mom for the early part of my adult life.  Continuous Improvement, and Patient Care is top notch, and allows for innovation."
good,"DaVita Rx was a pretty good organization.  They cared deeply for their patients and teammates.  I loved waking up in the morning just to get to the office.  My managers I supported were phenomenal.  It really matter when you were blessed with such wonderful, caring managers/teams."
good,The company  has multiple clinics in the area. Working with different people helps me learn about myself. Davita gives good medical and dental insurance. Other bendfits are also offered. The company is good.
good,"Davita overall for me, was a great company to work for and advance myself and my career ambitions.  My primary outpatient center was a good location that I would gladly receive treatment at myself or with a loved one.  However, it was very evident that it was not always the case depending upon where your primary center was.  The center I was trained in had a very punitive culture and unjust individuals who would personally threaten you if you challenged their perceived authority in any manner.  And while bad eggs exist in any environment, I know that person continued to work there long after I was leaving and felt it safe to finally speak of my experience to my manager.  I could also regal multiple episodes of individual stories from other centers with horrid experiences ranging from wretched environments, to outright unsafe practices.  "
good,Very good company to work for i would love to return back as an employee. Good training good team to work with always room for advancement. Health benefits are good as well
good,"Very rewarding.  Excellent opportunities for advancing within the company"
good,Very interesting company to work for but the pay is a little low for talented people. You have to prove yourself before they recognize you. But all in all the company is exciting to be with.
good,"The hardest part of the Facility Administrator position is maintaining work-life balance with staffing challenges (call-outs/turnover)."
good,Great place to work if your motivated and hard working. Great benefits and opportunities for advancement. Usually you would work 3 days a week 12 hours a day.
good,"A typical day at the office was defined by emails, on-going calls, reports and adhering to patient and staff concerns or needs. Learned how to manage inventory budget, how to prepare for a state inspection, manage patients medications, compliances with policy and procedures and informed consent for patients. The culture was a place where everyone embraced the core values of Davita and truly worked for patient care. Staff always came together in an event of an emergency. The hardest part of the job is losing patients and accepting death, or attempting to work as a team for better patient outcomes or complex social difficulties that cause barriers and prove to be damaging. The most enjoyable is working together as a team for the same purpose and making patients happy."
good,"Excellent company when I started but things are changing and not all for the better. Need to pay more, still not quite competitive, need to revamp their PTO policy (you get a little more PTO but no paid holidays, you use your PTO for holidays). Management is overworked, and it’s creeping downward. "
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,It has changed at davita in the past 6 years. It is a busy and growing place. Rules and job duties change a lot to try to make a better work environment. I hardest part of my job has always been losing patients. I am with them three days a weeks and get really close to them. I come to work caring for my patients and wanting the best for them in there life.
good,I love the field of dialysis and I actually like DaVita as a company. The managers at the facility where I worked and am back working just don’t have any type of backbone. This manager that I am currently working for and have worked for in the past was super instrumental in hiring me back but she just isn’t a good manager. We’re always short staffed and that puts a strain on us girls. Myself and another teammate have dealt with this for years and we just deal with it.
good,"DaVita was an awesome place to work and the Morale was awesome! What I did appreciate about DaVita. They had dynamic training methods for future and Current employees. When it came to EHR systems, trends, patient care etc. I must add that the flexibility was great! However,  as an employee you’re accountable for many things you are assigned too. The pay scale is very low for the  amount of work you are assigned too. But, itit was a great place to work. I was there for 5 years"
good,"I really enjoyed DaVita, it is a fun yet challenging place to work at. Everyone strives to better themselves and everyone is helpful to one another. Work wise, I was in the call center, being able to assist patients over the phone gave me a sense of accomplishment. Going to work was fun."
good,"DaVita Overall good company to work for, they could pay a little more, however I enjoy working 3 days a week and still being considered full time. (32 plus hours)"
good,this job is amazing I loved caring for my patients the job its self. I learned a lot of new things with this job . the hardest part of this job are the hours waking up at 2 tp 3 am with kids is not ideal.
good,"The hardest part of the job is understanding the full functions of Dialysis and how the kidneys work. Making sure that all your patients are stable enough to run their Treatment. Monitor the patients  fluid retention check vitals,blood pressure.But the joy of it all it that your their giving care and treatment to people who depends on Dialysis to help them with their everyday lives"
good,A good place to work. Good work life balance. Good compensation benefits. Job security okay. Management okay. Job culture is good. Fun activities are promoted.
good,"My experience at Davita was bitter sweet. It was great helping patients in need, some of the staff and management created a negative environment however. We were constantly short, and that's no same for us or the patients. It seemed like patients were stbthe bottom of our concerns. It was more about quantity of people versus the quality."
good,Usual ups and downs.  Less pay than other big medical groups which should hopefully improve shortly.  Pretty good benefits and good PTO.  Many nice people work here.  Harsh people won’t be abided which is good.
good,"DaVita was a great place to work.  I would go in and have a work que with patients that I had call and verify insurance, set it in our system and work any registration denials. worklists, etc that came into my que.  As a lead, I was a go to for teammates needing help and trained new teammates as they came in.  We had to make sure coverage was set correctly (ESRD has many government rules we have to follow) so claims would pay.  At the end of them, we worked long days to assure all patients were in the system for the close(charge import).  I loved helping teammates, working with the field (dialysis units) and working with the patients to clarify their issues."
good,"Very happy with most aspects of my employment at davita.  Although management needs to work on staffing, eductaions ,and retention though. Overall positive, just need to keep looking forward and develop long term employee retention and development"
good,Assisting patients with there healthcare is an important aspect of the job. I've learned the this is the area that fits me comfortably even with the hustle and bustle of caring for the patient effectively.
good,"I've learned alot about dialysis and several subsects. The management varied upon location and modality. Lots of perks and freebies. I sincerely believe that the company does want great outcomes for patients, and family."
good,I enjoyed my teammates we were like family. We were there for each other. Home away from home.  We were the model facility of Davita.  I enjoyed my work before I got sick and resigned because of circumstances. Davita is a fun loving respected place to work.
good,I worked for DaVita RX in a pharmacy. I was the Equipment technician. Nothing bad to say. I work with the pharmacist in a locked room. I learned a lot about PV1 and PV2 operations
good,Seriously provides good and safe patient care. TeammTes are regularly educated and practices with the newest up to date supplies and equipment.  Having  fun is a core value.
good,"I will miss this place. I have a lot of memories here at Davita Rx. The people I worked with were amazing! We rocked it out until the end. One for All, All for one!"
good,"My typical day starts with checking emails and doing audits on my teams' work and projects. I enjoy the culture, but there's limited advancement. However, I do enjoy the self autonomy."
good,"A typical Work day is  Machine and water System Repair and Maintenance. I have learned a lot within this company, For example I have learned how to train other teammates with different learning styles. Workplace culture is amazing and management always looking out for the teammate. It pains me to ever have to leave the company. I really cant say there is a hard part to the job as it is laid out perfect for work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to Give a person quality in life since they are usually suffering from kidney Failure."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,enjoyed working here. very flexible. opportunity for career building. solid work-life balance. Encouraged advancing education for employees. Great mission.
good,"Great place to learn and get into medical field if you have zero medical experience.  Opportunity to be able to learn so many things in medical industry and get paid for it even when you are in training or classes. "
good,DaVita offers training and opportunities for advancement. Promotes team work and management has an open door policy. I have enjoyed my time at Davita and would recommend this company to others.
good,"This company offers very flexible hours and an incredible culture, however, the turnover is high as there is not a clear advancement in career paths or room for growth other than working at the company for years and years."
good,"DaVita is a one of a kind employer and health care provider. No two days are the same and no two departments run exactly the same way. This has its pros and cons. Find the right department, team and/or leader and you will have a great DaVita experience!"
good,"davit is cool place to work, you learn a lot from the people, you become close nit working with the same individual. my bosses were nice and the patients friendly."
good,"there was no permanent position offered for this job as we were all told when we started working for davita through Brooksource staffing"
good,Staff good to work with. Employees all help each other. Everyone knows their jobs well and are willing to help any new employee. Management is caring.
good,"Davita is a great company that takes pride in the core values. They function as a community. "
good,"Depending on how big the facility is, the work environment can be fast paced. The is plenty room for advancement with this company. The hardest part of the job is loosing patients."
good,Its an ok place to work. The pay is great the work hours are murder. If you have small kids i wouldnt recommend you to work for this company unless you have a spouse or some type of support system.
good,I am learning a lot about dialysis and how it work. my co-workers are great to work with. We have a lot of team work and we are always helping one another
good,Great learning experience. Very fast pace environment. Shift turnover can be pretty intense at times. Great benefits. Just do your job and don't get caught up in the drama.
good,"It was surely fast pace, can be stressful at times. But with a good team in the clinic, we all helped each other. Patients can be grumpy (they are sick, understandable) they can say mean things, must have thick skin. But they are some patients you get attached and enjoy seeing them. I did enjoy my time working there, overtime is easy to pick up and paid days off racked up pretty fast. A 13 hour shift can feel super fast, had more good days than bad days."
good,"collaborative teamwork, quality service, flexible time, fun to work with different kinds of people, value for the employees, additional incentives for extra day shifts"
good,I absolutely loved this company! The culture was great and teh work was fulfilling. The only reason I left was because there was no growth and the pay for the job wasn't competitive.
good,No advancement opportunities for LVN in the Peritoneal Dialysis Dept. Loved working with the patients. Staff was great. Drive from Burleson Tx. was long.
good,"Every day is a learning experience and rewarding, being able to interact and assist every person that walks on the clinic floor.  Enjoy being able to listen to people talk about how thankful they are for the care thats given to them by our staff and even those that aren't happy helps me look at what I can do better to assist with their care."
good,I had my doubts before joining DaVita but 3 years later and I still LOVE the culture. Dialysis is a tough job and is not for everyone but DaVita does a great job of making it rewarding. Tuition reimbursement is great and lots of room to advance if you take the time to look at internal positions posted and talk with your manager about what areas you want to grow.
good,"luego de 1 y media hora de conducir hasta el trabajo, puedes desayunar si tienes tiempo o lo haces luego, se trabaja duro, bajo presión de tiempo y de trabajo, pero cuento con la colaboración de otros colegas y del supervisor, contamos con horario de desayuno, merienda, almuerzo y comida. generalmente se trabaja mas de 12 horas al día."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,I love what the company stands for. It's easy to advance and they provide a lot of educational opportunities for those that are interested. IT'S GREAT!
good,Culture Environment and Great work place. Pay was great some times stressful but overall very professional place to work at. The most enjoyable part of my job were the people.
good,"nice place to work, but a very busy place, you need to be fast and accurate here, otherwise you cannot go home on time after your shift. Make sure if you work here you really need to eat good before your shift, working here is non stop, but good people, good patients."
good,"Due to our integration from the acquisition May 1st, 2017 we were trusted to do our jobs. We did report every week our progress and help our teammates when needed. I verified insurance and entered new patients into the system so that the rest of my department could bill insurance for the services provided at our clinics. I had to pay attention to detail and be accurate. I also had to provide customer service for my office teammates as well as my teammates in the clinics and our patients. I enjoyed the contact with the clinics and to work at providing the best care possible for our patients."
good,Working as a Davita Biomedical Technician can be challenging.  There are many roads you have to travel in a day or a week.  You can start your day at one location and visit 2 to 3 more the same day.  It can be a rewarding job as there are multiple tasks that need completion as well as working with different personalities that can sometimes clash.
good,"A typical day at work for me is starting at 6:30am and working most days until 3:00 pm. The AP department has a new validation system so we have been on mandatory OT for the last 7 months but I enjoy what I do so that makes it easy to work long hours."
good,Typical day at work was very stressful. Time management was the key. Always felt rushed to care for the patient. I don't feel like the quality of care was geared towards the patient.
good,"The pay rate was good and the people, for the most part, were friendly and helpful.  Nice campus and comfortable office space.  Management could use some work in objectivity but that was specific to the dept I was working in.  Overall the place has a cult-like atmosphere (we live for each other and our patients) but if you stick it out, the place can be rewarding."
good,"Working for DaVita has been an extraordinary experience. The team is committed to their core values and treating patients and teammates with respect, professionalism, etc. Everyone is very nice and lots of feedback is given for continuous improvement in each role."
good,Enjoyed working here. The coworkers and the patients were always a  joy to work with and I loved knowing I was helping patients sick and in pain. Also was able to learn  lot in my time there.
good,Loved my time with DaVita! Would definitely recommend this position. So much to learn and so many opportunities. Management is great and will help you reach your goals.
good,"My job as a clinical Nurse Manager at Davita is very fulfilling to me. Every day I help patients whether if it is on the floor or back end helping them with other needs."
good,Needs better management.  The patients are wonderful and so is the staff. They just need to provide more training for their management. But overall its an ok company.
good,"the job on a daily basis is pretty busy,  many things to accomplish at times with not enough time... time management is very important and it can be done if there is team work."
good,"Im with the company for 10 year,12 hours shift its a diverse company ,Both of my FA are fair one of the reason why our retention rate are the highest among the region. Davita don't offer any Retirement or 401 K Matching."
good,"Worked with physicians to find opportunities for growth in areas of need. Built and acquired dialysis clinics."
good,i loved making a difference in the lives of the patients I was responsible for. complete joy to see patients feeling and looking better after their daily dialysis treatment.
good,"DaVita as a company is an excellent company to work for.  A typical day at DaVita included making sure all equipment was operational, so other teammates could give life to patients.  It was very satisfying to know I was a part of the process to ensure all patients were taking care of."
good,A lot of caring people work here taking great care of patients. Dialysis is a difficult area to work in but DaVita does it well. Fast paced and constantly changing.
good,"Ok place to work. Very high turnover, had three bosses in a year,. The company has a great culture and is very flexible with scheduling and understanding."
good,"Working at Davita  was a very stressful but rewarding experience."
good,"I love working for Davita, I do, my supervisor is amazing and I am so thankful for my team.  The hardest part of the job is being responsible for other people's actions and having to answer for them.  The most enjoyable part is the people you work with and helping the patients."
good,"I attended DaVita for my internship for school, i had a lot of hands on experience working with patients, it was nice to get to know them and hear their stories. The employees were very nice and helpful."
good,Love my job. Patient first. Focus on quality not quantity. Team is one of the core values and teammates are considered when important decisions need to be made that would impact the team.
good,"A lot of work which I don't  mind but the pay rate that was offer to me was too low for the amount of work needed to be done, again I didn't mind it at all, I love working."
good,Working here has allowed me come up with creative ways to interact with the patients and encourage them to achieve small victories like controling their fluid gains between treatments or taking their binders during meals etc. working 10-12 hour shifts can be draining but it allows you as a tech get exposure on cannulating all the patients AVF or AVG. It teaches you how to effectively manage your time.
good,"DaVita is dedicated to the proper care of patients.  The workplace and efforts are clear evidence."
good,"DaVita is a company that has a very different culture than most companies. It strongly follows it's core values and really instills the focus on equality and teamwork. The executive team is great and leads by example, which allows others to better respect and mirror their actions. "
good,"Working for this company was a great experience. I loved my job, just desired more structure and order in a work place. Not just when those of higher corporate authority are in the building but at ALL times."
good,Very fun company to work for. The have a lot of great position in the company so there diffidently room to move up and get promotion. I would recommend to any looking
good,"I worked for Davita for 14 years they helped to go to school and my promotions were well deserved and recognized. I enjoyed working there, there were hard days but fulfilling."
good,"I worked for this company for two years and never had an issue with coworkers. I was in charged off patient care this includes patient blood work, patient vitals, making bicarbonate, making 2k and 3k acid. Shipping blood work. Reading blood work. Assisting nurses and doctors."
good,I enjoy Nursing and have continued to express my appreciation in everything Ii do within my scope of practice.  I go in with the expectation of working hard and always doing what is best in the interest of my patients.
good,"A job I really enjoyed to go to everyday. I felt there were a lot of good benefits such as Medical, 401k and dental.  There were always fun meetings and rallies. They are team driven and if there was a corporate office where I moved to, Id work there again."
good,DaVita is one of the largest kidney company. A typical day at work is from the time you walk in the clinic and until the end of the day you are very busy. The company truly try to promote a fun environment for the patients and the staff.
good,"Assist patients on to the treatment floor."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Great place to grow as a manager and a leader. The company invests in the training of its employees. Because the customer is such a niche audience the breadth of experience as a markter can be somewhat limiting.
good,Great job love what I do but it's very long hours and hard to spend time with your family. They are always short staffed so it's hard to get to take time off . You get a lot of PTO but never staffed enough to be able to use it.
good,"I really enjoyed my term with DaVita (aka Gambro) and would have stayed if I could have worked eight hour days.  Unfortunately, the clinic I was in didn't have the patient load to support full time employment for me."
good,"A lot of educational opportunities. "
good,Its a good job there are thing you wont like but for the most part u will like it. it was cool would still be there I was give a better job because I was not looking
good,Most important exciting part of the day was just to see that one patient smile and say thank you.  Some of the patients were more humorous than you thought and also some patients will become just like family to you.
good,"I have a great work attitude, personable, fun, enjoy teaching patients as well as teammates."
good,Davita boast a very active workday ranging from facility escalation to lab result research. The company provides a lot of tools to their teammates and encourages personal growth by having them choose the road-map to their own career.
good,"You can still have a life working here.  Management however did not pay well, but the experience once you get your foot in the door is amazing."
good,"A typical day at work starts with a review of my daily assignments. I enjoy a work environment where teammates help each other. My coworkers are highly trained, but no matter what we are always sharing the best way to make a fistula cannulation successful."
good,Overall a wonderful place to work. Love the Village and team mate idea. Learned so much over the years. Great place to work at.
good,I learned a lot about the financial and operations of an organization. How to manage the productivity of the team in order to have a better bottom line
good,Davita  teammates work together very well. It is very organized and our main focus is best care for patients. The cons are teammates being held responsible when patients do not follow doctors orders and gain too much fluid in between treatments.
good,10-12 hr work day. The hardest part of the job includes the time required to be at work between 4 or 5 am and time management. Co-workers are very team oriented and work together to provide quality patient care. Most enjoyable part of the job include rapport build with patients that attend outpatient treatments three times a week.
good,"Great teamwork atmosphere. Great learning experience. Caring and professional management. Great benefits including tuition reimbursement. ""One For All, All For One'"
good,"Opportunity to learn new systems and processes.  Many classes, and career advancement opportunities.  Engaging managers."
good,Work at Davita dialysis clinic is a daily challenge. Daily tasks vary depending on patients needs and what the company focus is on at that time. The clinic I work at is rated 4 star by CMS. We are very proud of this achievement and continue to strive for 5 star rating. The hardest part of this job is not enough time to provide all that we are trained to do for our patients. Davita has too  much middle management that does take away from budget money that could be used more for direct patient care. Davita has provided me with a lot of professional growth.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience

DaVita creates a special place for its employees that differs from other companies because within the workplace DaVita strives to live through their Mission as well as their core values everyday.

good,"It a great place to work and I enjoyed working with the company and my team-mates and get the job done,The patients in davita are friendly and very nice,"
good,"This is one of those jobs that you either love it or you don't. It is hard work with sometimes having to take care of a patient with only 15 minutes and hope that their access dosen't bleed to much. There wasn't enough time time to take care of the patient, clean the area and get the next patient in and hooked up."
good,"A typical day at work involved supervision of dialysis techs performing hemodialysis treatments,which is  three or four hour procedure."
good,this is a fun company to work for.. benefits are great and they offer bonus to all employees for great patient outcomes. fun and a lot to do Management is fun and they make you feel welcome when you step into the job.

Being safe, yet having fun, make the work day enjoyable. Additionally, being able to help our patients have a good day is rewarding."
good,"Decent place to work very physically demanding."
good,Long hard working hours but I definitely  love the work I do nobodies perfect so I love the feeling of knowing that there is always something new going on that would help me improve on the work that I already do My co-worker are not the easiest to get along with but I don't let that affect the work that I am there to do I still some how find a way to make the best of it. The hardest part of my job is dealing with some me type of personalities and trying to comment to everything that everybody wants. The most enjoyable part is going home with the feeling of knowing that I matter at my job and that I've helped somebody's life just a little bit better and I've tried my  hardest to put a smile on their faces.
good,"A typical day at DaVita is very busy. From the time I clock in I am hustling and working toward giving my patients the best environment and treatment possible. I take a break only after all charting is complete and a final check on my patients has been done. My day ends depending on the shift for that day/or if closing every patient is gone the floor is cleared, blood tubes are spun/refrigerated and the water room is prepped for the night."
good,"long day at work, short breaks because of nature of the job, required constant observation and documentation. I love working with the patient and staff. My boss is awesome, smart and coordinate well."
good,When mu center closed they ensured I recieved a severance package.  Management were always flexible with me regarding all three of my difficult pregnances.
good,Typical work day for me because I was in the travel pool would start sometimes at 2:30 in the morning to travel to site. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job was the travel. I only left so I would have a set clinic with less travel.
good,"A typical day was meeting with patients while receiving dialysis treatments.  I always enjoyed the 1:1 contacts with patients and getting to know their families. I worked in several dialysis centers around the state and enjoyed the ""teams"" in each unit.  The hardest part of the job was watching the deterioration of patients' health over time."
good,Employees worked together to give the patients quality care
good,I enjoyed working with children and watching them learn new and exciting things. Hardest part is going into a classroom that you have never worked in before not knowing what to expect.

My Facility Administrator was wonderful to work with. She had 3 clinics to run, which prohibited her from being present at my location on a daily basis. With that, I was able to oversea entire clinic with the ability to troubleshoot. While I enjoy multi-tasking, I found that going from office work to clinical work on a daily basis was the hardest part of the job. There were many enjoyable aspects of the job, which include: Positive team moral/team building, continuous education, fun and laughter with staff and patients, maintaining rapport with patients, families, physicians and hospital employees, staying busy, having multiple responsibilities, great team work throughout the region, and fun activities throughout the year. I helped open two brand new facilities and enjoyed the knowledge learned, as well as the hard work that is needed to open a dialysis facility. I enjoyed learning all aspects of the company.

good,"Outpatient dialysis is a very fast paced environment where time management is essential.The day typically starts at 4:30 a.m. by preparing the clinic, dialysis machines, and dialysis solutions before patients arrive between 5:30a.m.-5:45a.m.  Once patients start arriving, its time for the party to get started. First we assess the patients and then initiate their dialysis treatment based on docotors orders.  Patients have to be continuously monitored to prevent any adverse occurrences. The patient is usually on the dialysis machine an average of 3-4 hours. at that time we take care of additional duties like care planning, patient education, adminstering medications, and preparing for the next shift of patients. Once the first shift of patients have completed their treatments, things get really hectic in initiating the treatment for the second shift of patients while trying to get the first shift of patients out the door. After all patients for second shift are receiving their treatment employees take lunch break, prepare for the next day,etc.  Once second shift is over usually about 3:00p.m., we clean and disinfect the machines and we are usually out the door by 4:00 p.m."

good,a typical day at davita dialysis was very busy and demanding. I have learned to work in a fast past and as a team player. My supervisor was a great team leader.My co-workers were great as well. The hardest part about the job was making sure patients were beening dialysis on time. The most enjoybale part of the job was knowing I was helping someone better live their lives.
good,"While working at DaVita for six months I obtained my certified clinical dialysis technician certification. I was in charge of starting, monitoring, and ending dialysis treatments for 15-20 patients each day. It was a very demanding job."
good,"Early start to the day, wonderful clinic manager, excellent coworkers"
good,"A typical day at work begins at 4:30 am. We work 12 hour shifts with 3 30 minute breaks. 2 off the clock and one on. I am at a large clinic with 32 chairs. Most clinics have about 20 chairs. We each are responsible for 3 shifts of 4 patients, 3 days a week. Extra shifts are available, even at other clinics. The hardest part of the job would be getting a little attached to the patients and occasionally losing one or watching them transfer. The most rewarding is always working with the patients. I have truly learned alot about myself and met wonderful people from all walks of life and of all ages, gender and race."
good,"I had an enjoyable work experience at DaVita although, like with any large company, the clinic where you work and the leadership of that clinic matter greatly. I was fortunate in that my FA was knowledgeable and professional and lived the DaVita core values. Patient care was the focus and the team worked very well together. Personally, I learned a great deal and was trained well for the tasks at hand. I appreciate the time I spent at DaVita!"
good,Being a dialysis nurse is very challanging yet rewarding. The most enjoyable part of this career is educating the patient to take care of themselves the best way possible and watching them do so. The hardest part of this career is watching CKD consume your patient's lives.
good,Very busy days. I have been here 4 months and we have already had 3 different facility administrators. My co-workers are very competent and work very hard to please the patients
good,"I deal with patients with chronic kidney failure that need dialysis treatment. I have learned a lot of over the years with the transition of a PCT to LPN in regards to cannulation, asssessments and everyday medical needs related to dialysis and other healthcare needs. My coworkers are more like teammates and we help and learn from each other. I enjoy getting up and going to work to help others and I know mt patients appreciate and know we care about their health and emaotions needs as well. The hours are quite long but the overall the job is very rewarding."
good,I love working here and the patients are great. There are ways to improve upon yourself if you ask.
good,Love the company and the business meeting. This is the only company that have business meeting and you dance doing the meeting.

good,Had to be to work @ 5:30 didnt get off until 4:30/5:00 pm. The staaff was very enjoyable and welcoming. I learned alot while on my externship with Davita.
good,i love this company so much! i left because of the money offered by my current employer...money wasnt worth it.
good,Davita Culture & Core Values are reflected in the clinics. Strong focus on outcomes & client goals. Good benefits. Variety of clinics in Jackson area to go to. Overtime opportunity. Emphasis on continuing education & growth in your field.
good,"Davita as a company is a great place to work, dialysis is a hard job and not for everyone. In my years training new hires the first thing I always tell them is you are either going to love this or you are going to hate it, there is t a gray area."
good,"I loved working for DaVita and would go back if the hours fit my family schedule. One of the most stressful things about this job was having to get patients on and off the machine so quickly, it left no room for patient issues. There was hardly any extra hands so if you got behind you were behind the whole day."
good,"Working in dialysis is very rewarding.  I was able to explore that part of nursing and found it to be unlike any other area of nursing I've experienced. It has been rewarding in that my ability to use the skills learned, make an immediate improvement in my patient's health right before my eyes!"
good,Overall good company to work for. Multiple work locations to choose from. They provide excellent training and encourage on-going education. Medical benefits and paid time off provided.

good,"Fun and productive company wherein you get to work as a team. Educating patients as well, making them understand the importance of "
good,"Sometimes it's kinda sad seeing other PCT not doing more as they should to make the patients satisfied. Patients should be the priority in this kind of job. Employees should be more compassionate to them, they need all the help they can get because of their illness."
good,"Davita is a company that goes out of its way to make employees feel comfortable. They are at the mercy of the hospitals so, sometimes, the employees can be left out in the cold. Also, when things get tight you can find them begging for help (which can be profitable, but tiring). This work has been very satisfying if you realize you keep people alive for a living. "
good,"I coordinate AKI and ESRD patient care and services. Job entails arranging, finalizing outpatient placement, and providing renal education. "
good,I do about 15-17 hrs shift for three days a week. Enjoyed interacting with patients and co-workers. Clean and fun environment to work. The manager is outgoing and easily to talk to
good,There is a good work and harmonious relationship. Patient centered and we always make sure pt's and teammates safety. There is a collaborative work place.
good,DaVita is a great company to work for just know you will work early mornings anywhere between 3 or 4 am and get off the same 3 or 4 pm. i would recommend this job to those who like dialysis
good,I choose not to give a review at this time as I am not 100 percent separated from the company.  They have extended my employment for a few weeks therefore I will refrain from giving a company review.
good,"The environment at DaVita  is awesome. The employees are friendly, like to joke and have fun. Many cultures working together with a purpose: caring for the patients who utilize the dialysis centers. "
good,We are all about our patient family and keeping the humanity in healthcare. This employer keeps it fun and is Flexible with a single mom like me. The team treats you like family.
good,"Very community focused company. They cared about their employees and have room for advancement. Was in a sales position; therefore, worked remote and traveled over 65% of the time."
good,"This company is really like treating you like a family member!! "
good,I worked at DaVita for 7 years and the only thing that I would have liked to see is the pay rate increase at a slightly larger rate than 1 to 2 percent a year.
good,The Management is always available when in need. But the pay is not enough. It is very difficult to move up into leadership. Overall it is a great company
good,"Love dialysis and DaVita has good job security, but I hated the hours and they don’t pay LPN’s and use them as technicians or nurses depending on the census."
good,Very challenging and dynamic place to work.  A great culture and it's part of everything not just writing on a poster or wall.  It's a challenge when your immediate supervisor does not share the M&V but that is usually a temporary situation.
good,"Very rewarding experience, you can get really attached to the Pt, learned a lot, the doctors was extremely nice, we had a great staff..The only problem I had was the scale was always giving wrong weight.."
good,"The job would be ideal if there weren’t so many call off’s, the pay was better, and the patients weren’t so rude and ungrateful. As far as the company, I believe they follow and believe in their mission statement."
good,This is a good place to work. You'll enjoy working for this company but each clinic is different. Some places are better than others. They have great benefits. You get a raise every year.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"It was a great company to work for, pay and bonuses by far the best.  Culture is different, but really works.  Opportunity to grow, great emphasis on what teamwork is.  Core values are a structured part of your job.  Management could use some work, expectations could lax to achieve goals. Sometimes good ppl are overlooked and that is where fault in management."
good,I am a PD nurse and I love it. Just think I am in too safe of a position to grow. It’s time to get on a new ship. Davita is great place to work. The team is great on the PD side. Hemodialysis seems to be a struggle with staffing. The benefits are good. The ability to work without being micromanaged is what makes me stay put. I am self driven and love my patients. I do have some that challenge me. The Dr’s are great teachers and drive the success of the program.
good,Left Davita due to job opportunity in a field that I had previous experience and which paid more.  The field I went into was the Oil and Gas industry.  But would like to return to Nursing due to job security and personal growth opportunities.
good,DaVita Clinical Research thrived on meeting expectations or exceeding them. They had a great work environment and I truly enjoyed working with the people that I now call friends.
good,Great Company to work for cares about the patient and employees. It is not considered a job but a village of caring individuals all striving to be the best in clinical outcomes.
good,Our team is awesome.  They make the clinic a great place to work.  We are family and most of us have each others back.. We all work together.  Its a great place
good,"Great place to work, thought I would retire there. The management would usually advance from within and notices were sent out by email for any position you had shown interest in."
good,Davita Rx was a ok company. They are very friendly and treated you like family. They made you feel appreciated all the time. The only dislike was some of the processes they had in place.
good,"Supervised and managed a facility team of 8 personnel; providing support with office supplies, building maintenance and repairs, mail room operations, safety and security for approximately 600 people in a 108-year-old, 100,000 SQ FT registered historical building. Responsible for performance reviews, time card corrections and management, time scheduling, all event coordination, and event decorations. Planning and coordinating with the property manager, contractors and vendors alike, for needed repairs, maintenance, and cubicle adjustments for medical ergonomic accommodations."
good,I’ve worked for DaVita for the last 8 years and have absolutely loved my job. They were very helpful in helping to go back to school and get my Bachelors Degree. My biggest complaint would be the poor pay and raise practices and the advancement opportunities. Annual raises are pretty low and advancement is limited in my area.
good,DaVita is fast paced direct patient care. Keeps up to date will new ways of caring for patients. Has advancement opportunities. Offers lots of benefits.
good,DaVita is a overall great place to work but the advancement to high Careers within the company is very difficult. This place is great for older individuals who are looking for steady and relaxed work life. But for the younger working person who is looking to advance rapidly this job will just be a great stepping stone full of great experience in you career path.
good,I was able to utilize my knowledge and skills with this internship. This was an excellent learning experience and my supervisor was awesome. I was able to gain knowledge and experience in the medical social work field.
good,"The culture at DaVita was unlike any other company I've ever worked for. At times it didn't even feel like a job. However, there were other times when the essential job function was too boring and I couldn't see myself doing it forever."
good,"I learned a lot in my position at Davita.  It is a very fast paced environment, working closely with physicians.  The patients are some of the nicest patients I have ever dealt with.  The people I worked with were amazing."
good,"No comment at this time. Fast paced, extensive standing. On your feet a lot. Turn over and pt care is stressful ......................................"
good,Everyone was friendly and stepped up if one person needed help. The only downfall was that I don't believe the pay was fair. In my opinion the PCT's should have been paid more then we were.
good,"My review is based off working at Davita Rx, a subsidiary business of DaVita which has closed. However, my time with DaVita is one I'll never forget. Training and development opportunities were available if you sought them out, the culture includes a lot of fun, there are peer nominated recognition awards. I absolutely loved the culture, and might have never left if they hadn't closed out business."
good,I enjoy working for davita healthcare partners everyone is very professional and like a second family. I’ve learned a lot working for this company. I’ve been here for almost 10 years
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"It's a great company to work for, like the incentives, and benefits , and my coworkers that I work with now , acutes are good , but a lil different from chronic , but I like the fun that we have as a group of great workers"
good,"Good place to work.  You definitely feel the emotions of the company's focus.  You are a part of saving someone's life, reminded everyday in your work and your surroundings."
good,"Awesome company. Truly care about patients, we moved out of state, or I would have stayed with this company. I learned a great deal from this job, and the patients were very nice."
good,There was plenty to keep busy.  The department listened to what you needed to improve the processes.  There were complimentary lunches and fun activities.
good,Working here was a busy day. It consisted of constantly moving and working alot of hours. Everyone here was like a family you seen the same people every week unless there was a new patient that came then they became apart of the family. Its repititious work but I thouroghly enjoyed my job.
good,Davita is a great company to work for. The company encourages professional growth as well as support in accomplishing goals. I would recommend this company.
good,Fast paced learning environment. Good benefits and PTO. Three 12 hour shifts each week is considered full time. Lots of opportunities for advancement. May travel to other clinics.
good,"They have a really great team of professionals that is always willing to help. Great staff and the clients are nice. Healthcare is always short-handed, but this company goes above and beyond to help their staff and clients."
good,"I love my company I do not plan on leaving the company. This is my second position at Davita. "
good,Nature of the job is mostly stressful and run by time more than anything else . Long standing hours 13 hours per day. Stressful at best . trying to manage time with quality care was difficult
good,"Davita continues to show their patients that Renal illness is a life saving treatment, and not a death sentences, and that the clinic should be considered a home away from home."
good,"Everything from keeping patients alive and comfortable (meds, restroom needs, everything). Also 14 hour shifts on a short day. Also labor work like cleaning, unloading etc."
good,A fun place to work with teammates and nice to be able to help patients. Gives opportunity to advance within the company and it open to new and innovative ideas.
good,"Davita wants what is best for their employees and offers a lot on the job, They are just a little behind on the pay scale and could definitely pay their employees more for what they do."
good,I loved making patients happy even if i had to do something outside my job description. For example a lot of patients experience high levels of cramp. I would put on my PPE and message there leg or hands to comfort them. I didn't have to do it but it made them feel as we are family and they could trust me.
good,Davita is a good place to work because you are helping to care of patients for them to continue to live.  Its hard due to the hours and the high turnover.
good,"Core values are practiced throughout. A great culture to work under. "

good,"DaVita has given me a lot of great opportunities, including a paid trip to California. It is a great head start into the Medical field for younger people."
good,Davita was a great experience. I'm wanting to manage a clinic as soon as I get my Psychology degree. No bad experiences with this company. I was at one clinic named platte woods for over 5 years. Loved the patients and my co-workers. I always wanted to show up for work. Never called in sick. I went above and beyond and was recognized for my work. Did the davit tour in 2013.
good,This was a great learning experience I learned what it takes to be an administrative assistant and make sure the facility has what it needs in order to run properly for the patients. It was enjoyable.
good,I enjoyed learning how to use a needle to put patients on the machine to cleanse there blood. I did not like how the turnover was done when patients came off.
good,"The name Davita means ""gives life"". Each day in every employee capacity we strived to bring the best customer service both internal and external because all lives matter"
good,"I love work for Davita,Rx it was a very fun non stress place to work , they really care about the patient as much as I care for then. They always try to find a way to compensate the coworkers for the hard work."
good,I loved working at Davita until we got a Supervisor who was evil. I would have continued on even with the awful pay because it was a great environment. But she was racist and rude. So I went to the competitor! I don't regret it though I miss it.
good,I really enjoyed working at this pharmacy and am sad to see my time ending at this pharmacy. I would recommend this company to everyone. Very positive environment.
good,Great environment with a great culture and mission/vision. I really liked working for the specialty pharmacy and would have continued to work here if it wasn't closing after September 23rd.
good,"Administration. Payroll scheduling inventory ordered and reports process dialyzers. Work wateroom saline mixture process labs drawn"
good,I enjoyed working here for the last 2 years. There are definitely some things that could have been done differently in management. I enjoy working with my teammates and knowing that most of us are here for the patients. It's not possible to move up here.
good,davita was a great company. I learned a lot as a dialysis nurse. I still work there part time. They are very good about making sure the staff has the tool needed to do the job.

good,"I arrived at work at 3:30 am and immediately started setting up equipment for patients. I started seeing patients at 5:00 am until 6:00 pm; I was on my feet for more than 12 hours a day. The best part of my job was the relationship I had with my patients. I enjoyed seeing them when they came in, and they enjoyed my company."

good,Most enjoyable part of the job is the patient one on one.  The job is very fast pace with no time to sit down.  There are three different shifts.  Workplace culture needs more on hand from management.
good,"DaVita is a great company for an individual looking to start their career in accounting/finance. I have worked in multiple departments and they all have strong leadership. Compensation is not competitive in the surrounding market, so most teammates leave after a few years. Workplace culture and environment exceeds expectations."

good,"Enjoyed coming to work"
good,"I was hired through their STAR training program, it really is a great company to work for. I could see the potential for growth into management, they reimburse for education (up to a certain amount), you get your Continuing education credits through work, but it is incredibly hard to wake up at 3am to go to work. I really couldn't get used to it. If I had to be there at 4:30 am, there were nights i didn't get 2 hours of sleep, then was expected to pull a 15 hour shift."
good,"A typical day at work is working with the doctors, have learned a lot about dialysis, the management team is great love the workplace.  the hardest part of the job is when a patient and the most enjoyable is the patients."
good,"Davita is an okay place to work, it is very fast paced, you will literally be running around. With that said, co workers and patients are great, you get to know patients well and laugh a lot with them."
good,Very interesting place to work. Team oriented - interactive - fast paced. Streamlined and creative.  Fun place to work - well balanced! Always growing.
good,"Davita is devoted to team work which is essential for  patient care. No one feels long or they are working in a silo."
good,"a great company to work for, Very hands on and caring. They have great insurance and they care deeply for their patients. Never worked for a company and one of there rules are for you to have fun and enjoy work."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,A typical work day is usually busy yet fun filled. No two days are exactly the same. You usually start at 6am and end at 4pm. Every other Saturday and every other weekend are musts.
good,This was a great learning experience. It was fast paced. The team worked well together. Education and growth in the company is strongly encouraged. Loved working with my patients and teammates.
good,"The two years I have worked for the company have been enjoyable. During orientation they emphasized that they were a VILLAGE, and they are. We are consistently pushed to improve. courses are provided, about any matter you'd like to know more about, within the nephology sphere. The company is very friendly when it comes to  college courses and work schedules. Employees are told self improvement was one of the company core values. It really is."
good,Davita is a place with core values and emphasis on team work. Long hours that takes some getting used to. There is something new to learn everyday. Great place to work.
good,Family oriented working culture. Enjoy having free meals and lunch with coworkers once a while. The most enjoyable part of job is to be able to work independently with minimal supervision most of the time. The hardest part of the job is to coordinates with teammates. Managers create an environment encouraging teammates to point fingers to each other when something goes wrong.
good,"Close family relations at work. Most of the people are friendly. Patients are great. Salary is good. Hours are great, PTO hours for everyone. Good benefits"
good,"I enjoyed working in an environment of workers that are team players.  Management was exceptional and always had an open door policy.   They would reward their employees for job well done.  Typical day, I would come in to work approximately 20-25 minutes early, get a cup of coffee, sign onto my computer, check emails, then check my task bar once I've completed then start my assignments.  The hardest part of the job (which isn't hard for me, I like challenges) is updating Medicare/Medicaid fee schedule in our system.  Its challenging due to us having to rely on a third party/liaison to complete.  The most enjoyable is the workplace itself, everyone was pleasant and always willing to help."
good,"Working in a dialysis clinic you become close to your patients, and finding out something went wrong and they died. Watching teenagers having to be on dialysis and having to go through changes while on dialysis and having to understand their importance."
good,"Work life balance is good, quick hire turn around, good support, always responsive. flexible working hours, no over time working, stress free work environment. Great place to work."
good,"Typical day at work: phones ringing off the hook; lots of paperwork, non-compliant patients that we are graded on."
good,DaVita is a company that really strives to sell you with culture. With its antics that are often perceived as zany. A CEO that is known to many as the Mayor. And creating a special place as one of its prime initiatives. They truly live with building themselves a village.
good,Long hard hours. Very rewarding but very sad at times.  Love my my fellow techs and nurses.  Job is demanding. It can take an emotional toll because you spend so much time with the patients when one of them dies its feels as though you lost a family member.
good,Enjoyable company to work for but lacking in training with some aspects. A lot of emphasis on advancement but without providing many of the tools to achieve new roles within the company.
good,Very nice place to work.  Very family oriented and there is a lot of focus on moving up within the company even if you do not possess a higher degree.
good,Good for learning good for hands on training also how to maintain a good healthy diet and control patients are lively just as the staff working together
good,"I have worked for Davita for approximately 1 year and I have not had any issues with staff or the company at this time. Davita is a dialysis company in chester,va"
good,the days were long but it went fast when we would work together as a team. hardest part of the job is losing a patient because we grow bonds as we see each other more than our own families so when they pass it definitely is hard.
good,"This company truly believes in its core values and the differences they make in other individual lives. To have such a large corporation that is international really displays the level of care that is readily available for dialysis patients. There are various policies and procedures that teammates must adhere to in order to provide proficient and effective care. There is many opportunities for growth within this company requiring individuals to go through on the job training programs in order to excel in their careers. The hardest part of the job  is the cultural differences between the staff which can be very challenging. In addition, the company I feel needs to compensate with the workers salary wise based on the workload. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is the patients and the relationships we build with them. Making a difference in their lives everyday."
good,"Highly team dependent on the corporate side, but generally provides good work life balance for reasonable compensation. Promotion is often external however, so be careful."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Busy, stressful but fufilling, can be challenging, politics of a big company is difficult, benefits are good, core values align well with who I am as a person."
good,Not a bad company to work for they are international and have clinis all over the united states - They have good benefits and will work with you.  The hours are long at times on MWF but you usually only work 3 to four days a week.  The environment is fast paced and will keep you on your toes.
good,"A place where you can learn new skills and get experience. Fast pace environment, diverse staff and patients. No day is the same. Culturally diverse and growing."
good,"Probably the best place I worked for overall. Heavy call volume working in a call center environment for Davita, but management was always understanding. They gave us times off the phones and really tried to make it fun."
good,"Good management"
good,I love working at DaVita.  I enjoy my patients and co-workers.  I am only there PRN at this time and am hoping to get back full time.  The company is a good place to work.
good,"DaVita is the leader in their market space, providing healthcare services to those with serious medical conditions. The corporate environment is positive and nurturing."
good,"DaVita is a wonderful healthcare company that really cares about their teammates.  They give you many opportunities to grow your career.  I've enhanced my team building, project management, event management, and interpersonal skills during my tenure.  They provide a fun environment to work and give back to the community.  It was difficult being a part of small office when all the other corporate offices across the US were very large and had numerous other activities.  The small office was also the advantage because you really got to know all your teammates on a personal level and nobody gets lots in the crowd."
good,I have many years of experience in Hemodialysis and this company has given me more satisfaction in my work place than any other. Benefits and time off are a key when working for this type of company.
good,Great opportunity to learn!  I had an amazing manager. The clinic was intense but it was doable. I love the patients and learning to push myself to the next level.
good,"DaVita was an amazing company, the work environment is something I have yet to see anywhere else. They truly do care about their employees. Would have stayed if I did not have to relocate."
good,"I was with DaVita for ten years relocating with them through three states, overall DaVita is a great place to work.  The company culture is second to none, the teams are well developed, and work well together.  You are apart of meaningful work and you never forget that what you do has impact, sometime serious, on patients lives.  I did find It was difficult to get opportunities to advance and to grow, that's why I moved around a lot early on.  The opportunities to do more than your job description are numerous, but the opportunity to take those accomplishments and transfer them into a raise or promotion was difficult, for my time I saw more external hiring than internal promoting."
good,"My typical day at work consists of answering e-mails, making proactive calls, and answering inbound calls. I learned how to pivot my job role in the 5 years I have been with this company. The management team is always understanding and willing to talk with you about your development. The culture is based on our 7 core values; Fun, Team, Continuous Improvement, Service Excellence, Accountability, Integrity, and Fulfillment. The hardest part of the job is making relationships with patients who face death every day. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with patients."
good,"Good environment to work, great people. Gives the ability to work from home, sends employees to travel. very diverse environment."
good,"DaVita truly inspires the core value of fun and teamwork, and best patient satisfaction, clinical outcome is a priority."
good,DaVita is a community first and a company second. They really treat their employees with respect and integrity and try to instill a culture in their teammates from the top down.
good,"a typical day at work started by 345 am.. I learned how to better manage my time with doing dialysis,  hardest part of the job was believing in my self and telling myself that I can do this  and I enjoyed  helping people and doing everything I could to help my pts."
good,"I loved working for Davita, learning and getting to know the patients was a plus for me. the staff I worked with was very caring and really loved the work."
good,Fun is a Core Value. I've grown professionally at DaVita. The are a lot of great people that work there. Opportunity to make a difference in people's lives.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Overall this was a great job experience.  They foster teamwork on every level from management on down.  They offer a great compensation package and bonus.  The company rewards employees that show they want to advance to areas of leadership despite title.  They encourage furthering your education by offering scholarships and tuition assistance to staff and also to family members of staff.  I would certainly work for this company again if given the opportunity.
good,"Overall very happy with the company. Many opportunities for advancement, seemed like they valued you as an employee. Unless of course you have medical issues or have a family."
good,Productive and fun work place with compassionate people who are always ready to help when you need it. I love working foe Davita
good,"I worked as a social worker for DaVita for 7 years.  As a social worker, I was respected for my education and held as a valuable member of the team."
good,Moderately fast paced outpatient unit. Adequately staffed. Fortune 500 company. Really good company to work for. Staff is well trained across the board. Great place to work
good,I have enjoyed working with Davita for the past 5 years of my employment career. They have a wonderful staff and group of patients work with. The company has been very good to me
good,"If you want to get into Dialysis, Davita is willing to properly train newcomers when many just want people that have experience already. Their raises are extremely low, so use it as a entrance to get in the field."
good,"i worked with some wonderful co-workers, at the time I had only had a couple of years or two so they were very experienced, between 15-20 years experience. And they were more than willing to take me under their wing.  My nurse Managers were very supportive and compassionate. I even was able to get my Sister and Ex-Husband a job at the same company."
good,I never work for a place who considered all employees teammates instead of employer-employee. Although we work really hard the culture was such that when there were events scheduled we enjoyed ourself or played just as hard as we work and I felt really appreciate
good,"The job culture of Davita can be amazing especially if you have the right team, manager, and doctors. Unfortunately, we cannot control doctors and their behaviors. I would say Davita is a great place to work for, but the company's need to meet numbers can be stressful especially when they are not in your control. Having to constantly work on somebody's motivation is one thing, but expecting results within a month's time is quite challenging and usually impossible. You might get yelled at or told ""you're not doing your job"" just because a patient doesn't meet their lab values. There's only so much a person can do before they get exhausted. "
good,"A day working in dialysis is never the same. Which makes that the reason why I love doing it. You learn something every day, whether that's policy and procedures, how to trouble shoot a machine or even just basic patient care. This job can be stressful at time, because you grow a relationship with your patients and seeing them go through a spiral down fall is heart breaking. I got along well with my co-workers, because at the end of the day our main concern was our patients. There was a point when we management was a constant turn over. We never could keep manager, because they were always over whelmed with the work load. All in all this job has taught me great people skills, how to multitask and above all how to be very observant. If I learned anything, it was to watch my patients very carefully and to not always depend on the machine to tell me if there is problem."
good,"Productive and fun at times. More on the serious side of life. Requires long hours on feet daily, at least 3 days a week, lifting patients from wheel chair to chair, lifting heavy boxes, only sitting down at lunch that is 30 mins."
good,"working your queues from top to bottom, making calls, going on the payer websites to see why the claims did not pay or short paid"
good,"Help educate people on how to live a better and healthier lifestyle while living with health elements."
good,You have the option to work by yourself if you like to be alone. You have days for fun Davita don't refer you as an employee you're consider to be a teammate. Option to grow in the company managers are friendly and easy to communicate with.
good,"its fun to work with patients but not with a crabby co workers, I guess. early morning isn't good when you have kids and being in a fast routine isn't good for the health workers too."
good,"Davita is an excellent company with great benefits. If you are looking for a career that is lasting and understanding of life, then this is a company for you."
good,"We had daily meetings in the morning. I had to record incoming and outgoing work. Disperse work to other employees. Entered ffs and risk charge tickets of 200 quota every day. I've learned to be a team player, help each other out. Most enjoyable part is making friends with my co-workers."
good,I was able to learn nursing in a specialized modality.  The place had its ups and downs but I got to work with some amazing people.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"I have been very fortunate to work with some of the managers who supports staff like myself in advancing my educations. I also love working with our patients, They became my second families."
good,"Davita is a good company to work for. I suggest more help and more educational classes to help on the job. Also, the  morale is very low."
good,DaVita was a very structured company. Management appeared to have all things organized for employees and if not they staffed well with individuals that were willing to work hard to get the job done.
good,"greet my patient, make them feel comfortable. make them laugh i dance and sing  for them. great team work..play bingo with them. make sure they leave the unit happy."
good,Care of ESRD patient. Good place to work and grow.  Enjoyed the patients and the staff.  Learned a lot related to Hemodialysis patient.
good,"great pay!! 1st 8 hrs reg pay, next 4 hrs time & half, anytime after 12 hrs is double time!!!"
good,"I enjoyed working with co-workers. Typical work day: preventive / maintenance repair, and water system testing. This company is also very flexible and understanding. A great company that appreciates their employees."
good,"Fresenius Medical Care (DaVita's biggest competitor) + FUN = DaVita, Inc."
good,Good pay always busy. The best thing about this job is that my coworkers was the best for the experience. Learned a lot and plan to take a lot from it.
good,There is a family atmosphere with a high degree of professionalism.  The company is well positioned for growth and on its way to being a leader in the industry
good,Davita Labs was a good company to work for.  Cares about it's employees.  I enjoyed working at this company. I recommend this company to others.
good,"Great company to work for. Excellent training program, bonuses/incentives, and school reimbursement program. Would recommend this company to anyone!"
good,"16 chair dialysis unit, team work good, patients and staff makes day go faster.  I enhanced by communication skills due to the various personalities of our patients and staff.  Time management at times is  difficult due to staffing issues but the patient's make the job enjoyable."
good,very intense job some of the people on winton rd were helpful as some where no helpful and then when you needed to ask them a questions they were either out on a smoke break or with another patient. I don't think that the charge nurse should be the one doing the training because she has other things to deal with
good,I loved working in this group because we were our own separate entity. We all got along and it mad work fun. The group disbanded in 200 and I got the job with DNP.
good,I think Davita is a great company and I was very fortunate and blessed to receive excellent pay and job advancement. I compare all dialysis companies to Davita because if you do it the Davita way - patients enjoy truly superior outcomes.
good,"My time at DaVita was short. I only worked there for 3 months as a contracted travel CCHT. My time there was pleasant, our unit was small and the patients AND workers were a close knit family. New patients needing dialysis at that facility immediately felt at home. My coworkers were also very pleasant, some doing dialysis for years and some working in other areas on business. The best part of my job was that even though I didn't work to make friends, by the time I left, I had a great group of friends for life"
good,Great place to work. Patients are awesome. Enjoyed working there I never missed a day unless I was really under the weather.
good,"I enjoyed what I did at Davita.  We all worked hard and everyone got along well and we had Fun.  I learned more about accounts payable and how it works,  It was never boring, there was always something to do or a fire to put out."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,working as a casemanager to place all patients coming from the hospital into a Davita clinic within 24hr. gathering all medical paper for thr facility admin.
good,I reviewed patient accounts and release medication for mailing. This is a fun place to work and they try to make it enjoyable to go to work. The little prep rally they have on Fridays is fun and informative. Overall it a good place to work
good,"Lives out the core values well. Busy environment, alot of direct patient care and team work, good experience, I would recommend this as a career move."
good,I was responsible for placing patients on hemodialyisis machines and monitoring their condition during treatments. I was in charge of labwork and maintaining the lab facilities.
good,This is a great work place a very fun and safe enviroment. flexible schedules weekends and holidays off. Along with rewarding lunches.
good,"DaVita Healthcare Partners, Inc. has an Award Winning and Industry Leading Leadership Team at the Corporate, Divisional, Regional and Local levels.  The footprint of the company in leading US based operations and International operations is changing not only the field of dialysis care, but helping to shape the healthcare industry overall.  Working for a company of such caliber has personally aided the development of my leadership and management skills to be able to compete across the healthcare industry as an effective leader."
good,"a comfortable environment to work, able to enjoy meeting new people and co workers are very respectful and helping, very peaceful"
good,"Great teammates"
good,My responsibilities were to receive batches and sort them. I would go through the batches and apply payments that was sent in from various carriers to patients account.
good,The people who worked here always strived for excellence. The way the patients were always treated with the highest quality of care was tremendous to watch.
good,Davita was a family oriented complany. We were all like one big family that had difference but still a company. The hardest part of my job was a patient was not happy or the family had complaints. the most enjoyable was the moral the the clinic staff had with everyone was awesome.
good,Great great great place to work!!! They believe in team work and helpin one another out. Room for advancement.
good,Excellent management and coworkers. Enjoyed the growth I earned working for this company.
good,"Very busy at times.  Called Dr on call for orders for the day for the patients in the hospital needing dialysis treatments. started, monitored and ended the treatments, trouble shooting any issues with the treatments. Called the Dr with any issues or problems with the pts.  provided education for the pt regarding their dialysis, disease process, diet, medications and activities."
good,"DaVita is a Village of teammates (employees) banded together to become the greatest dialysis company the world has ever seen.  Our CEO refers to himself as ""the Mayor."" DaVita has dialysis centers and hospital partners throughout the United States, and in 10 countries outside the United States. DaVita strives to become the Employer, Provider and Partner of choice."
good,a good enviroment to work for and learn. i learned how to keep the catheter rate down and how to keep the percentage rate for davita rx up.i like working with a strong team that's willing to help out in any crisis. the hardest part of this job is working understaffed but getting through it makes for a rewarding part of the job when seeing everyone pull together
good,Working at davita was a great experience. A work day consist of cannulating 8 to 10 patients and hooking then up to th dialysis machine. I learned alot of dialysis and how most people got on dialysis. The hardest part of the job was hearing that a patient had past away.
good,it was a job that got me through college. I was not there long but everyone there was caring.
good,Davita itself is a great company who considers its employees teammate the company a village and everyone family.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience

good,"I open the facility and ready all the machines, check the water to make sure it's safe to use for our patients.  Also to make sure it's within company's required limits.  Prepare medications, and report to RN.  Initiate patients pre/post treatment and documentations. "
good,Great company to work for. Left job to move. I would reccomend it.
good,"The patients, I enjoy going to work and hearing how their day off went and what is going on with them. I enjoy helping them and laughing with them sometimes that is the only time they have someone to talk to ."
good,"I love working with my patients. I have the pleasure of educating and making them feel comfortable while spending time on dialysis.  I've learned how to manage my time well so the day wont become an unnecessary stressful day.  We work as a team sometimes to get the job done. The only problem is that it's hard on your body, especially when you're working a lot of overtime."
good,Complex cases. Learned more about renal science. Hardest part dealing with high degree of patient non-compliance. Fun to work with teammates and get to know patients well.
good,"A typical day at work is long (usually 13-14 hours) spent almost entirely on your feet with limited breaks.  I am sure this is untrue of larger clinics, but both clinic in which I have worked are small (12 chairs and 2 shifts).  The long shifts are the hardest part of the job."
good,We Give Life! We provide life saving treatment to those with ESRD.
good,"A typical work day at DaVita is very challenging but I have a strong team behind me to back me up. Starting at 4:45 am, we begin the work day by preparing the water and stringing the machines. We may encounter difficult or unhappy patients, but we try our best to put a smile on their face by the time their treatment is complete. By working with such an experienced team I've learned patience, self- control, integrity, dependability and so much more. My Facility has pushed me and the rest of our team to be the best techs we can be under any circumstances. The hardest part of my job is growing to love my patients and letting them go when they die after a while. Despite the downfalls, the fullfilling part of my job is knowing that I make a difference in someones life everyday when I dialyize them."
good,My techs are fabulous and make the work environment great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          bye.
good,"I updated patient insurance and made sure that they had coverage."
good,The hardest part of this job was the traveling. I enjoyed working with clients in comfort of their home. I learned that the elderly like when you listen. Management was very nice and did thing accordingly.
good,DaVita is a company that definitely lives by the stated core values.  Recruiting is a very high-volume environment with metrics for all areas of productivity and customer service.
good,"Repairs of dialysis machines.Preventive maintenance of machines and ancillary equipment.Scheduling of outside vendors for building repairs and documenting these repairs.Job satisfaction that everything in my clinics runs smooth,is in compliance and safe treatments for patients dialyzing on these machines and safety in the building."
good,Davita gave me great training for the job i was to perform then allowed me to go out and put that training to work.  I was also allowed latitude in decision making to get that job done.  My work day consisted of my doing maintenance on Dialysis machines.  I learned to be aware of time management to maximize the amount of tasks I could perform during a shift.  I also had to be able to change direction because at times emergency issues would come up that needed immediate attention.  I enjoyed the fact that I was allowed to prioritize my tasks with effieciency of time and effort being my goal.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience

good,"A typical day at work starts out very early for me, about three am. I am the charge nurse, so I gather report from the staff charge nurse, decide patient acutiy and asign quilified staff. At the end of the day, I make sure all documentation is correct and in order, and report to my boss. I learned how to better solve conflict in the work place between co-workers.

good,"Progressive, fresh and creative. New to Colorado and growing both domestically and internationally."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Productive and fun environment. Awesome management and teammates. Davita cares about their employees and their happiness.
good,"Long days; co workers are overworked, short tempered to other staff; patients are great to work with; like to have fun with ; most enjoyable part of job is knowing that I am helping save a life."
good,Wish their was more room to advance.
good,"Davita is a great company to work, very family oriented, flexible hours, management is great."
good,"depending on which hours you get to come in that day it could be a good/bad day and how things are done in the morning. in the morning goes as plan without and problems the the rest of the day would be fine. otherwise it can be the other way around, then you'll be there longer. mainly the days ends of working 3 or 4 days of 12-14hrs on your feet all day, with 3 30mins break time in between. thats the only time you are really off your feet and when you go home at the end of the day at least no later the 8:30pm-9pm. besids that, you'll have to deal with some nice/rude patients on treatment untill they/you are done for the day."
good,Company is very conservative and has very little mobility. It is a great company which makes a difference in the world of healthcare.
good,I enjoyed working for the company very much. I hated they cut contracts because of their budget
good,"I have enjoyed my time here at DaVita, I have learned a lot about the healthcare field and all that it entails, and really all that can happen to someone if they do not go in for their dialysis treatments. The people I work with are awesome, everyone has their days and seeing that this is the healthcare field, there are some sad and stressful moments, some days are worse than others. The Facility Administrator is very nice at my clinic, but she is also very busy with two clinics and meetings, so I spend most of my day dealing with the day to day operations of the clinic. Fun is one of the core values of the ""village"", so we all try to keep that environment going for our patients' sakes, as well as our own. One of the hardest parts of the job to deal with is when the state comes in to do the audits once every three years, which can be very stressful. Another part is dealing with CMS CrownWeb, namely when we enter in the clinical data for each of our patients and this has to be done by the end of the month. The normal day consists of answering the phone and emails, filing documents into patient charts, reviewing and auditing charts, helping to schedule and reschedule patients, packing labs, putting stock away, taking inventory of documents that need to be sent to a secured storage facility, interacting with patients and the Social Worker and Dietician. The culture of our clinic is laid back but professional, we have casual Fridays every week, and we try to celebrate the holidays and make things as fun as possible for the staff and the patients. The people, both staff and patients"
good,"Working with teammates and patients. Completing payroll, Patient Intakes and  Discharges. Ordering supplies for the facilities such as al medications for the patients and all supplies that the nurses and techs need to run treatments for the patients."
good,"Great team. Two interviews at different clinics. Decided which one was best for me. The manager seems open and caring and fair.  It fast pace, with some down time. More hours on Monday Wednesday and Friday."
good,"I love Davita. Benefits great, hours are decent and plenty OT if u want it. Davita will train you for dialysis if you have no prior history. I encourage you to apply."
good,"Davita is one of the best companies to work for, however, some of those managers, abuses the company policy, they use Davita as their own personal domain. They said one thing, do something different. When you hired new team mates give them time to grow with the company, do not force them to quit before they learn anything about the company. Stop treating people who work for you. We’re all need someone."
good,"DaVita was an amazing company to work for. They are well established, organized, and have a great management team.  They have an awesome orientation/onboarding process."
good,It is a good company to work with.  They are willing to work with you plus help meet your needs if they can .they help with your career to move up if you choose to.
good,Davita is an great company it gives you growth to grow with them. It’s gives you the opportunity to  go back to school for advancement. The opportunity  is there all you have to do is go for it and make your dream come thrive
good,Great place for dietitians however patient loads tends to run heavy.  Good benefits for retirement.  Cigna health is a HDP.  Lots of charting but it is CMS mandated.  Good ability to grow as an RD.
good,I feel valued as a teammate at DaVita. There are so many courses and opportunities to advance and grow within the company. The culture is something that I've never experienced anywhere else before.
good,"It is an environment that provides quality care for patients.  It is fast passed and at times stressful.  They provide the opportunity to learn new skills, if desired.  It is a company that stresses work/life balance."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Davita Lewistown was overall a great place to work. It is a bit overwhelming to learn from scratch but the management supports the learning curve. some of the other co workers are demanding and rush the process but some where amazing at helping to teach and guide.
good,It was a nice place to work. I didn’t have experience when I started at this company and they hired me anyway. I learned my role quickly and the employees where helpful.
good,"The workload can get crazy At times. There is always work and it can get overwhelming."
good,I enjoyed the learning experience that I had with this company.  They gave several continuous education programs. I learned a great amount of information dialysis field. The patients were great to work with.
good,"Great company for beginning a career in the medical field, provides training with flexible hours and great opportunity. multiple locations available as well as certifications and supplemental positions to hold."
good,"I felt working for Davita provided me with the tools I needed to become extremely independent in any job I am placed in.  The management at Davita was thorough and I felt each clinic was run very well.  The workplace camaraderie was extremely apparent no matter what dialysis clinic I happened to be working that day, as I floated to most of the clinics around Richmond, VA.  The hardest part of the job somedays was being the highest person in charge, especially when there was a crisis or an emergency.  The most enjoyable part of the job, as I said before was the camaraderie among the coworkers."
good,loved working for davita good job raise my childern working for davita the hrs where great .i work there for 16 yrs  some of the people where family good times with pt and co workers. i would sometimes think about partime  hrs that is how much i miss ma co workers and the pt.
good,Great Place to work and grow. There are a lot of opportunities for training and many departments to move into. The culture is pretty awesome if you are in the right department.
good,"Its a very good place to work. The culture is great. You accrued PTO. However, there aren't any sick days or any flexibility in scheduling. The work load is a lot for the compensation."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working for DaVita, however I strongly miss working in the NICU. I have much advanced education within NICU and greatly wish to rejoin this world while not missing out on my teenage daughters lives."
good,great patient care. Team work was a breeze always ready to help one another. Management was informative ad pleasant to speak with. A lot of benefits and chances to grow within the field.
good,"My team was great until DaVita RX started doing poorly and we became part of DaVita IT and a lot of people were let go"
good,Very fast paced acute care hospital with heavy case load for acuity.
good,"A typical work day was getting your machines set up for the patients to come in, collecting you data, cannulating your patient for dialysis. It was a new experience and actually learned the function and reasoning for dialysis.  My manager was wonderful.  Everyone was very helpful.  Hardest part of the job was only have 15 minutes to get your patient in, data collecting, dialysis started all info in computer and moving on to next patient. The most enjoyable part was just interacting with the patients."
good,"A typical work day will be customer service, answering multiple pones lines for three departments and staff, filing, scheduling appointments, admissions, trouble shooting all issues that may arise."
good,"The most enjoyable part for me was month end close. Hard, hard  work, but loved every minute of it. The hardest part of the job was they were always reorganizing some part of the company. Which meant having to relearn your job or being sent to a different department."
good,"DaVita's culture offers an alignment with my personal values. The focus on Continuous Improvement, Integrity, Accountability and Service Excellence is a true match. They take into consideration your fulfillment level and work/life balance and this is a topic of discussion at every meeting."
good,"A lot of the job satisfaction will have to do with what kind of coworkers you have.  I happen to have a great team of positive helpful workers right now, and hopefully for a long time from now.  The job can be challenging at times, and over time it becomes rather routine.  Overall, it can be a great place for work and there are opportunities for advancement.   You learn a lot and are always learning.  The benefits are good, and the pay is fair.  You also can make extra money working at other clinics who are short staffed.  If you enjoy working with the same patient's on a regular basis, then this job might be for you."
good,"Grate Management, good teamwork. Excellent working environment."
good,"Most days would be pretty laid back, but management started falling off and becoming non existent. The culture and team were very close. We would have team outings from time to time that were enjoyable. The hardest part of the job would've been dealing with management and certain calls they made or blowing situations out of proportion. If we were asked to work weekends they would offer us breakfast."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"I like my job here, the only issues really is the hours that you work. We arrive to work at 5am and stay to sometimes as late as 6pm. I have been just looking for something with better hours but feel that I will stay on PRN for Davita even if I do leave full time."
good,"While working for Davita Rx, it seemed like they are always having offsite Team building events.  This creates a comfortable work environment. Management has a broad knowledge base of the Rx business. Hardest part about working for Davita RX was learning the infrastructure/ IT/ RX /Hippa. Most enjoyable part was getting to know  the workers on the floor."
good,DaVita is an amazing place to work! The culture is like no other I have encountered and I recommend it anyone that is hard working and likes to reach for perfection at all times.
good,Prefer not to write a summary regarding a company I actively work for. There are many positives about this company especially the people and the culture.
good,Good company and benefits.  Good culture to work in but the core business of DaVita is Kidney care and they did not understand all of the business components of the medical group side what it will take to make the risk business model work well.
good,Work with the autonomy to feel respected and still have the support of a caring atmosphere if needed. We worked as a team  and helped each other  if we were having difficulties and celebrated our achievements.
good,"Work and personal life balance is a plus here. I work 3-4 days a week, giving me plenty of time off during the week to get things done. If you want a job in healthcare and truly enjoy helping people, I highly recommend working here. However, compensation and benefits are not the greatest. The management here is great, things are fair and the workload is spread evenly. A typical day at work requires setting up dialysis machines for your pod (pod is 4 patients per shift, 2-3 shifts per day). I generally care for 4 people at a time, and have a total of 8 patients per day. This is very fast paced work, but very rewarding."
good,"DaVita is a good company with many different roles available, especially if you are in Denver by Headquarters. However, with rapid growth some people are placed in management roles that may not be ready for management responsibilities."
good,Culture is this company's mainstay.  It is informative and unique and team members immediately become united to the cause and purpose. Training is required and ongoing and management does an excellent job at making in interesting and engaging.
good,"Davita is a good company to work for, I'm looking for something I can further advance in, and enjoy my self everyday. Patients are the best feature at davita fun and loving but yet challenging at times."
good,"Good compensation, benefits.  Excellent on-boarding process for new to dialysis nurses.  Company is generous with ongoing education.  Hard work that is sometimes stressful."
good,"This company values hard work, effort and dedication.  Unfortunately, not with their benefits.  The insurance provided is minimal and their 401k is not matched.  This is compensated with bonuses throughout the year."
good,"I love working at DaVita! Typically, I go in, look over what needs to be done for the day (ie. filing, new patients, visiting/traveling patients, transplant paperwork, etc.) and get everything done. I am given the ability to work at my own pace and organize my workspace in a way the works for me. There are constant interuptions all day. Whether its the phone, a patient or another staff member that needs something, you have to be able to stay on task."
good,The days is filled with work but the company is somewhat laid back and this can make for an enjoyable place to work.  The hardest part of my job was having to work late hours a lot of the time but you would be able to still cut your time off when you reached 40 hours as long as your work was caught up.  I enjoyed moving from clinic to clinic to work.
good,"Workplace with amazing culture, fun and friendly people and supportive management. Provided good benefits and above average salary for that region. Ensured that employees had good life/work balance."
good,"DaVita is a great company that delivers on its promise for core value commitment, employee development and growth. All the members of the leadership team welcome their teammates with open arms and takes extra steps to help you grow your career within the organization."
good,I truly enjoyed this company and if my work didnt interfere with my daycare I would still be working for this company. It is a highly stressful job though.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"My clinical group assisted GNAs with the patients they were assigned to help with their activities of daily living. It wasn't the best experience, but at least it made me realize I didn't want to pursue my path as a CNA."
good,"DaVita is not just a work place, but a place that I come into everyday with my fellow coworkers and strive to do things ""the DaVita Way!""  This basically means balance personal life from your work life, give courage to make bold steps, an ability to work with others and empower them to maximize their abilities to change so they achieve their goals."
good,Great place to work with awesome work life balance. If pay and retirement plan was better it would be the perfect place to work at.
good,"Super agradável o ambiente, boa equipe, uma gerencia que sempre esta disposta a ajudar o fucionario."
good,I loved working at DaVita. Culture was awesome. They had an awesome training program and gave teammates the opportunity to learn and grow. great company if you looking for structure and stability
good,"I enjoy the fast pace in a dialysis setting, like to be engaged with my patients and to establish a long-term relationship. I assess all of the patients before starting their dialysis treatments and after they have completed treatment, and monitor them throughout their stay which is typically 3-4 hours. I have 4 shifts daily. I treat patients for pain, treat and report any instability and monitor for infection. I give antibiotics, dress central lines and monitor these for infection, as well as monitor and treat underlying disease processes such as anemia, hypertension, bone disease and diabetes. I follow labs, vaccinations, and medications and follow up with nephrologists, pharmacists, specialists, and hospitals and long-term care facilities. I am responsible for the coordination of care among all patient providers and also have a team of technicians who work under my license and I monitor and enforce policy and procedures and make sure we provide a safe patient care environment."
good,Great culture and fun environment to work. Room for advancement. Management believes in promoting from within as much as possible.
good,"DaVita gave me a good taste of what the medical field is all about. I love my job and I love working and helping others. I learned a lot about dealing with patients, teammates, policies and procedures. Management was a little inexperienced which made things tough on the clinic at times, but overall the team would work together and pull through."
good,"My typical day is meeting with patients in the waiting area, in my office, or on the treatment floor to assess and address any issues, concerns, or potential social worker interventions that may be needed."
good,"Great Hours, excellent leadership, and joyful culture. Benefits could be better - no 401k match. However, other intangibles such as scholarships for students and teammate's children, good bonuses, and many employee discounts with a variety of vendors."
good,"working as a dialysis nurse is  challenging, consider a day as a busy day. I learned a lot of things from preparing machines to educating patients. as a manager, I am always on top making sure that the unit is safe and operational. I have a good relationships with my co-workers, The hardest part of my job is correcting my coworkers who deviates from policy and procedure and catching with all the reporting deadlines but I enjoy My job even though at the end of the day, my body is giving up...."
good,"I would wake up at 5:00 a.m. drive to the office and see what hospitals have broken machines and then load up the machines and fill the box truck almost entirely of supplies and head to hospitals that I take care of. I do this on a daily basis and I would be on call Monday through Sunday, every other week. The hardest part of the job was being on call it would take a lot out of the person on call."
good,"I worked with great people and professional chefs. Super easy commute from home. I had the opportunity to work with some of the best Chefs and Hospitality professionals in country. As well as showcase my management and culinary skills on a large scale. Serving 300-500 people per day just for lunch was a fun, hectic, stressful, and exciting experience."
good,"Culture with in DaVita Healthcare Partners is ever evolving although, it is one which includes teamwork, teammate recognition and fun. They embrace their core values and work diligently to improve their teammates skills providing an exceptional amount of education opportunities."
good,"Fun place to work, team work and everything , free food, constant meeting. mgmt are great down to earth, provide growth in carreers, great benefits."
good,"I learned about insurance claims, Data entry, Teamwork. "
good,Fill orders for  patients.great place but in order to learn everything as a tech you would need to work in different departments.
good,PCT was a good job. I gained weight working there from all the free food. The breaks are nice enough to recoup. Can be stressful at times if you close. Patients are nice and the experience was good. It was a nice experience. There is not much advancement other than becoming a nurse or nutritionist.
good,DaVita is all about a well balanced work place.  Patient care first but have while doing it.
good,"This is a good company to work with, very profesional with great people."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Its a Great Place to work, I enjoyed the culture and the people were all very nice. Management was good. I loved my coworkers and my team. Hardest part was Dealing with Irate customers but was all the same rewarding and fulfilling when I solved a problem for a customer."
good,Medication and monitoring patients while receiving Dialysis treatment
good,great place to work. great company. in facility management needs improvement but great company overall
good,"Davita is a great place to work. Challenging opportunities, great corporate structure and working up through the company is based on merit."
good,"DaVita is a unique company to work for, where its values are front in center in most aspects of work. It starts at the top with Kent Thiry leading the way with every town hall starting in chants and core values"
good,"My experience with Davita was amazing! They were a great company to work for and stuck to their core values of Service Excellence, Integrity, Team, Continuous Improvement, Accountability, Fulfillment and Fun! Spending 6 years at Davita has really helped me grow as a young woman and helped me incorporate those values into my own life. The most enjoyable part of my job was the feeling that I was helping the patients, even though I did not meet them face to face. I also enjoyed the people that I worked with and the relationships I have built with them over the years. We considered eachother more as family rather then co-workers."
good,A very nice company to work for. I loved the way employees are valued at this company where employees are taken for face value but are invested in. Miss working there.
good,"I learned quite a bit from my 2 and a half years working for DaVita, Inc. I learned how to work safely and productively even under stress and pressure. I learned how to deal better with adversity and how to be more open and less shy. My manager is one of the best managers I have worked for because she gave me an opportunity to learn more about dialysis in becoming a technician and really helped me to be more outgoing. "
good,I worked for davita for five years. And when I lost my job do to a co-workers mental problems it was a life altering experience. It's a great place to work everything there is great .
good,A typical day for me would be fast paced and exciting I love to learn all types of things. Im interested in growing with a company and becoming an RN. I love my coworkers they make my day go by really fast and make any day quite interesting. There isn't anything I can think of that would be considered as the hardest part of my day because I love what I do. The most enjoyable part of my day would be interacting with patients.
good,Goal driven & focused. People oriented. Ice cream truck pulls up outside and the word is for everyone to go down and get their free choice of ice cream..sometimes you can get two. Pretty neat perk eh? Plenty of parking. Building is badge protected. Town halls are informative yet hilarious.
good,this was an ok job. when you work with a lot of females sometimes there can be trouble.
good,We take pride in our patient to ensure the best quality care possible
good,DaVita is an excellant company to complete an externship. They fully involve you the area you are supporting and my trainer and manager actively coached and encouraged me. The work hours allow for a good work/life balance.
good,"The Nurses were very knowledgeable, and always wanted the best for each patient."
good,I have worked for DaVita since 1996. They are a national and international corporation with excellent training programs and a high standard of values. I have throughly enjoyed my many years with them and hope when I relocate in the next few months to the east coast I am fortunate enough to find a position in one of their many facilities.
good,"DaVita is a great place to work because of the compassion, stability and job security that the company offers. DaVita also offers competitive salaries and great opportunity for growth."
good,"When teammate have an issue/problem with the dataflow or anything please help them to solve it, don’t directly make a decision to terminated the teammate without giving a confirmation or giving a time to fix that problem."
good,"davita is an interesting company to pay for, youre not going to get rich but it full of opportunities and good people if you look for them. like any other job it is what youre going to make of the experience."
good,I spent 25 years working with davita and had every intention of retiring from them; due to union activity and what I believe was my show od support od unionization my job was eliminated without notice. I enjoyed the culture and truely loved what I did and the patients I served
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,The work environment was awesome everyone is very nice and welcoming. I loved working in the lab because I was able to see some interesting specimens.
good,"You must know how to multi task, be on your feet for 12 hrs. It’s a great company to work for. I worked there for 14+ years before cancer forced me on disability. Otherwise I would still be working there."
good,"I am happy working for Davita. Even if I have to wake up at 3 a.m. and go to work, but I am still happy. The clinic is like my second home. Everything is great specially my co workers. Patients are nice. We laugh a lot here.  We have a lot of good things to share with each other.  The only weak part in davita is the pay.  Technician is getting 15.75 hourly.  You can work at in&out or walmart with the same pay and you are not responsible there for someone else’s life."
good,"It really depends on the type of management you have at your clinic. I for one, had a wonderful manager therefore I loved where I worked. Unfortunately, I was hired by the management before him therefore my compensation was not the going rate for my position. However I left due to moving. Great company, would work as a dietitian for them again."
good,"excelente ambiente laboral, colaboración escucha y ayuda de parte de la administración."
good,"The culture/atmosphere at DaVita Rx was completely different than an other pharmacy job that I have ever had.  The people were friendly and open, hour lunches, everyone knew everyone's name, hugs (if you wanted them) were not unusual.  We were a very close knit family. Sadly, DaVita Rx is no long open."
good,"Working for Davita was a great experience. It was a very meaningful job. The work environment was all about team work, which I loved. We the staff and patients were a big happy family. Working for Davita, I learned so more about dialysis. It's ultimate importance to every patient, to help them live another day. Well the hardest part of the job was always losing a patient. It was like losing a family member, it never was easy, but you learn to adjust to what life puts before you, and continue to care for the patients. The most enjoyable part of the job, was the respect, compassion, and love that you have for your team, and all the patients that you encounter."
good,Working multiple units created a conflict in meetings.  Liked working with the clients.  Tour Davita was a fun fundraiser.  I was chosen for a bonus for work skills.
good,Management was looked out for what you looking for in a job role. While working there since 2011 I have slowly worked to better roles within the company and have gained a tremendous amount of experience.
good,"I love working for this company. However for the amount of work put into the job if you do not met the expectations of the upper heads, even if you are there from 5am to 12am for weeks straight bending over backwards for them, you will not get the raise you were told by your FA you deserve. And if the census is down in your clinic your hours will be cut. These are things that the company needs to work at getting better on doing, not cutting hours for your teammates and not giving them their raise because their office isnt clean enough for them."
good,"starts with starting the water system, setting up machines and then allowing patients to enter to start daily treatments. the patients are what make the job fun and enjoyable and the co workers."
good,Hectic difficult but many good people I it. Overworked and tired .difficult patient population. We tried to help each other. As a team we tried to cope with the many changes and demnads of this job. Under Medicare  and Department of health which are unforgiving.
good,DaVita moves very fast from the time you get there at 4am to the time you leave 6pm -9pm depending on your position. The people I work with are great. we work as a family and make sure everyone is taken care off. The Hardest part of the job is waking up and being there at 345 am -430am depending on your position and if you open or close that day.
good,"Structured environment, sound management.Willingness to work with employees on all levels whether professional or personal. Team oriented. Great benefits."
good,Great company to work for!!! The employees are very well taken care of and the training for the position is the best of the best. JOb security and advancement is very possible.
good,"loved the work peers. loved the environment. mostly all the work peers had smiles on there faces everyday. loved the management, they always kept there promises"
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Excellent Company to work for. Davita really cares for their employees."
good,Great company to work for that has good benefits. Provides a ladder for advancement in the career. There is job security in this company.
good,"Overall a good place to work, moral is good, They will work with your schedule to allow for a homelife. They pay Milage for offiste work"
good,"Busy but great place to work. Management is really great, always a team effort. Would recommend to someone looking for a fast pace work environment."
good,"Great teammates, learned a lot through DaVita, pay is low and hard to get a decent raise. Great bonuses, will train for the job"
good,I love working with DaVita the workplace has great management and the staff believe in giving great service to the patient.
good,This is probably one the best company that I have had the pleasure of working for in many years and I attribute that to great leadership and a clear vision for the company.
good,"This is the greatest JOB I've ever had. The management is great, the job is challenging, I make my own schedule, and the pay is competitive. The most difficult part of the job is timing when to work on preventive maintenance."
good,"Dialysis is very informative. I learn a lot about kidney failure working here. The management here was great, wonderful personality. the hardest part of this job was turn around. which was getting patients off the machine and then to put another set of patients on. the enjoyed working with paitents."
good,A day at work is making sure fed ex boxes are opened and specimens are delivered to the floor asap. Make sure teammates sort and process specimens in a timely manner for laboratory testing.
good,"Just awesome people all around, awesome benefits, hardest part of the job was leaving the company. I loved that everybody was celebrated and there was always something to celebrate. Loved that they took such great care of the employees and their health."
good,Davita is the first company I worked for that truly exercise the core values day in and day out. They also do things like the Rx Victory award that's a bonus you get for meeting stretch goals two quarters out the year. All front line teammates start as a guest teammate then depending on rather you fit for the job and culture you will be converted to a permanent teammate. I think if you have worked in the pharmacy industry for a long time and your ready for growth and stability get with DavitaRx.
good,"Loved working for DaVita. The hours are not the best, but the teammates, pay, benefits, and management are wonderful."
good,"I have worked for DaVita for almost 3 years, I do so enjoy my job position and other positions I have had with DaVita.  This is a place where you can learn and grow and spend a wonderful work life here."
good,"I have worked with the company for 5 years. I love the work environment, my teammates, and the great employee perks that are available. Employee discounts are great across the board."
good,"A Typical day in my department is, If you have been trained on the job functions, which there are three parts to the whole department, you can go from one function to the next. Being agile and flexible are big qualities for DaVita's Imaging Center. you first learn to Prep, than to Scan, then if you metrics are good you then learn the correspondence lane. My day usually consists of, I start out prepping documents, which you prep Cash documents, Business office documents, or recycled cash. After that is completed or according to the schedule for the day they move me to scanning the documents into the system so the other departments are able to do their job, and then there is the Correspondence side of the department which i have not yet been trained on. They make sure all the document arrive from the banks and that items are not missing though the mail."
good,Providing outstanding care to patients with kidney diseases.
good,A fast paced environment dedicated to providing excellent patient care provided by nursing and patient care team services.
good,Overall good experience.  Work day starts off hectic and ends hectic.  I learned the value of time management.  Management was ok at times could be better.  Co-workers were helpful.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with constant changes and management remembering changes handed down to the workers.  Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting employees and providing excellent customer service.

good,"Having only worked at the Virginia Surgical Vascular Center a few times now as a PRN rad tech; my experience with them has been top notch. Both caring and professional, the team at VSVC are great to work with. The clinic supervisor is very open and easy to talk to, giving a relaxed and engaging way of dealing with patients and staff members. Each time I go in I learn something new about dialysis patients and surgical procedures. At this time I am only operating the C-arm during their cases but I hope to eventually learn to scrub-in and assist the doctor."
good,Love the educational aspect of PD and room for growth in the company. The hardest part of my job is having to be available to patients 24/7. The most enjoyable part of my job is having such a close relationship with patients and care givers.
good,"Truly a wonderful place to work. Working with a positive and supportive team. The work schedule is flexible and independent. Patients are great. You learn so much as a renal social worker. The FAs in both White Plains and La Plata are truly wonderful people. They both provide a great deal of support, foster a respectful/professional work culture and really care about their employees/patients. The team respects social workers and are very encouraging/value your feedback. Workload is heavy managing two clinics but you never are bored and the team/work environment is amazing."
good,I am a new employee to DaVita but my experience so far has been positive.  My manager makes sure I am paid fairly and getting the training that I need.  So far benefits have been very good.

good,"The culture at Davita is second to none. The employees are all friendly and so very welcoming. They make you feel at home, regardless of how far away your actual home is."
good,It's hard work but if you're willing to put in the time you will get a lot of satisfaction. You would have to deal with people who are very sick and have many other issues so be emotionally prepared for that. This is not the kind of job you talk about at dinner parties.
good,Working at Davita I have a great work life balance. Management is great. Employees voices are heard. Culture is positive. A lot of innovative changes. Training is efficient.

good,"This company stand on their core value and mission statement; they also, prepare and equipment their teammates to be successful in their role. The company is awesome."
good,This environment was an outpatient dialysis unit. This environment was such that you could serve the community and allow patients to maintain their normal lifestyle. You could immediately see the gratitude in these patients day by day.
good,It was great place to work.  Employer cares for fellow employees and is well respected and treated.  Environment is different in a good way.

good,"We start our day at 4:30-5:15 every morning. We begin to take patients in at 6:00 a.m.,at that moment the fun begins. I love the fast pace environment of the hemodialysis center. Although, I work in an outpatient setting at any moment my patients can become critical."
good,Davita is a fun environment to work in. I enjoy my patients and getting along with my teammates. The hardest part of the job is losing patients that you have bonded with.
good,"DaVits knows that in other to put the patient first, they must go through the staff. DaVita uses their seven Core Value to motivate the staff, so the then the staff can make the patients their first and only priority while patient receives treatment."

The managers and leads always promote the culture of ownership and accountability. Finally they often organize events to promote healthy living habits and work-life balance.
good,"In my 3 years with Davita I have learned alot about building business relationships through strong interpersonal skills. I learned the in and out of dialysis in the hospital setting as well as in an outpatient setting. What I enjoyed most about my job is the patient and family interaction. I was the go to person within the hospital for any dialysis discharge planning needs, so I end each day with a sense of satisfaction that I am making a positive impact. I do hope that I find from a new job the same sense of making positive impact on an individuals life. That is my true enjoyment from my current job."
good,"I consider myself to be very hard working, quick learner, patient, and trustworthy. I have been dedicated to the medical field for over twenty years, just recently expanding to experience by entering into the medical billing and coding program at Everest institute."
good,They go all out and help you get where you want to go and what you need to do your job. They are all about their patients and their employees. They give you the tools and then some to get the best job you can get done right the first time.
good,"Serving others our reason for existing. We continually seek to understand the needs of those who depend on us (our patients, doctors, and our fellow team members) and then to exceed their expectations."
good,"DaVita has been a wonderful company to work for. The core values and mission of the company are lived everyday in individual facilities. The company acts as a ""village"" or community where its teammates really matter."
good,"DaVita Dialysis is a very enjoyable place to work. They take their time teaching the employees how to operate their system. They provide a peaceful work place. "

Team building and company pride is promoted through out if you are willing to listen and join to “drink the look aid”. I had an over all enjoyable, fulfilling time with the company. If you have the pleasure to work for them, take the time to advance yourself and make yourself known. This company is definitely worth the time and they will give the opportunities if you work for it!"
good,love my patients and what i do for a living ..theyre patient schedule was awsome had enough time to take care of my patient from start to finish with no rushing
good,Davita was a great place to work. Its either you will love or hate dialysis. Dialysis is not for everyone if you like change you wont like dialysis the work is repetition.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"DaVita Dialysis is on its' way to becoming the Largest Dialysis Centers the world has ever seen & I am proud to be a part of this mission! DaVita's compassion & true care we provide to our Patients has proven positive outcomes for Thousands of Patients.  DaVita ensures our Patients come first ALWAYS!  Working for this Village is fulfilling one of my own personal life's goal. To help Patients in need.  This is what I'm here for AND.....incorporate FUN while helping our folks....getting the right stuff done!"
good,"Recording vital statistics such as blood pressure, pulse rate, weight, and temperature. Connecting the hemodialysis machine to access in patient's forearm or catheter site and start blood circulating through the dialyzer. Prepare the machine by making sure it is clean and sterile, prepare dialysis solutions and connect the patient to the machine. Monitor the machine and patient throughout treatment. Inspect equipment settings to make sure everything meets safety standards."
good,"The company is wonderful, exciting, and have excellent mission and values. However, the facility that I'm currently working does not always live up to my expectations and the DaVita standards."
good,"Management makes the team grow or fall. Sadly management has made me decide to leave the company. I have definitely enjoyed all that I have learned, but it is time to move on."
good,"My co-workers were the backbone of the company and getting things done in a timely fashion, teamwork made the whole experience each and every day the best."
good,Too many hours to work .management  doesn't care how burnt out you are . Your job is to keep showing up to work.some team mates are cool but most are back stabbers.
good,"Great actual work, very unstable management, lots of benefit options, but barely affordable, great for urban setting, but not so great with rural areas,"
good,Completed 180 hours for my medical externship. Monitered PH levels  and sterilized dialysis equipment. I had to completed this job in a professional manner to reach my goal as Certified medical assistant.
good,"Although, the corporate office shared the fun aspects of the company, a typical day at work would be extremely overwhelming. Management were difficult to please. "
good,I love my place of employment and especially my patients and my work environment.
good,I enjoy working with the teammates at DaVita. DaVita makes it easy to enjoy working together.
good,"It was a great place to work, but a lot of work got don at home and expectations were astronomical. I learned management on my own, the culture was presented as fun, which it was. I would go back, but there are no jobs available at the level I was at and it is to learn something new!"
good,"I worked the graveyard. With a crew of 4. We were essentially janitors. "
good,"Good company.  However, the facility I worked at had ""political"" issues and and clicks.  I remained neutral along with a few others but did not agree the ""politics"" i had to witness.  Clinical manager who was a former Paramedic whom achieved his RN hired me specif because of my past work history and ethic.  He wanted to change the ""politcal"" dynamics and help the tension loosen.  Plus with my job history made myself  very qualified for medical emergencies, even among the RNs and LVNs."
good,A typical work day start between 4 -4:30 a.m. Mon-Sat. I line patients machines with disposable lines and dialyzer. Patient treatment usually start around 5:30 a.m. I learn something new every day during dialysis simply because new things are being discovered within this field. Rather it is patient care safety or clinical care safety. Management could be a little better with communication and how to properly speak to someone. Hardest part of my day is knowing that I will not please every patient but that doesn't stop me from making sure all patients are safe with a smile on their face. The most enjoyable part of my day are my coworkers. I enjoy the talks and laughs we have each day. I also enjoy how we help and work together to make each ones day a little bit better.
good,"Una empresa donde realice mi parte como ingeniero dando soluciones a muchos problemas que la clínica venía trayendo como la mejore de  la parte mantenimiento a bombas y etapa de ultra purificacion."
good,"Exelente compania para comenzar en el campo medico, buen entrenamiento"
good,Overall a great place to work! The pay and benefits could most definitely be upgraded since you are helping save lives. I was blessed to be at a clinic with awesome patients and coworkers too!
good,"Davita is a great company to work for. Availability to advance career to those who want it. Very VERY quick paced.  At times it seems they only care about the numbers. However in my opinion because they care about great numbers it reflects that the better numbers are healthier patients.  A lot of time it's mostly women so it can be catty, if you allow yourself to be lowered to that standard.  I'm still there per diem, left to a company with cheaper insurance.  Otherwise, I'd still be Full Time."
good,"I loved being employed as a Patient Liaison but it was very stressful and 12 hour days! I had too many responsibility for a large hospital and I had to meet every patient new to Dialysis or already on Dialysis, verify insurance, lots of telephone conferences and computer input. I was a salaried employee and worked 12 hours a day. I loved helping the patients but the social workers didn't help as much as they should. I worked very long days and it was not appreciates by Davita. They monthly report was not accurate when edited by Management."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,My patients and co-workers were amazing and I still to this day go visit and speak to ex co-workers. There are a few glitches in management but overall great place.
good,"The culture at DaVita is one I implement in my everyday life. A typical day at Davita you can expect service excellence, continuous improvement as well as fun. I learned working here that you matter and teamwork only works when everyone is involved. The hardest part of my job is motivating others you never know how someone day  is going. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing our clients smile with appreciation."
good,"Great place to work, learned many tool that I can use. Great great place  to work"
good,Working for davita has been great. There are a lot of incentives and many opportunities to learn and move up the ladder. I am very happy to work for such a company
good,"Enjoyed the initial training and the trip to Denver for a great conference. Excellent management, fun co-workers, steady hours. Very strict quality control measures."
good,This place pays the workers below what nurses should be making. Nurses are have to work extra days just to make ends meet. The hiring process was not friendly and it has been a traumatic experience. Many coworkers stuck in their ways and lazy people. This company tricks its workers constantly and don't give you your money. If you want to work here make sure you check all your pay stubs.
good,"overall the work is fun and fulfilling. I enjoy serving our patients, teammates and community to provide excellent healthcare. i enjoy working here and would recommend it to others"
good,Davita is an excellent company. It is a very productive company that provide patient-centered care. Davita cares for their employees  with the same intensity with which they care for our patients.
good,Loves the atmosphere and the job over all.. I just got in over my head.. would suggest this job to anyone. Keep up the good work guys you will be missed
good,"DaVita trains all their employees well to ensure their success. When training was completed, I felt prepared and ready for a field totally new to me. The environment was great along with the benefits. I especially loved the Friday pep rallies to celebrate team and individual accomplishments. In a short amount of time, it felt like family. I only left due to my husband’s job relocation. If remote work was available, I’d return to this company."
good,"You work three days and get four days off.  You can pick up overtime,  I am getting twelve patients per shift, could be hard if you do not have good techs."
good,Every clinic is different if you work in center dialysis. If you have a positive outlook then your experience and training will be positive. Everyone who will train you should have a positive outlook. If you receive poor training please speak up your administrator or someone should be willing to improve your experience. With any job be willing to work hard and learn. There is advancement if you want to grow at DaVita
good,"Davita is a great company to work for, if they had one closer to me I would apply again. There was conflict with the staff, words were turned and twisted but all in all the company is great. I love that educating the staff is important part of the company."
good,Working at Davita is a wonderful experience for any one looking for a change in their medical career. The ppl here are very nice and really care about their employees and patients

good,Enjoyed working for DaVita helped to advance my skills. DaVita provided leadership skills to advance myself to a higher level  of education and obtain a Bachelor degree in Healthcare  Administration and Management.
good,"Davita gave me the opportunity to learn  a career and got the experience to work in a field that was new to me, but that new opportunity gave me knowledge  to continue opening doors to a better job."
good,DaVita was an excellent place to work. The atmosphere and the people there are respectful and pleasant to work with. DaVita is a great and expanding company and I would recommend to anyone looking for a career within the field.
good,Good company to work at. Depending on your position your day will look different. Good place to develop your leadership skills. >>>>>............../..

good,"DaVita offers some flexible scheduling, autonomy with job performance and opportunity through Webex and online learning to advance skills and opportunities.  Core values are strongly adhered to in the company."
good,Work load is so heavy it is hard to have work life balance.  I do not feel that I am compensated fairly for the work load.  I am a manager of 13 teammates and 11 facilities.  I have teammates that make more than I do and they manage just one program of patients.  Very disappointing.
good,"A place where you can learn new things, have remote options."
good,"good job , good people , good management, long hours great teammates , no holiday, fair staffing, peaceful place , good pay , good people, everybody is family"
good,"DaVita is a solid company to work for, very established. though, as a nurse the workload can be overwhelming. there is a lot for the nurse to stay on top of. if nursing assignments were all that was required of the job, it would be great. unfortunately direct patient care assignments are part of the expectation. as well as a limit on overtime, making completing all nursing tasks and providing patient care a challenge. I do not recommend a salaried position at this company. all managers I've spoken with are worked well over 40 hours every week, usually with direct patient care expectations."
good,"Enjoy my job. I started as a dietitian, them promoted to Facility administrator. I enjoy the work and it is challenging. I am struggling with work life balance and would like a change."
good,I love my patients they are what make my day. From the short time i have been here I've grown to love this company. Teamwork is amazing and my co-workers are always pushing me to be better everyday. What i enjoy most is getting to know my patients and having that bond with them.
good,Awesome company.if u work hard and do more then asked of you they will award you and advance your skillset and position.i enjoyed my time with them and was always treated with respect and my hardwork was always appreciated and acknowledged
good,Work days were long but never felt long being able to communicate and have that relationship with your patient was good.  Felt good to take care of my patients and making them feel better.
good,It was a very nice place to work although the continual change of management made it difficult to be able to know which one wanted what. I loved my time with the patients and taking care of them.

good,"Great culture, good development opportunities.  DaVita cares about its teammates and while there are high expectations, there is also a cooperative spirit and rewarding place to work."
good,great place to work as far managing was horrible the hardest part was the turn over it was very fast paced. the most enjoyable was the patients I miss them
good,Busy workday. Registered Dietitian is a valuable member of the team. Physicians are very receptive to recommendations.  Quality staff. Fun and inviting work atmosphere.
good,Fue muy agradable todo muy organizado es una empresa con profesionalismo
good,"Very fast paced environment. Have to have a large knowledge base and be able to keep up with the patients and turnover. Nice because you get to know you patients really well. "
good,"A normal day starts at 2:45 am at the clinic where we have to start by checking our water system to see if its clear of any harmful chemicals to start producing bicarb for the day. Then around 3:15 we would start preparing the machines for the first shift of patients. When 4:20 am would hit the doors to the facility would open and we would start cannulating patients and starting treatment. Second shift would start around 8 am the second shift of patients would come in and we would do the same. Around 11 to 12 there would be a lunch break and third shift would begin to start. Up until the last put on at 3:30 pm"
good,It was good start to my career. It was a lot of work though and they were short staff. They however have good hardworking teammates. It was fun working with them
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Davita Rx help Patients we a great services this is the best part of my job, but sometimes I feel working for customer services and not like a Pharmacy Tech, is time to change and grow in my career."
good,Very busy facility with many team members working well together. Learning how to work in an outpatient environment very challenging.
good,A typical day at work is providing treatments for dialysis patients. I have learned organizational skills and work well with co-workers. The hardest part of my job is when a patient decides to go to hospice. The most enjoyable part of my job is to see my patients happy while they are getting their treatment and talking with other patients.
good,A company that sticks behind its core values. Patient care is of top priority. Many opportunities for RN's and Patient Care Technicians available.
good,"Davita is an awesome company with a great culture and people. However, the recruiting department was a complete wreck. Poor management, terrible compensation with unequal pay structures. High turnover made team-building impossible. Needs repair. Recruiters are not recruiters here, they're glorified admin."
good,"Management is amazing. Typical day would be coming to work and working your reports, projects, and book of business. Taking on additional projects as assigned."
good,Great company that cares for employees. They train and prepare their employees very well. They offer many different and great opportunities at this company.
good,"1. Typical day at work usually very busy sometimes requires long hours                                                                                                    2. I have learned to work with doctors, dieticians, social workers and team mates to provide safe and effective treatments to our patients."
good,Great educational opportunities for advancement.  Great bonuses available.  I wish I never left. 14 hour days are the only drawback.
good,"First is patient familiarity. You will see the same patients three to four times. This can be good. Of course you will learn about them; you can tell by looking at them if there is something acutely wrong. They will develop a trust relationship with you which you may not find with other venues where your patients rarely see you. "
good,"At DaVita I maintained office correspondence, patient check in, patient check out, operated office equipment, maintain patient charts and medical records."
good,good staff great benefits challenging at times overall a great place to work

The patients always talk about how much they enjoy being at DaVita and it makes you feel really great about what you're doing every day. "
good,I loved it here because the staff and patients built such a good relationship with each other. It was a comfortable environment.
good,If you are looking for a company striving to improve service delivery by leveraging technology this is the place. Very goal oriented and time line driven but not stuffy and impersonal.
good,the people always worked well with patients in order to get them the proper treatment needed to extend life.
good,A wonderful opportunity to learn about dialysis and the care of dialysis patients.
good,"Going to work should be a place that you want to go to daily and be able to help those who need it more than you! That's why I love being a nurse, if I am able to make at least 1 person feel better that day then I feel that I have accomplished my role of being a nurse/advocate."
good,"DaVita, Is a very large company, I had nothing but very positive feelings and a endless learning. I loved working for this company."
good,With this job you have an opportunity to teach patients about their disease. Instruct them how to live a good life with Renal Failure. We become a family inside the work place. As a nurse we work closely with doctors to improve patient outcomes. Fellow employees are known as teammates which further reinforces the family idea. The hardest part of the job is when we lose a patient. We all go through the grieving process.
good,You learn things all the time getting to know people is amazing the people that I have worked with has been great. Just knowing that I am helping someone is a complete satisfaction for me.
good,"nice company, dialysis was not for me! Recevied alot of education and it was a good job just stressful with all you had to learn!"
good,I really enjoyed my time with DaVita. Comensation is reasonable and benifits were great. Management as well as the RN's and Tech. were very good and had great experiance.

good,Great culture micro-managing Sr Leadership. Strong middle management. A strong connection to health care vision and cost management. IT is transforming and has cutting edge tech
good,"I worked an average of 60 hours a week for 5 years. after working a long day the day before, a patient fell on me.  Later that night. While lifting a 40 pound barrel, I realized I'd hurt my back.  I was finally released back to work after 3 years and 3 back surgeries.  They never tried to get me s job I could do.  My tip is, loyalty means nothing.  Don't volunteer for more hours than you NEED to work.  It won't get you anywhere."
good,I have been with the company for a year so far. This was my first nursing postition and it was a big adjustment. Dialysis is a diffrent type of nursing in which you have to really rely on great time management skills. If a person can not work in  fast paced environmen this job is not for them.
good,"I like what I do , I just want to take the opportunity to Enhance my skills and grow in the healthcare industry . I’m looking for something flexible and easy going ."
good,I love the company's core values and beliefs! They really offer a lot of benefits and resources. Very involved with employees and communities! Serious but Fun environment!

good,"DaVIta is a strong, stable employer.  Their culture is very positive and inspiring.   Work / life balance is an issue.  People are dedicated to a fault and do not respect after hours / family time.  If you can handle a very fast paced competitive work place and the management turnover that comes with such a large employer it is worth checking out!"
good,Davita is a great place to work. They have educational programs to advance each employee of their desire. Policies and Procedures are updated reguarly
good,"en un día típico de trabajo comienza con las carreras de producción de líquidos de diálisis como lo es el bicarbonato y el ácido para continuar con chequeo de la planta de agua y maquinas de diálisis y UCI donde se presta el servicio."
good,"Washing and putting away golf carts, making sure all bathrooms are cleaned, and providing customer service to all golfers coming out to play.  Coworkers were excellent to work with.  Management could have used better communication to talk and work with people in other positions.  The most enjoyable part was being out on the golf course working."

good,This was a great working area to go to in order for me to do my externship. There was great people and work environment.
good,"I love this job, but when new management came in, i was not a good fit. It was the patient the kept me that lovg. I would love to work in this field again"
good,Don't re-sign not unless you know someone that can get you back in the door.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,I interned at DaVita during my spring semester of my senior year in college. I was thoroughly trained and made comfortable before being thrown into my position. I was a Patient Account Specialist Intern in the Revenue Operations department. I collaborated with insurance companies to try and receive the money that was owed to DaVita. The working environment was very family oriented and the employees seemed very closely bonded.
good,"DaVita is a great place to work. You hard, the days are very long. You really have to love what you do to be successful. I started working with DaVita at 53 years of age. its for a young person to start."
good,"If it weren't for my direct supervisor, I would have stayed here forever!  It's so vital and important to ensure you have the right people in the right roles.  "
good,DaVita employs a great mix of teammates and they work together very well. Environment was collaborative and conducive to working with multiple depts..
good,The village believes in fun.  Management strategies can be a little strange but the firm emphasizes work/life balance and fun.  Benefits could stand to be improved too.
good,Early start time a lot of hours if you want them. The patients where great. The management was not good too many people you report to that all had different answers.
good,"Davita is not for the faint of heart. It takes a very strong person to work in this emotional patient environment. Davita has wonderful Benefits. But, the hours can be very long or very short due to patient ratios."
good,I worked here and had the opportunity to travel but I had to voluntarily leave the company due to the fact there was no balance between work and personal life. I had school and there was no time to do school while having this job.
good,Unfortunately there are no options in the shift work for me. I need to be able to get my children to school and daycare now that their father is out of the picture I can't rely on him anymore.
good,The company is nice and the pay is ok. There is no work life balance and the hours are ok. The culture is amazing. That is all
good,"I was just a volunteer here, but it was a great place to volunteer at. I would wheel the patients in, take their vitals, and just talk to them during their treatment. I learned a lot and had a great time doing it."
good,"I believe that Davita is one of not many places to work with a great culture, which comes down tangibly from the COO himself. Davita rally live what they believe on a daily basis."
good,"As a dialysis technician, more is required to facilitate 100% patient care in a timely manner. However, managerial turnover is less than two years. Work day is any time between 10 to 13 hours."
good,The nurses I work with are the best. If I was ever to be diagnosed with ESRD I would want the PD/HHD nurses to treat me. They care about their patients and work very long hours to make sure the patients needs are met. DaVita is a great place to work and I am rewarded every time I see the patients return to the clinic.
good,"Productive and fun workplace, with supportive coworkers and physicians. I had to learn how to deal with the billing dept that was out of state and make them understand Arizona guidelines with insurance. My coworker and I teamwork was outstanding until new management changed it and we started hearing more ""I"" then teamwork. New challenging were exciting."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Great work environment"
good,"Great company to work for. Supervisors and management values team mates feed back. Weekly team meetings with game ice breakers, always fun, different team mate ran the meetings every week. Supervisors and management would assist with month end billing when facilities were late getting reports in."
good,"I come in start to disinfect my machines, I line my machines for patient that is assigned to that seat, I gather all my paper work, dialyzer, and heparin for that patient, I prep my patient for cannualation, I began my sticking procedure, start machine and insert the perscribed treatment time in the computerto initiate treatment."
good,I worked here only a brief time and have been trying to get a position back.  See I was fired after about 4 months because I had surgery and had to have a month off due to it and was not eligible for FMLA.
good,"Tedious at times though some days will fly by. Co- worker are great except the few that are know- it -all's. The hardest part of the job is ""turn over"", when the 1st shift patients come of the machine and the 2nd shift go on. Over all the job as a whole is great."
good,Monitoring & Training patients on Dialysis. Always being professional and helping them in parts of their life when I can. Management and co-workers are good. the hardest part is standing all day. the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I am giving Life to my patients and I want them to be happy in what ever they do.
good,"get there at 5:30am trun on all machines, run test on all machines, hook up with stuff for that specific patient, monitor patients and take vitals at set intervals, disconnect patient and control bleeding, tear down machine, dispose of lines in boihazard, clean machine and retest for next patient.Learned how to run the dialysis machine. management was good but not strict enough. Co_Workers were good sometimes kind of lazy and you had to pick their slack. The hard part was controlling the bleeding of the patients and making it stop. Enjoyed getting to know the patients very well seeing them every other day."
good,"Teammates are really fun and great to work with. Difficult to advance within the company. Must like working with patients, staff and Doctors. Must be flexible and accept change."
good,"Davita/Healthcare Partners gave great training (co-workers provided the on-the-job-training) My co-workers were phenomenal and some of the management were very welcoming.  I often worried about job security due to the changes Healthcare Partners was going through, but all in all it was a good fit."
good,It was a great experience working at DaVita. I learned A LOT! I learned a different level of compassion and patience with people with life long health problems
good,"DaVita is overall a great company.  Much opportunity is available for extra hours if wanted with paid travel time,  My clinic administrator was awesome."
good,"A typical day at work is fifteen hours of non-stop activity. Constant flow of patients in a three shift day. I learned so much about kidney disease and it’s effects on a person in so many areas. Management works at being fair to staff and patients. They strive to do a great job. Workplace culture is one of a family feeling. You get to know your patients and their families pretty well. The hardest part of the job is saying goodbye to a patient for whom you may have cared for many years."
good,Great company with patient care and satisfied teammates is an important goal. Keeps up with state and federal regulations. Believes in a pleasant workplace physically. Works hard to provide a friendly and safe place for pts also.
good,I have worked for DaVita for many years and I get great fulfillment from what I do as a PCT.  I enjoy seeing and spending time with my patients and their families.  I feel that DaVita spends exuberant amount of time trying to promote nurses without looking into other staff for advancement options.
good,Management is the same as anywhere else. I personally love dialysis so this is the best dialysis company i’ve Worked for. Fair hours. Better life work balance than acute dialysis.
good,Dealing with the same sick people every week is difficult at times. Staff and management are very encouraging to further education. Starting at 4am is difficult.
good,"Davita is a lovely company to work for. I just don't agree with the pay. Working with patients and universal culture is heart warming, that's why I do it. To help people."
good,"I have a very busy work day as my role is extensive.  I have learned  and gained an extreme amount of experience in nursing, management, business and education."
good,Great place to work and learn. Management listens to staff and assists as needed. It's a huge company but salary is not as competitive in comparison to other companies of the same job position.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"Dialysis is hard work, but working for DaVita makes the hard work fulfilling.  The culture is like no other, and core values are in alignment with beliefs."
good,"Supportive management, many benefits offered, flexible schedule, growth and advancement available, community events and participation available, and continuous relationships with the patients."
good,Love my job! I travel to different hospitals where I perform dialysis on acute & chronic patients.. A typical day ends when the patients end. It could range from a 2 hour day to a 16 hour day. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to see the patients health improve because of performing dialysis on them. The hardest part of my job would be the on call hours.
good,"In acute HD you may start your day at 6am, and end at midnight. It has proven to be the most difficult place to work in just because of the unknown length of work day. This has proven to be most undesirable for me and that is why I have decided to look within the village for other employment options that will be a better fit to make a more harmonious work and life balance."
good,Long days starting at 5:45am ending at 6pm in the evening. Able to interact with patients on a constant and positive level. Able to provide services to enhance the quality of life for the patient.
good,"DaVita is by far one of the best companies I have ever worked for. The drive and motivation to help patients is clear, and the atmosphere and culture are above and beyond what I have seen anywhere else. DaVita refers to itself as a ""Village"" rather than a company, and this is made clear in the respect and caring that I've seen both in upper management and teammates. "
good,"At DaVita, I support Registered Nurses in providing care to individuals who have Chronic Kidney Disease and End Stage Renal Disease as they transition in and out of dialysis treatment."
good,"I work mornings. Start the morning setting up machines by, checking the rinse, stringing and testing machines to prepare them for patients arrivals. Getting unit and treatment floor set from the water room to the treatment floor to start dialysis for that day."
good,"I came in when they were understaffed so I got under trained so I could get on the floor and help. The hours are long, and the job overall is stressful. The sense of entitlement makes it worth it."
good,"The company, DaVita, is an incredible company to work for with excellent core values.  Morality was always a focus on keeping higher.  I would have stayed with this company longer if they had not eliminated the department.  Unfortunately, downsizing happens, even in the best companies."
good,"I loved working for DaVita, in fact I would still be there if there was a branch here in Bloomington. I loved their values and work ethic. They believed in teamwork."
good,"A typical work day is simply repetitious. I've learned a lot concerning the human body and its fuctions to different medical levels. The management team were often short shifted due to running and maintaining more than one facility at a time. The co-workers had to work together as a team in order to save lives. The hardest part of this job is caring for and building a beautiful relationship with your patient, then losing them to heart failure, high blood pressure, or any other medical illnesses."
good,Davita is a great company to work for! The main goal is providing excellent patient care. For a patient care tech it is very hard work and long hours. It is a job that I love and a company that I love also. The most rewarding part of working in an in center hemodialysis center is knowing that I have helped someone live a healthier today.
good,I really enjoyed the TEAM mentality of the organization and I looked forward to a day working with my TEAMmates.
good,"DaVita Labs is a great place to work. Great Core Values, great Mission and Vision. They do what they say and say what they do. But in the recent past, they have become more top heavy and hence there are too many Chiefs and not enough Indians."
good,"Awesome dialysis company catering their physicians, patients and employees. Culture is relaxed and fun, while maintaining professional. Wages are not as competitive, however it is a great place to work especially if you want to be a part of an organization that is truly out to help people with their healthcare needs."
good,"DaVita is a great place to work. They live the Core Values and put the patients first! The leadership has high expectations of themselves and of their teams, which has helped me develop into a strong leader who is able to receive feedback and improve."
good,"Great company, job stability. Forces you to learn and be a contributor. Management very knowledgeable, not just pencil pushers and decision makers...very involved."
good,Great company to work for. Nice people willing to help at any time. Great training
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Prominent in the community. Growth available. Pay could be better. Great exposure. Stock option available. Flexible hours. Overtime available. Pay could be better.
good,Davita is the perfect place to work if you love work with people. It's a fast place job but rewarding Job. Good benefits and bonuses. You have to hook patients to the machine.
good,I worked as acute RN at Davita in the hospitals and my days and hours were flexible. We did different dialysis modalities and it was a great opportunity for me.
good,Davita is a team environment .  Because it’s a fortune 500 company Davita is worldwide .  You are able to transfer from one facility to another one state to another one of the best companies I’ve worked for .....
good,"Excellent culture, committed to quality patient care, workiing hard to improve nursing culture. Pay is fair but not best. Many non medical leaders offer mix of talent."
good,"Loved my job and now trying to get back on davita. I loved my team and great team work, whenever i had a question i got an answer. Also you can move your way up in this company.. all in all a great opportunity for a great carrier."
good,Great place to work! DaVita has a culture that enables teammates to grow and use their skills to make a difference in the marketplace. Highly engaging and Great team environment!
good,In my 20+ years of my career DaVita is the FIRST company who is truly invested in their employee's personal and professional growth. DaVita is also the first healthcare company whose focus is completely on the patient in all areas of the company in direct and non-direct patient care departments. At DaVita you are not identified as an employee number or just a body sitting at a desk. Every person is valued!
good,"I love DaVita as a company, it’s going to be hard for any other company to compare. However, I cannot drive 1.5 hours one way to work at 3am. It’s unsafe for me."
good,"The work was very enjoyable."
good,"This was a great place to work with a fun culture and atmosphere, but they paid low and benefits are very expensive (i.e. health insurance). Also, corporate likes to do layoffs every couple of years."
good,"Overall, they provide me with flexible hours to attend college full time, but there is a lot of issues with management and favoritism. Which is why I wish to look elsewhere."
good,I've worked at many companies and my experience here exceeds those in almost all ways. When considering tradeoffs it beats all of them. I would highly recommend Davita to folks looking to get GM experience at the single or multi-site level.
good,Helping another person LIVE gives me life as well as them. I loved every opportunity with DaVita. Just the times don’t match up with family needs and children.
good,"DaVita was truly an amazing place to work. They truly cared for their associates and took really good care of them. They were constantly thowing parties and events, doing potlucks etc. It was wonderful."
good,Davita an awesome company to work for fortune 500 company. Great prople to work with if you have the management that are positive and willing to create the best atmosphere and positive energy.
good,"IF you believe in the mission and values of this company, you will feel rewarded.  The job itself as a Technician was rewarding; requires good boundaries- be personable but professional."
good,I have been with Davita for almost 8 years. Training is excellent and opportunities to grow is always there. It is difficult to leave the company If you are under the right management.
good,It is a good company to work for. Help with school tuition. Good job to enter the healthcare field. Offers good benefits. Team-oriented culture (depending on the clinic you work at).
good,"Davita is a great place to work, however the work life balance is terrible, the hrs tend to be anywhere from 12-14 per day. Very fast paced environment.  You have a 1 to 5 ratio, so makes for a challenging day at times."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,What I enjoy the most that it is team work & they are lovable people I also love what I do I’m helping someone out by saving the life davita also is a great company to work for
good,"I enjoy working with the public and DaVita has afforded me the opportunity to learn and exercise my AA skills as well as health care skills in helping to promote excellent  patient care. I schedule there outside appointments, get reports form other medical providers, as well as scheduling any medical test. I host homeroom meetings to help keep teammates informed of new patient starts as well as other information. I set up learning tools to keep teammates up on recertification's. I am a team player who jumps in when needed to, I love working with a team who knows that a smile on your face helps to promote quality care and ease any problems you encounter on any given day."
good,I enjoy the culture and staff. Management is great. I've learned key skills specific to my job. I would like to see more opportunities for growth and advancement.
good,"Fun work place. However, the pays is low. This is a great place to start out if you are fresh from college. Management tends to promote within the office 700+ staff members. This is to say that the competition is tight."
good,Great place to work at! very dedicated staff. Management always ready  to help. open door policy. The facility where I am at is a family environment. Everyone is always ready to help.
good,"RN's, PCT's, SW, RD, and MD's working in collaboration for best patient outcomes.  Fast paced environment where critical thinking and ""on your toes"" mindset is needed.   Multitasking and organizaton is required to complete all tasks assigned."
good,"pay rate is terrible and you are sent home. Manager has to many favorites that she allowed to do complete hours and overtime no set schedule, poor health benefits"
good,Very 1st management position after many years of acute dialysis services.  The best staff I've ever had in 30 years - manager at the time was nice but weak on patient care issues - Still it was my favorite management position where I learned the most and made the most mistakes.
good,Same question ...17 characters.It's kind of ridiculous that everything on the previous page was option and now I'm having to deal with required fields AND character limits. Come on ...
good,"take vital sing ,monitor pts during tx and after tx make appoit for tx "
good,"Love working for the company, typical day at work was Fun, learned a lot, management was great, work culture was great. I really didn't have a hard job."
good,"Challenging to keep up with guidelines that are constantly changing."
good,"As an intern, I was welcomed onto the team and made to feel at home immediately. I had a great experience, not just with the dietitian (which was my area of study), but with the whole interdisciplinary team."
good,. Enjoy fast paced quick decisions. It is long hours up to 21 hrs in a day then come in a start again in the morning.  This could be a plus but also works against you.  You work until the job in done.  There are only 24 hrs in a day and you could be at the hospital until the work is done for the day.
good,I overall learned a lot working for Davita. I liked that Davita was patient satisfaction driven but that they also ccared for the staff. I really felt like I worked really hard. I sometimes worked 15-16 hour shifts and was exhausted afterwards. Team work is important to the company and I'm glad that it was instilled in most of the team that I worked with.
good,I enjoyed working at DaVita it was a great job learned a lot but most importantly I loved the family atmosphere. We were considered teammates which made us all feel as a whole.
good,DaVita is a great company to work for.  They have a strong commitment to provide service excellence to their patients as well as their partners.  They have a unique culture that truly shows care and commitment to their teammates and their teammates families.
good,You are constantly learning something new from your co-workers to improve upon your duties.  Management is highly involved and strives on making a balance between work and home.
good,"I love working for Davita, Davita gave me the experience that I needed and for that am forever grateful for the opportunity, I have work in 4 Davita unit three where just per-diem helping out when They where short staff and I must say every clinic is different but I fit in every where I go and was welcome by staff and teammates."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"I obtained a great deal of experience while working here. Proceeding my employment with DaVita, I was able to obtain a position with Physicians Dialysis Home Program. I work independently as a CCHT."
good,great company to work with. challenging but very fast paced. most enjoyable  part is getting to know who your patients are and their stories about daily life.
good,"Connect and disconnect patient from machine, and monitor during treatment. "
good,"A typical day at work is rewarding and challenging. Everyday at work, I learn how to have and show compassion to my patients. Management tries its best to work with you. Majority of my co-workers including myself demonstrates DaVita's Core Values that make going to work worth while. The hardest part of my job is trying to relate to patients the importance of compliance without coming off as their mother. The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with patients, laughing, talking and getting to know each patient in order to better serve the patients."
good,"Wonderful place to work, wonderful people and experience. The best Doctor and physician assistant I have met to date."
good,"co-workers have been fun to work with."

good,Excellent training resources and materials to equip employees
good,was a very fun and professional place to work. i learned alot about how dialysis really worked. management was really good. everyone was really nice treated with respect. the most enjoyable part of the job was talking with the paitents and getting to know them.
good,Great place to work. Knowledgeable people and they respect their employees.
good,Great company and core values. Some departments will work you to death
good,A typical day work day includes managing several projects depending on needs.
good,Making sure every patient was schedule for proper and timely dialysis treatment was my daily work goal!
good,"This company requires a very driven person. Not that it is a bad thing, its just that the job demands it. Timeframes can be unrealistic, and that makes for a very hard day."
good,DaVita is a great company to work for. There's not much room for advancement if you're looking to move up the ladder into a higher position. If you're comfortable in your current job this is the place to work.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience

good,I love thattbhe fact everyone is like family and that when going into work its not a job you feel like im hear for an pay check but actually helping save people lives.
good,I love working for Davita! The job requires team work throughout the day. If you have a strong team then that makes for a great day. The turnover rate is high and this job is not for everyone. There are times when we have to work harder because of short staff. The thing that I love most about my job is that I can assist at other clinics if I want overtime.
good,Love being pct and role of hemodialysis tech. Fun training  and great preceptors. Great patients fun tasks rewarding responsibilities with great nursing stadf
good,Davita's on boarding was exceptional and the manager was hands on and engaged in your learning and training.  The team of biomedical maintenance personal in the area were engaged great trainers and really loved the job and the company.  I looked forward to working there everyday and regretted moving on to other opportunities.
good,"I cannot say enough good things about DaVita, when they mention the village, they mean it! They truly care and look after their employees. You will always have competition between employees, but it was never allowed to interfere with patient care."
good,"Is a good place to work and to grow, as Lon you are willing to work hard and as a team , you will have a great future. Has long you fallow the protocol and the policy. Be on time and treat patients with respect and dignity. You will be a lifetime employee"
good,"I had the pleasure of working both clinical and administrative for this company. Clinical was not the best, but, the administrative side was amazing. Both had issues with being understaffed and not being proactive enough in preventing under-staffing issues."
good,DaVita is the 4th corporate entity in the clinics I work in and is a solid organization providing adequate reimbursement and benefits. Each clinic is somewhat different and I feel competent and valued.
good,It was a great place to work. Had a great coworkers who were always willing to help each other to meet a group goal. There was a great work culture and felt like I belonged and was accepted.
good,"Worked two years, loved it. Learned a lot and had very busy, variety filled job. Coworkers were nice and helpful. Loved working with newly in boarded nurses. Training was phenomenal. Great culture."

good,Dialysis it will always be a part of my life it's what helped structure me to be the nurse that I am today they provided an opportunity things to learn about the beauty of Nursing
good,"Overall I like working for davita been with them for 10 years and still going, hopefully working on going back to school to be a nurse. Davita is a great company to work, specially the clinic where I work."
good,DeVita was a great place for an Externship whoever it was not a fit for me. I didn't like to work with deadlines that needed to be done in two hours it seemed to me that they waited until the last minute to get things done. For the employees there was mandatory over time. They had great benefits and incentives and awesome team building programs
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Always looking how to improve a pt's life and still considering how to help balance the teammates lives as well.  Mission and values are posted all over and are true to the T.  Co-workers are usually very kind and a well rounded group of individuals.  Management takes a good hard look at whom they're hiring.
good,"12hour shifts,great benefits,managment very supportive,hardestv part of the job is the very sick patients,Dialysis work is very strenuous and exhausting"
good,even though i had a few issues with my managment team and on boarding process (which is rare). I think the company is a great company to work for. If you happen to be unhappy with you positions they offer oppertunies to apply to open positions in other departments  or clinics. and if you are not sure if its something you want or can handle they allow you to set up a job shadow oppertunity. DaVita also takes time to volunteer in the community as teams which i think is wonderful. But to get hired .. it does help to know someone on the inside
good,"The job is very hard and your time will be normally at work, long work hours, very high paced, worth it because of the patients and the family you develop working there."
good,The pay was good. The Benefits were good.We had a good strong team that communicated well and worked well together. The co-workers had good attitudes and were professional and happy to be there.  It was a positive supportive and fun atmosphere.
good,"Some positions need to be re-evaluated concerning pay vs workload, but for the most part this was the most rewarding job I have ever had.  The culture was amazing and I just loved everyone I worked with in the entire region."
good,"I have no review to write.  I feel that all opinion are different. along with every experience is different.  All clinic have different energy because the FA run their facilities differently,"
good,"The strong focus on patients is very fulfilling.  It is a very 'global' company, with teammates interacting and connecting telephonically.  Fast paced."
good,This is a great company to work for and i would look forward to working with them again when I move back to Nevada...................................................
good,"My supervisor was amazing. She was down to earth, never lost her cool, and was always able to help. Even the patients were awesome. They didn't give a hard time and were very friendly."
good,I have worked here for 5 years now and its a good place to work. Pay is low and raises are terrible but other than that the culture is great. They have a good work/life balance.
good,"Working for DaVita at home is a flexible job that is very heavy in the office and light on direct patient care. DaVita has very high standards and strict tactics for evaluating the clinics successfulness, which does not always reflect the care being provided."
good,"Great company to work for! They really put their patients and teammates first. Living the motto ""A Community First, Company Second""."
good,"Commitment to excellence and continuous improvement is going to involve goals, metrics, and getting stuff done."
good,DaVita is a wonderful place to work they send you and a paid trip to the DaVita Academy to learn more about the company and they also send you to Preceptor University paid trip also to become a teacher to teach Dialysis to new employees the company have unit outings with your co workers and we just over all have fun as a unit

good,Patient quality care. The company goes the extra mile to provide excellent patient care. just typing words because i have to type more wwords to move on
good,Everyday is a different day.  Each day face with different tasks and challenges which i truly enjoy. Best part of my job is teaching my patients how to take charge of their health.
good,There were travel and lunches and a nice place to work I just wanted to work closer to home.I would work there is the pay was more the benefits were reasonable
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Davita is a highly qualified center for patient care that always strives to go the extra mile for their patients. This facility helped me grow as a nurse and as an individual.
good,So much to learn in this company and such a great opportunity for growth. Company does offer tuition reimbursement.  Company offers great training from the start.
good,"I loved working for DaVita!  My team and co-workers were the best and so much fun to work with.  The patients are wonderful.   I learned so much about Kidney dialysis and Nephrology.  "
good,Always promoting growth- achievement - and a great atmosphere for employees and patients.  In this area there is a lack of skilled nurses and techs in the float pool.
good,a day at davita was working with good teammates.  long hours but ability to take care of our patients and work with good teammates.
good,"Its a great company in many ways. There's room for growth and good work. They offer excellent training. A typical day at work is long and challenging; sometimes discouraging; sometimes inspiring. The immediate management are manageable. The upper management are all about the bottom line, not the well-being of the humans. The clinics are run well, but chronically short staffed making it difficult to want to stay, causing quite a bit of turn-around. The upper management say they're working on it, but there hasn't been any real change."
good,"I had never done dialysis before and the staff came together to teach me all they could.  Fast paced work environment. Had two patients at a time, worked in team environment. Patients appreciate the work staff does and you make a difference in peoples lives. Some times it is really busy and sometimes there is no work at all.  Management does listen to you and works with you to accommodate your needs. Co-workers were very knowledgeable about the work and encouraged me throughout my time with them."
good,Come in and take care of daily task knowing that you are helping someone live longer and stronger. This company has helped my development very much.
good,I have been a CCHT for 16yrs. I continue to learn and grow in this profession. The kidneys and how they function in conjunction with daily living is exciting to learn about and teach out patients.
good,Typical day at work is stressful and chaotic but overall its apart of the job . I enjoyed patient care I enjoy educating my patients as well.
good,"Davita is a very good company that is committed to patient care and excellence in outcomes.  "
good,"Great company and a lot of fun people to work with. A lot of work, but work hard play harder. I would recommend DaVita to anyone."
good,"Ive learned how to use needles, mixed acid also stop a lot of medical supplies. I started in inventory worked my way up to reuse witch i cleaned blood. Then i moved to pct witch is patient care technician. Learned how to stick patents deal with patents and learned a lot about medicine."
good,"I love working for Davita and I would not leave except for the cut in hours. My Administrator is great as our leader. Our team seems to work well together in spite of hectic hard days."
good,"Very diverse, family oriented, and professional. Will discuss my review during an interview. I have not worked for this company in over 6 years. I will discuss what I remember from my experience as an employee with DaVita during my interview."
good,"Great place to work.  Patient and team oriented."
good,I loved working with my patients. I have learned how to handle people who are sick I worked with the elderly. The hardest part of my day to day there was the fact that at any given moment we can have a medical emergency and lose some one.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Very nice co-workers that are keen to answer any questions you may have.  Enjoyed helping around the office and meeting the patients.  Everyone seems to really care about the patients.
good,"My day usually starts by opening the unit at 4:00 A.M. followed by getting the water room up and running by mixing the bicarbonate for the patients machines, sitting up the machines in 15 stations and getting ready for the patients to enter the door at 5:30.  The first out of 4 patients I will be taking care of go on at 5:30. I then initiate the first treatment, monitoring vital signs and documenting all patient information in the computer. I then go on to do the next 3 patients on the first shift. I have a minimum of 10-12 patients I take care of on a Daily bases. Once a patients treatment is completed I pull needles and terminate their treatment and set the machine up for the next patient. Then for each pod of stations we have we have side duties that we need to preform each day. Since DaVita has bought our company I have learned a lot of new policies and procedures. Management and co-workers are fun to work with and the are all team players and I work well with them all. The hardest part of my job is trying not to get involved and close to the patients. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I make a difference in our patients life and I am giving them the chance of living a longer life."
good,i only worked there for a month for internship. They had alot of fun there with events
good,Interaction with peers and patients was relaxed with a degree of formality for area of nursing. Hard part was on your feet 10-12 hours without gel pads for comfort at work station standing computers. The patients made you look forward to what you have and always thankful for your time.
good,"DaVita Healthcare Partners, Inc. is one of the largest kidney care companies in the United States, with corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado. Their offerings include in-center hemodialysis, in-center nocturnal dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, home hemodialysis, vascular access management, chronic kidney disease education, and renal diet assistance.Nice staff and enjoyed working here"
good,Davita has a lot of online learning.so you can excel at the company.
good,I love and respect each and everyone I work with patients and co workers we are all family. we all have a good time at work and enjoy each day we all are together. patients included .
good,The company was great to work for and provided an excellent opportunity to further my experience under the Insurance Claims processing portion of the Medical billing field.
good,Externship so no pay.  Answering phone.  Helped with Administrative duties.  Organized medical records.  Enjoyed co-workers.  Enjoyed helping patients.
good,"Each day I go to work wondering what the day will bring. The patients and other teammates always have a great time together to make the best out of an unpleasant situation. We start our days getting set up for the first shift of patients waiting outside the doors. As much as we try to be upbeat and make the patients happy it can be hard to see them not feeling well, but the hardest part is finding out we have lost one of our patients. I love what I do and remind myself each day that I decided to do this for a living my patients did not ask to be there and would rather do anything else. We need to keep that in mind when we are having a hard day."
good,"Work 10-12 hour shifts, Patients are great, Learn a lot about dialysis and healthcare. Love working for Davita. I would recommend anyone to work for this company"
good,"A typical day at davita  starts at 4:45 am and ends at 7:00pm, with a 3 patient to 1 technician ratio averaging to 9 patients a day. I learned so much about customer service and being independant and able to complete task with deadlines. I would also say that punctuality and time management is very important in this career field. With the days being so long it is also good to have great teammates and being a team player myself."
good,Great place to work.  The culture here is probably the most unique.  Make sure you really live and breathe the core values.
good,training program is set-up poorly. great future if trained by certified trrainers
good,Fortune 500 Company great company to work for. Family oriented company
good,"Very fun place to work, excellent co-workers, that help alot."
good,"Great place to work, fast paced, lots to learn and do"
good,Its a very rewarding place to work for. The managers really care and the pay is pretty good. I have been with the company for 4 years and I must say that I enjoy it.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,I love working here....I just feel that the pay isnt as good as it should be for the work you are expected to do. The hours are not very convenient but the management is very understanding and will work with you.
good,The pay is not good for the experience. The benefits are good  and it is flexible with your school schedule...The patients seem to be happy for the most part
good,I love working for DaVita. what they lack in hourly wage they make up for with tm activities. I have flexibility with a living wage. Your career here is based more so on who you know rather than what you know . Make friends in high places and do and do a decent job and you are all set.
good,DaVita is a fun place to work. There is a real sense of mission. I am able to work remotely 2 to 3 days a week. Management style is relaxed and supportive.
good,Management. Teammates and ability to work remotely is the best part about working at DaVita. Company events are great too. The company benefits are inline with other companies.
good,Working for Davita was one of the best jobs I had.  I enjoyed the type of work I was doing there.  If they offered that position where I live now I would certainly apply for it.
good,"Love my job plenty of room for advancement . Tuition reimbursement and plenty of trained techs to help you along the way!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"This is a great place to work for new graduate registered nurses.  I was working as a Patient Care Technician, as I studied to pass my Boards to be a Registered Nurse.  Flexible hours, with overtime.  Great benefits if you have a small family.  Career advancement opportunities and special benefits for education and further career development."
good,"I currently work at Davita and love the culture of management. It can be challenging at times, but I have support from management and other teammates. The pay is competitive."
good,"Flexible work hours from 730-9 to 4-5."
good,Long shifts 12-15 hours a day. Had many times staffed worked short. In order to work here personally you have to be very committed to waking up early and coming in on days off due to techs calling in or not showing up. Also Must be able to deal with stress well and not be afraid of needle sticks or blood in sight. Patient care is important as well as infection control.
good,Fun is in the core values but not all clinics experience this core value firsthand. Its hard for management to free themselves of employees that do not contribute to this value.
good,They definitely have a good culture at this company that centers around helping each other and being the best person you can be to help patients and other teammates.
good,"Set up for patient care, get your assignments."
good,"It’s a great job, if you enjoy early mornings and long days. I enjoy DaVita, but I’ve realized that Dialysis isn’t my strong point. It helped educate me and give me a glimpse of the Dialysis world."
good,"Great management,great benefits and salary as well as 401K matching program. Fast paced but manageable.  Yearly evaluations with salary increases. Appreciate when you go the extra mile and help out."
good,It was a very fun environment to work in. I like my coworkers and getting to know the patients. The doctors would provide lunches that were awesome. Listening to music was always soothing while working.
good,"Learned a lot work In at Davita"
good,"A typical day at Davita normally started between 4:30 am and 5:00 am, depending on the clinic. I learned how to draw blood for blood cultures, I also learned to show more appreciation for my health. The hardest part of the job was potentially losing a patient that you had connected with. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I had kept someone alive for another day."
good,"Very good environment to work in. The teammates and patients make the entire davita experience worth it. Even on bad days, coming to work can actually make the day go right."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Very fun to work at. Belives in our community first before the company bottom line. Mission and core vaules are followed to the t. Opportunity for advancements.
good,Davita is good place to work for especially if you have the energy for the 12-15 hour shifts. Once you get adjusted to the long shifts the clinic becomes a educational environment. Everyday you learn new and exciting things about kidney treatments and how it effects each patient differently. Davita's has a family oriented environment which gives the PCT's the ability to learn how the treatments effect the patients body and to provide quality patient care.
good,DaVita was a very fast-paced job and you never had to worry about having enough work.  There were special projects we would get to work on and the employees were wonderful.
good,"Working in the dialysis field can be quite stressful, and sometimes the hours are long. But the feeling you get from helping people in need is welcome."

good,The people there where very helpful and inviting. There was qualifications i have to pass in order to graduate and they were very helpful in making sure i got all of them.
good,"I loved interning at Davita. It is a place where you can take what you learned in school and focus on different aspects to improve your working knowledge of the processes needed to bill and code correctly."
good,"To effectively succeed in this company you would have to have a strong regard for compassion and empathy for others.  The call volume is high, however there is no AHT metric, which means you don't have to manage you call handle time with patients."
good,Aweome place to work if you want to feel like you are a part of something bigger. Leadership is engaged and concerned with the thoughts and suggestions of their employees.
good,"Team is an important word at DaVita and it shows. I'm looking for more of an Educator role, hopefully within DaVita. There is an environment of frugality that sometimes hinders a more pleasant less fast paced work environment. for example if there is a call out, there wont be a replacement of the teammate, rather the team is expected to absorb the extra work ."
good,I loved my job had a lot of laughs team support and most of the patients made it rewarding. the down side is watching their health fail slowly and sometimes very rapid.Sometimes one simple cough ends in death and your left with grieving patients and or co-workers.
good,"Davita Dialysis was a great company to work for, I just decided to go back and continue with my education. They provided great benefits and the training was very helpful."
good,"Great culture"

good,"Your work day is very fast paced, and this is consistent throughout the entirety of your day. Company is very patient and employee centered, making it an enjoyable company to be employed with. The company allows multiple benefits for employees that may be desirable to a variety of individuals."
good,"When I applied at DaVita I went through many rounds of interviews.  They decided I was not the best fit for the role for which I applied, but they took the time to match me to another position which was a better fit for me.  The work is face-paced but so rewarding.  The culture of 'All for one and one for all' is amazing and supportive.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to network with all levels of teammates.  DaVita has ""FUN"" as one of its core values and it is a great place to work!"
good,Overall a great group of people who try very hard to help each other and their patients. Very fast paced clinics with very little down time if any. you might lose weight working dialysis
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Everyday I clock in 7.30am and clock out 6pm. Work with patients and other team member to bring about healthy life. There was a balance in the culture and respected by individual. the hardest part is that some patient can be tough.
good,A typical day at work would consist of providing care to dialysis patients. Cannulating access and monitoring vital signs.  The hardest part of the job for me is losing a patient and the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to give back to my patients in a way that fosters optimal care.
good,This was my first job in the health industry as a Medical Receptionist. I learned about insurances and different procedures they do on a every day basis. Very nice place to work.
good,"Davita is a great place to work. Their core values are exactly like I am, They care about the pt. and we are family. I have always been good with people, but Davita made it even more fun. The bond I have with the patients and their families is one of a kind. I love Davitas culture family. The hardest part of my job is when I get that call that one of our patients has passed. Davita is a renal pharmacy so we have to deal with this daily. What makes it easy is when you get that call and the pt. says they had a transplant. Even though you really like helping the pts, it's also nice to know they can move on with a great shot at life."
good,"Working for DaVita has been an awesome experience. It is an excellent introduction into the world of office administration, data entry, and career advancement opportunities."
good,Amazing place to work. The environment is focused on teammates and how can they grow and contribute. I was given a lot room to expand my knowledge and able to create resources in every department. Upper management is very approachable.
good,"This company has an amazing culture and highly competent staff. They have a great practice and even though they are large, executive leadership is very active and approachable."
good,"Employees need to be ready to work in a fast paced environment. Management micro manages A LOT. The teams are amazing because everyone is willing to help, but there is a lot of work, so better be ready to know how to multitask."
good,"Nothing special.  It is only a simple and good job.  All the collegues are very good and co operative.  Managers too are very good and polite.  Salary was given in time.  Everybody at Davita were like a family and had fun at times.  It was a good experience at Davita.  Unfortunately, the unit was to be shifted under care of another Hospital where there are already some duty doctors and my services were not so important there, the managers say.  Moreover I was asked to work under the new management of the other hospital which was not ok for me.  If I was offered a job under Davita management, I would not have any problems.  It is unfortunate to leave Davita."
good,Very awesome place to work. The days went by fast due to the busy workload. Everyone was extremely nice and the building was amazing. I would definitely recommend this employer to anyone that's trying to be in the medical billing or A/R field. The training class is very thorough and they make sure you understand the work.
good,This is a great company that really has wonderful standards and follows them.  7 core values that include fun.  Not too many jobs out there that provide fun!! This company is one of the best I've ever worked for.
good,"It's an excellent health care services and patients are very happy our service,im also happy to work in dialysis unit i like to care the patients like my parents"
good,The work load is stiff.  90-130 patients at a time.  I did field and telephonic case management.  I had a really good manager and our team was good at working together.
good,"Good working environment where you feel like you are making a difference in others lives. I feel appreciated by coworkers and my superiors, we are encouraged to strive for excellence."
good,The job was demanding but was filled with loving people. The patients was always happy to see the technicians. I would love to work there as an actual technician
good,"Working with a team of 30+ nurses on a daily bases.  Coordinating multiple hospitals needs.  "
good,"I enjoy working everyday, and I deal with a new day as if I am just starting my job today, to keep me going and motivate. As well as, to encourage other members of the team to cooperate and do their best."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team to deliver quality care to patients. Also, the opportunity to develop relationships between the patients is very rewarding. "
good,"Excellent people all around!  Exciting and fun!  The company's ""Teammates"" as we're called, are truly one for all and all for one.  A problem that may arise with a Teammate that directly impacts the Teammate's job, impacts everyone at the facility.  Just last night we sat around and brainstormed about problem that would affect the whole facility.  We were all engaged in dealing with the dilemma until it was resolved."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"The culture is fun, team-oriented and hard working! Employees enjoy a diverse culture and interface with various teams in order to accomplish goals and complete projects. Everyone is a hard worker, and the rewards can be great - promotions and fun events are just a few incentives offered to employees."

good,"Strong leadership team, Positive company culture, Strong training programs, nice coworkers; organized work flows, collaborative environment"
good,Davita Dialysis Center is where I completed my internship. I really enjoyed my time there and learned a wealth of knowledge. I got a chance to build relationships with the patients and serve them with excellence. The staff at Davita welcomed me with open arms and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was after building relationships with the patients and they die. That was very hard cope with at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was servicing the patients and making a difference in their life.
good,"The culture is the best thing, that this job has to offer, I enjoyed my time there. Great Benefits. Managment changed alot when I was there, this may not be the case any more."
good,"Great company culture,mission and vision."
good,you get to see the same clients over and over so it promotes a sense of trust. since it is a job of repetition you get used to the work fairly quickly and it almost becomes second nature.
good,At DaVita I was a Patient Care Technician.  I learned what kidney dialysis was and how to clean a persons kidney giving them extra life.  I loved working here and enjoyed working the 65 hours a week.
good,A typical day starts at 4-4:30 a.m. with two techs. I've learn to first have patients with our patients. And all the skills it takes to be a good tech. My co-workers are all hard workers and good team players. The hardest part of the job are the long hours and being on our feet from sun up to almost sun down.The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing the every day your saving someone life.
good,"great start of my career great place to start of a dialysis career, education is excellent"
good,"Toughest part of job is reviewing managed care contracts to establish if account was indeed paid correctly and according to contract, Davita is all over the United States so contracts vary from state to state and vendor also."
good,My typical day consisted of processing all leases for all new dialysis facilities throughout the United States.  Was able to attend Real Estate classes and obtained my State of California Real Estate Salesperson license.  Management was extraordinaire and co-workers were very nice.  This company is a very professional organization.  The hardest part of the job was proof-reading all documentation prior to be distributed.  And the most enjoyable was finding affordable housing for visiting employees.
good,I have worked for davita since 2008. I really enjoy the benefits and room for growth within the company. They are patient care focused which  speaks mounds about the standards of care.
good,"A typical day would consist of multiple tasks, could be very hectic at times but overall would always come together in the end. I learned a lot about kidney disease and dialysis patients. The hardest part of my job was getting to know people who lived everyday like it could be their last. Getting to work with these same people everyday also was the most enjoyable part of my job, knowing you are helping someone to feel better and get through another day."
good,I was given the opportunity to work independently and gained  invaluable knowledge with all aspects of the business.  
good,Davita has the best equipment and really focuses on the training of their employees.
good,Handle blood all day long. Sanitize dialysis equipment. Draw blood for lab testing.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"We are a community base company that stress work life balance.  The management is very down to earth and listens to you if you have any concerns.  This is even for the executive level."
good,It  was a great feeling  helping others for me when I worked at Davita.  The team I worked with was awesome . Great supervisors. Great Benefits.. I enjoyed it greatly
good,This company is all about the staff! They show the appreciation by bonuses and catered lunch. Always telling you what a great job you are doing. Management will come work the floor with you. Encourage and be positive for the future.
good,"DaVita has a very up front and honest culture devoted to the core values.  In fact, they are so devoted to it that they send many employees to a 2 day training on the culture and why it makes DaVita a great place to work.  I had the luxury of going to this ""Academy"", and I definitely found value in it."
good,I really felt like I was appreciated and given information to accel within the company. I have worked for other dialysis companies in 13 years and DaVita was by far the best choice. So many opportunities to go further in the company. I have been very happy being part of the Village
good,"This job is not for everyone to be honest. Mental stress is very high. But other than that, the hours are decent, employees are treated well, and co-workers were always fun to be around. "
good,This is a highly reputable company to work for. I'm speaking here about acute dialysis and not a chronic outpatient center only. A typical day can be very unpredictable and can change hour by hour. It definitely requires flexibility. Management is superb from the bottom all the way up to the CEO. They foster and provide unlimited learning opportunity's. The hardest part of this job for me was working mostly with depressed people which many renal failure patients tend to be. The most rewarding part of this job was working with an outstanding manager and a group of teammates of the highest professional caliber. They were team players mostly and had a willingness to go the extra mile to care for and help their teammates. This is a love or hate it area of nursing but Davita goes to great lengths to provide a love it experience.
good,Davita has allowed me to see Healthcare in a different perspective which I love. I was able to be face to face with patients. Learn about the different types of conflicts that I one day plan to fix.
good,"We truly strive to care for each other with the same intensity with which we care for our patients.  It's just not always possible.  Communication is key, but the wheels of change are painfully slow some days and way too fast on others,"
good,wonderful team retention rates; our team is family; our patients are treated like family; managers care; outside of work get togethers; longer days but we have fun at work
good,Davita is a great growing company that offers room for growth. The offer tution help and guidance. Great benefits. Work closely together as a team. Great stepping stone for the health career.
good,"The benefits here are great! I enjoy my staff, as well as, my bosses. They are so easy to get along with and I really enjoy the people I get to see everyday! Raises are hard to come by though!"
good,I would have stayed if the starting hours of work were not so early in the morning. If i could have started about 7 when daycares were open i would have retired there.
good,"Working as and Intern Administrative Assistant at DaVita is highly rewarding due to the interactions between teammates and patients. On a typical day, I was working on filing paper work, drafting forms for patients, and helping answer and questions or concerns for patients. I find helping stratify a patients needs and being a strong support for the other teammates as a rewarding venture."
good,The best time at DaVita is when we celebrate the core values or homeroom meetings to give Kudos. Managers rolled up their sleeves and help when needed by weighing a patient or just walking around the clinic and speaking to the patients.
good,I was laid off. it was a good job.  I learned valuable life lessons.  Management changed and it affected morale.  The workplace culture changed.  The hardest part of communication with management.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"I love how every day the employees live by the core values and make Davita more than just a job, but a family. Davita RX gave me the ability have opportunities to grow within the company."
good,Teamwork has given us a one-stop solution that encompasses many of our project management needs. We've gone  a range of tools to just the one and work.
good,"DaVita had one of the best management training programs!"
good,"I was good while it lasted, haven't been there a full year and is now closing down selling out to Walgreens. Company was pretty good hardly any complaints, best job i ever had."
good,"I really enjoyed working here. Great teammates and awesome managers. I am very sorry the company is closing, but they were a great place yo work and make great friend."
good,"A typical day starts at 3 am setting up machines, testing the water system, before patients arrive to the center. The ratio is 4:1 with two Rn and Lpn. Everybody there works as a team even management. The hardest thing about the job is loosing your patients, because they become your family.DaVita has a great mission statement and I LOVE the patients whom we serve daily. Dialysis is a tough job, but it I very rewarding! Each day brings a new challenge but also each day bring a sense of pride knowing that a persons life was spared on more day because they were able to receive treatment.Depending on how big the facility is, the work environment can be fast paced"
good,"very satisfied, have worked there for over 7 years, very accustomed to the working conditions, everyone treated me like a family, clear assignments and desire to accommodate on the part of management."
good,"When I receive my certification,  i would love a chance to work with the staff again. The staff always got along and everyone was always willing to help each other."
good,"Wonderful Company that genuinly cared about the staff and patients."
good,"fast paced, organized, enthusiastic, fun, educational. I enjoyed caring for the Hemodialysis patient. Job requires good communication amongst health care team to ensure best out come for patient."
good,"I enjoyed all the duties assigned to me during my time with Davita. Hemodialysis was enjoyable. I liked educating patients on renal disease on dialysis. Work at times fast paced during shift changeover, but was doable. Good employees that worked as a team."
good,"I loved working at DaVita.  My coworkers were wonderful, as well as the patients.  I enjoyed my actual job duties, and the hours were ok.  I left because I was having medical issues.  I learned so much about kidneys, and healthcare in general.  A typical day included priming the machines, taking care of the water quality, hooking patients up and monitoring vitals, and keeping a good attitude.  There was lots of good teamwork involved."
good,"I enjoyed working for DaVita it more than a company its a family. Working with great people even on bad days make you feel grateful. I like that DaVita involves patients in games and awards patients for caring about them self as this is a life changing event in their lives,."
good,"I had to have back surgery in March of this year. Therefore I had to cut back on my full time commitment. I needed a simplier pace for recovery, due to fact that I am single and have to work, I could not take off the needed time for recovery, I was not even sure that my surgery was going to be successful, but by the grace of GOD I am healed and ready to get back to it."
good,"Davita is a very fast pace position, you have to be very efficient to get all the patients hooked up on time, but also be prepared if someone has complications. One of the best companies I've ever worked for, they gave me excellent training to make sure that I could do my job and do it well. The only reason I left is because my husband was switched to day shift from nights and we had no one to get our kids to school. I tried to stay PRN, but the way they schedule there was no need for me. I would recommend this company to anyone and everyone!"
good,"Long hours with very little relief for breaks due to the size of the clinic the RN could not leave for lunch, but also did not have to clock out for lunch. Patient's were like family, the staff were a team and worked together to make DaVita the best place to work. I really enjoyed my job. I am currently looking to use my BSN degree in a manager role."
good,"Everyone cares about each other and the work is meaningful.  The company culture is unlike any other company I have worked for... it is fun, balanced, and friendly."
good,This is a good international company that offers opportunities to relocate within the company. Great values with strict policy and procedures that are made clear to all.

good,"The clinic I work in is a very large clinic, the largest in Sacramento, so it is extremely fast past. The management team has communication issues, but usually admit it and work with you if a problem occurs. this company is awesome and they really love their staff."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,Great place to work. Patient care top priority. Advancement opportunities. Have been with the company many years. Great culture. We care for the community as well as each other.
good,A great place to work and have the proper balance for work and home.  Incorporates fun with work and great team work. Work load can be heavy at times. Loved the flex hours. Loved telecommuting!
good,Awesome place to work!! Other than not getting info once sick to cover job I have no complaints. Great Pay! Location & Traffic could be an issue but other than that no complaints.
good,I really enjoy working for Davita. I feel like they really care about me and my welfare. I have always enjoyed filling in at Cherry Hill and would like to work there full time. This job feels more like family than just a job. If I have an issue I feel like the higher up bosses care and listen to what I have to say. Davita is a great place to work and I have always felt appreciated.
good,"My day starts 6:30 in the morning on daily basis.Together with doctor, overview of the day is went over with relations to patients recent blood tests and lab results. The major difference in my workplace at this time compared to other jobs is exposure to patients with major life threatening medical conditions ( heart surgery patients, ICU/CCU, Step down heart centers, Neurosurgery). My management is very well understanding, and will help in time of overflow of incoming patients, and it made me feel that I was part of a team. Although my workplace is multicultural, we are all professionals and get along as a team to provide better and safe care for our patients. As a very flexible nurse, I have found the unpredictability of my schedule is very hard to plan my life around. At the end of the day, one on one interactions with my patients in such time of need makes me feel very useful and needed. Overall, my best quality is that i do not give up, reliable, and responsible. I'm well understanding of my orders in time of stressful situations, and able to remain professional under any conditions."
good,"I love working here and everyone I work with! Pay could be better for all the work I'm required to do. Moderate compensation overall. Hours can be long, but do-able. I couldn't ask for a better boss!"
good,"Wonderful place to work"
good,Excellent. It is a good opportunity to work with teammates and i could learn more about Dialysis and its treatment. There is continuous learning chances as classes conducted by experienced technicians.

good,"A typical day at work is to prepare for patients coming into the clinic for treatment.  I was previously a Facility Administrator but have recently stepped down to Clinical Coordinator.  Hardest part of the job was trying to work on the floor taking care of the patients while attempting to keep up with being the Facility Administrator of the clinic, while attending out of town meetings, deadlines, budgets.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interactions with the patients."
good,DaVita has a vibrant culture and the teammates that you work with are great. Career growth and opportunity are there to those who seek it and work hard; it also helps having a great leader. DaVita does really focus on patient care and their clinical outcomes show it.

good,"We work in a fast paced high stress environment, and we survive our days by working collectively to support one another. Laughter is the tool we use to combat the stress."
good,"I would travel all over the state of Iowa and assist dialysis patients with insurance questions. The biggest part of the job was retention of insurance with patients who has employer group health plans. I partnered with Social Workers to identify any potential loss, and help patients who were not insured, get insurance. The hardest part of the job was the traveling. The most enjoyable was the patients, I loved helping them."
good,"You get out of this company exactly what you put into it. If it is your desire to learn, grow and make a difference in the lives of others? Those goals can most definitely be achieved. I would not describe my job as hard but instead challenging because there are some many daily opportunities to step up your game and become a better you."
good,I worked at the Sun City Arizona location and could have not had a better experience. The staff at this particular facility was like family even from the very beginning. There is room for advancement and they promote from within.They also acknowledge and reward staff for a job well done and I believe that says something about the Da Vita culture. The facility administrator and one of the Patient Care Technicians in particular cared a great deal and it showed. Not to say the rest of the staff wasn't fantastic because they were!
good,"Approve New Hire clearance verifications"
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was Patient satisfaction. Davita promotes the work culture gearing towards patient satisfaction and interpersonal development.
good,"I love this company, the staff and patients. It can be very demanding for nurses. Assessment skills and ability to handle and document changing patient status while monitoring 10 or more patients at a time can be very stressful. Computer programs are old and difficult to navigate. Everyday you can leave knowing you did something important and rewarding."
good,I really loved working for Davita. The opportunities that Davita offers are by far the best I've seen. They really go out of the way to make the teammates feel confident  in any job role they pursue.
good,"Go to your assigned clinic and check if there is anything that is broken, if there is fix it and go to your other clinic do the same. After that, go hang out and enjoy your day!!!!!"

good,"I loved this job! The patients, co workers, leads, supervisors, events, schedules, and pay were all amazing and worth it! I really hate that they closed. I haven’t been able to find work that compares to Davita."
good,"Davita has been my employer for over 5 years. As I have grown with the company, I have watched it's philosophies and focus reorganize and change to putting more focus on employees, personal growth and development and community outreach. "
good,Excellent Company with great benefits and great growth potential for nurses. It’s a fast work environment but the work culture and inviting. I would recommend to any nurse Not familiar with dialysis because they have a great orientation process
good,"Challenging rewarding day to day operations. Very hands on job. Leading a team of clinical and non-clinical professionals to achieve the best clinical outcomes. Responsible for the overall management and supervision of a medical health care delivery facility. Providing leadership, supervision, inspiration and motivation of a highly skilled and diverse (social worker, dietitian, nursing, technical and biomedical) workforce. Monitor the facilities patients wellbeing and clinical outcomes."
good,Working with the people at DaVita was the best part of the job. It was a very collaborative environment and I would return to DaVita in a heartbeat if the opportunity arouse.

good,"DaVita is the first company I worked for that truly is a ""patient and employee first"" company. The have a a true understanding that without satisfied patients or employee's, they do it have a successful company. DaVita doesn't micromanage! As long as you're meeting deadlines and having enough productivity, they don't interfere or pick a part what you do throughout your work day.  They have a huge understanding and offer lots of programs to support work/life balance."
good,"Proud to be an employee where I’m appreciated and cared about. "
good,I really enjoyed working for this company but i needed a job that allowed me to pick up and drop off my kids to school. This is a great company to work for they are very open about how it works and very intent on keeping a health work life balance.
good,"Dialysis is a stressful field of nursing, as patients have multiple comorbid conditions.  The clinic setting is graded on how well the team manages the comorbid conditions in order to keep the patients out of the hospital, as hospitalizations are very costly to the ESRD program and Medicare.  This is a challenge as the program has moved from a fee for service to one of quality incentive and metrics based nursing.  A typical day of work as a clinical facility administrator in the San Antonio metropolitan area includes making rounds each shift to be the eyes of the surveyor and making sure the team is following policies and procedures outlined to maintain a culture of safety for teammates and patients.  The eyes of the surveyor also includes looking for any problems with the clinic that require general maintenance or creating a work order for outside vendors to complete.  Review of budgets, direct patient care ratios, financials,  patient lab values, adverse events, infection rates, utilization review of medications, teammate compliance of continuing education and licensing, CQI, core team meetings, and grievances (should there be any needing to be addressed).  The most enjoyable and challenging part of the job is knowing we are keeping patients alive through life-sustaining treatments.  Many of the patients are not eligible for transplant and we try to make sure the three days a week they spend in treatment with our clinic are the most pleasant and less stress free as possible.  Each exchange with the patient and family is an opportunity to teach and help them understand what"
good,overall the best company that I have worked for. Long hours early mornings. Rewarded for a job well done. I would recommend Davita to anyone who does not mind working hard and being compensated for a job well done.
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,My day at work was like learning every thing I need to know about the business . Treat the patient love and care and the manager direction and orders. the cu;ture at Davita was very pleasant and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was seeing the patiernts on the machine  because I could see how much pain they be in when lab tech was putting in the needle.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the patients and seeing a smile on the patients face.
good,"Dialysis usually is a busy job for technicians and nurses  due to tight  schedules between patients and kind of patients depends on your location. "
good,"The lab is a special place that takes patient care very seriously. The teammates are very special people who care about one another. The culture is FUN and it makes it a unique place. There are all kinds of celebrations and opportunity for growth. "
good,"A typical day at work you meet people from all walks of life always hear stories of their journey that placed them in dialysis, on a daily basis I learn the important functions of the kidney, the hardest part of the job isbuilding a bond with the patients and  watching them go thru their struggles and all that you do is not enough."
good,Has a vibrant work culture! A true village ....Great place to work that show great care for employees and patients. More for moving up in the company with in short timeframe.
good,"breaks"
good,"This was a place where patients came to received their Dialysis treatments so the environment had to be very clean and maintained. However, we as techs as well as nurses did make it a fun place for not just us but for the patients as well.There were some times of stress but we handled this the very best way we could.Hours were long and hard but rewarding as well."
good,"I have enjoyed my time with Davita. Strong sense of Culture. Like family. I was afforded many opportunities to advance and grow, however the opportunity to grow within my particular location are limited."
good,DaVita is a good company to work for. It is very fast paced your number one concern is always patient care. You have to understand RO water you have to understand the machine you will be working with you have to be able to  spot any and all problems that your patient's may be having and be able to control the situation at hand and ask for help when needed. You need to maintain verbal contact with your charge Nurse so the patients do receive the best care.
good,It's always busy and interesting! Never boring and Fun! The hardest part it's not crying because you do run into some policy holders not being able to afford their meds and this is very sad..
good,My experience was very good here.  Although management sometimes did not do things that corporate suggested. The overall experience taught me balance in my everyday life.
good,"After working for Davita for over 5 years, I finally took the chance and applied for a job outside of the clinic. I achieved a job offer without the help of any of my superiors. Dialysis Technicians are the hardest working people in any clinic and the absolute least paid. I do believe that dialysis techs should be compensated for their dedication and the incredible amount of stress they are put under. In my opinion, dialysis technicians that are paid $12.00 an hour and are responsible for patients' lives do not take their job seriously. I do think that the company needs to realize they will not attract loyal, dedicated workers unless they pay accordingly. These people are working themselves to death, pay them what they deserve."
good,Davita overall is a great company to work for. The company looks at individuals as teammates and not just employees. The culture is pretty laid back as fun is one of the core values. The pay isnt the greatest but it is a good place to start.
good,"Davita was where I completed my hours of externship for Everest college. I was only paid $10 an hour and I really loved the culture of the company. I continued to apply for one of the positions there but unfortunately, I didn't get the position so I moved on to something else. I just think it was a great company to work for."
good,"So many good things to say!  They have competitive wages, good training, lots of insurance options. Seasoned team mates. Good team work. Many locations, lots of different jobs available."
good,everyone was pleasant and easy to get along with and the patients were great i would recommend this job to anyone looking to care for people and continue education
good,Excellent company to work for with a great workplace culture. They provide excellent and ongoing training and education. They are a company that is very team oriented.
good,"Davita Clinical Research was my second family even though I have only been here a short time. I loved everything about it; the subjects, my teammates, the location, the research...  everything"
good,"It was fun working at Davita. we always go on training trips from one state to another. I never find it deficult working Davita. I make sure i go for any training that comes. my manager will work with you on your schedule, and they always buy us food."
good,night floor nurses have more admissions and days can be longer due to having a 4th shift.  DaVita team members tend to work together really well and have a good working relationship.  Overall a positive environment in my experience
good,"While I can honestly say I love my job, I am looking to relocate to the Augusta Georgia area.

I currently manage a facility in the Dialysis setting with over 200 patients and have 53 direct reports."

good,"I love working for Davita. I'm at part-time AA, due to my facility opening 3 days a week. Management is great and my team is like a family. I really enjoy the interaction with the patients and their families. The lack of hour is the only negative I have, other than that its a joy coming to work"
good,"The company has a lot of great benefits. Working closely with the patients makes it very rewarding. Management at the clinic I worked was outstanding. Typical day consists of a good morning to teammates and staffs, staying focus and positive about the days tasks and willingness to help.Work place culture well relaxed and friendly. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that you helped others to improve their quality of life. I learned how to be prepared to handle any situations and team work a must, staying focus,."
good,DaVita is a wonderful place to work.  The people are smart and dedicated to accomplishing their goals.  Teammates work hard but there is time for fun as well.
good,"Absolutely amazing company to work for. Your typical 8 hour day except when on call. The workplace culture was incredibly enjoyable and although the work could be demanding, in the end it was very rewarding."
good,Wake up and keep cellphone near by for any emergency calls. If no emergency calls just go about normal maintenance routine. Although having six facilities to one person makes it almost impossible to not have an emergency call each day.
good,"wonderful place to work! lovely coworkers and supervisors, very clean and controlled enviornment. long hours but the compensation and wonderful atmosphere make it more than worth it"
good,"I love this job so much, it is a family style environment and very good to learn nursing skills. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Not to mention the pay is good"

good,Very business sometimes stressful but I enjoyed it alot it was stressful or sometimes sad when a patient pass away. Sometimes it could be a long day.When someone call off
good,"Just the fact that you provide not only a treatment care to a person that is in need, is the care you have for the patients and as a company all the resources you provide to the community as far as services out side of what you do at work."
good,DaVita is a great company to work for.  They train and have pretty good benefits.  It is hard work but can be a lot of fun and very educational.  Being a Hemodialysis Patient Care Tech is a great job.

good,"Good place to work at,  family oriented,  fun good hrs,  supervisor is very understanding,  a place for growth.great team work with the staff"
good,"A typical day is 12-16 hours monitoring patients and treatment during  life-saving, ""kidney-cleansing"" treatments. Co-workers were great. Everyone worked together in having one another's back to ensure safe, efficient, treatments to those with kidney failure."
good,They call this place the village. It really does feel like you are working with your family members. Great staff and of the best companies i've ever worked for. The only reason I left was due to lack of pay and benefits. They showered us with gifts and provided a really fun creative environment. So much fun. I have a lot of good memories and made lifelong friends!

good,I enjoyed working with my teammates and making a difference with our patients our work place was always fun and very active depending on the day and how our patients were feeling. The hardest part of our job is the long hours and when our patients aren't feeling well and several at a time and we are trying to help our patients several at a time so we have to work in a fast manner.
good,"There is no typical day in healthcare, with that being said I have learned so much about kidney care and what it means for our patients and how important it is for them to have a support system.  The hardest part of the job is losing a patient.  There are so many moments that make me love the role, from putting a smile on a patients face to performance management.  My story has happened here at DaVita and the opportunities they have given those who work hard and are dedicated to the mission are endless."

I enjoyed visiting with the patients."
good,DaVita is a wonderful company to work for.  I have worked here for over 7 years and have nothing negative to say.  I have recently earned a degree that may take me away from the company for a while but hopefully in time they would create a position that will incorporate my skills and I will be able to return.

Unfortunately, my life circumstances did not allow me to continue employment with them.  However, I definitely recommend this company to all."
good,"I learned that in a facility like Davita you have to work  as a teammate, not just in sequence with one another but together. Things unexplainable happen, it can get overwhelming at times when patients come in and need to be place at a machine as 4 other people. I learned you have to have overall patience, you have to show care and concern, and you have to be mindful of others."
good,"My coworkers are awesome, we work excellent as a team. I would say the hardest part of the job are the very long days and being constantly on your feet, but in the end, the job is rewarding."

I enjoyed my time at Davita the most as I got along extremely well with everyone and my supervisor was great,she was a great listener and great mentor.I learned alot from her during my time there and felt welcomed from the very first day I started! I was able to get my certification through my job which was excellent!"

good,"Responsible for taking vital signs, monitor patients on hemo-dialysis machines, also phlebotomy, and calculation of the patients weights. canulation of grafts, glucose monitoring, and reuse processing. The management was fair and tried to make sure we got training. Co-workers were like family.

good,The management is fair and help you become part of a team with great teamwork.
good,"My clinic is perfect! Okay, so I know that nothing is perfect, but the clinic that I work for is as close at you can get. We have a great group of girls that work extremely hard every day. I previously worked at a non-Davita dialysis clinic for 4 years, and it could not even compare! My FA now is amazing, and she actually cares about her employees & wants to see us advance. The RN's at this clinic work just as hard as everybody else (which you do not see very often). This company is awesome to reimburse me (be it that I make good grades), and to work around my schedule so I can go back to school. At work I have a pretty set routine. I put patient's on the dialysis machine, take them off, I work in reuse, I do labs, I make bicarb & acid, etc.. The most rewarding part of my job is getting to interact with my patients' and hopefully make a positive difference in their day. The hardest part of my job is change-over! Some days it goes smoothly, & other days I am like a chicken with my head cut off. I have been a dialysis tech for a little over 5 years now, & I can attest that not all clinics are the same, but mine is great!"
good,"A typical day at DaVita is a long one, starting as early as 415 in the morning and ending as late as 9 at night or later. You spend it in various parts of the facility, taking care of patients mostly."

But I always kept in mind that I am helping them down the path of healthiness. Management was great. She always made things enjoyable. We had a fun day once a month. (crazy sock day, crazy hair day, guess whos the one in the baby pictures, ect.) The patients seemed to love watching us walk around like that. I always put a smile on their face.

good,"I really loved the job overall at Davita, but I wasnt able to interact with customers. A typical day would start off by printing out all my reports and going thru my work bucket. Figuring out which ones needs to be tended to first. If a patient was going to another state and needed the insurance to be loaded properly for transfer, this needed to be done right away.I learned alot about Medicare and different type of medical software systems at Davita. And about kidney dialysis. The hardest part of this job was keeping everything in order. I am a really organized person, and i hate to say this, but the work load was alot. Your in charge of hundreds of patients with alot of facilities. It does become overwhelming at times, but not impossible to get thru. I loved that they were always sending you to some kind of training. either a system update to sending you to a facility to see what dialysis is all about.  My co workers were great. I worked along side my mom here and loved it. Davita just wasn't the right job for me, I like to be involved more than just sitting behind a desk in a tall office building, but i sure did learn alot for this job."

Hardest part about the job is when you make a bond with a patient and the are no longer in facility.

DaVita provided some great bright colored uniforms... color is everything. I learned how companies should put fun back into the work place. I had a good bunch of co-workers who would jump in and lend a hand. The hardest part of the job was when we would lose a patient. The most enjoyable part was when one of the patients would get the call for a TRANSPLANT!

No question was ever left unanswered or problem unresolved. My teammates were awesome as well as those that were apart of the float pool.
