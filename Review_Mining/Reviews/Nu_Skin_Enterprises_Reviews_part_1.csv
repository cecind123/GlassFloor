rating,review
bad,The culture has changed drastically and no long motivates employees in a positive way. Loyalty is not rewarded. It is difficult to be promoted and really aren't any career paths even though this is something they say exists.
bad,I was an independent distributor so I was investing in the company. I was opening a new area in Argentina and helped many distributor to communicate with local business. I enjoy the interpreter role of the whole deal.
good,"Very fun workplace, you get to speak with many customers, helped with my customer service skills. Really nice coworkers, and the management are really nice."
good,"Nu Skin's family first culture was one that would make any employee excited to come to work. in the last 12 months, the Technology org is in the middle of a major leadership and culture transformation and it's wearing everyone out. Talent is leaving and is not being replaced fast enough. Nu Skin's sales are not growing so it's uncertain that missing headcount will ever be filled, which means the extra work is probably here to stay."
good,"Well you get calls from distributors of the project, answer questions, fix issues and keep the customer happy. I liked the people I worked with but it was easy to feel like a face in the crowd there. I didn't feel like my suggestions for making the business better were taken seriously. Overall, it was a good college job that I would not go back to."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be handling the Translations inbox as this is my main responsibility. As soon as all requests are sent out for the day, I follow up on the ones that are due prior to today. Meticulous follow up is required for this job."
good,The LA team doesnt have a lot of resources to help distributors in South America. It was frustrating for them and us to try to figure out how to help them.
good,Good place to work . There is not chance to grow because positions are taken right away for people that have been working there longer. Bonuses are pretty good
good,"The best part about the position is you run your own schedule.  If you don't have a large network to tap into, it's challenging to get started.  They offer strong training and information sessions but high out of pocket expenses to start up business."
good,Empresa muy joven con graves problemas de management. muy pocas posibilidades de crecimiento en ciertos puestos
good,Nu Skin was great for pay as well as flexibility of job and all of the people that worked there are all friendly and helpful.   I would work there again if he opportunity arises.
good,The company does a good job caring for their employees as well as the community.  They have a wonderful force for good program that provides opportunities to help others in need.  The work environment is fun.
good,"Nu Skin is a great company to work with.  It's a strong company, especially internationally.  It's a very solid company with great benefits and a positive environment."
good,Most of the people are good and honest. It is a fun company to work for with good growth and development. There are a few key managers that are VERY difficult to work for and very dishonest.
good,The Operations department is given much more freedom to do what we want. We are not as micromanaged as the Sales Department. Management could learn to promote people who actually deserve the promotion rather than promoting friends
good,It was a descent place to work and they trained on forklifts. Reach lifts Order picker lifts and Turret lifts. Manager was great as well as team leader and supervisor
good,"Probably the most relaxed company I've worked at, with great work/life balance, and they treat employees quite well. "
good,"My job was explaining the compensation plan and various limited time bonuses to distributors when they would call in explaining all of the ins and outs of the sales model. Biggest pro to this job is that you get connected to every other department in the business. You work with marketing to help promote promotions, you work with product support to make sure license agreements for the bio-metric scanner are correct. You work with account managers to help build teams and identity the consequences of breakaways. Hours are mostly fixed with a few extra hours offered at the end of the month to help distributors meet their goals."
good,"It's a great part time job as long as they train you how to do your job the right way, some don't train you, and others don't even try to train you the right way."
good,Nu Skin has been a wonderful place to work. The culture here is great and it's largely due to an amazing executive team.  Nu Skin is a wonderful place to work and your lucky if you get to work there.
good,I worked in Nu Skin's call center with their distributors. It was a fairly straight-forward position and I enjoyed it while working through my bachelor's degree.
good,"I appreciate that management treat us with respect.  There is no micro-managing."
good,"At Nu Skin, we worked together to give out information and results of our products to our clients through the use of social media platforms. Nu Skin has definitely helped me to learn how to promote goods in intricate detail, and management and coworkers there are very kind and always willing to lend a hand. They, as would any workplace, want their employees to work hard and have the drive and passion for the sale of the merch given to the clients. I truly enjoyed seeing all the kinds of products we had. 4 stars."
good,"Nu Skin is a great place to work and is a large enough company that it provides opportunities in a variety of career paths. The culture is upbeat and fun, but there is a lot of change happening that might impact the feeling that came from the founders of the company."
good,"I loved working at Nu Skin and really enjoyed having access to free products, like skin and hair care, makeup, nutritional supplements, etc. However, even though I explained my disability to them, I was still fired for not being able to measure up with the other employees."
good,Most of the management was good and the pay was better than most other college-type jobs.  Lack of career advancement potential was my reason for leaving.
good,"Good company culture      "
good,"A pretty easy job that isn't terribly strict, though, its the kind of place where one person messing up can screw over hundreds of other people. pay is okay, not great, and the breaks are regular as well as the people are nice."
good,great place to work. however the original culture is changing.  executive management is in flux. Job security is not what it used to be.  Nice perks for the employees.
good,"I really enjoy my time here at Nu Skin. Your coworkers and managers become your greatest friends. The benefits here are great, you get free product, and paid time off is earned and available. The pay is good and I will be sad to leave here. It is a call center so of course you will get some angry customers or people that expect exceptions from you all the time, but you will get that anywhere. All the other great things about Nu Skin outweigh the not so fun parts of working. Nu Skin is also run by great people who really care about their employees and are really understanding."
good,"Nu Skin really does go above and beyond in the company culture department. No holiday or hard work goes unnoticed. Never will you see an employee not be rewarded in someway for their hard work. Nu Skin has a an awesome, playful, energetic, yet professional and productive work environment. Once of the best I have ever seen!"
good,"I was an intern at Nu Skin for about four months, so my experience is limited. It was a great place to jump start my career with great mentors as support."
good,The part i worked for was closed down. no offer of moving me to a new job. after that i got on at Ancestry then laid off from that. After that time life has been hard.
good,"Nu Skin is a great company. The advisor would courage you to apply for a better position in the company instead of staying in the call center. The advisors and Co-workers are nice, they always help each other to success this work. Nu Skin also provides free simples for employees to use."
good,"It is a perfect job if you live in Provo/ Orem, Utah. Company tries really hard to take good care of each employee by giving frequent bonus and promotions, etc."
good,"A typical day starts when I clock in, log in on phones and computers, set up everything and get ready to take phone calls. I have become more open and comfortable to talking to people on the phone. I have become better at dealing with problems from customers. I have also learned the same thing from co-workers. I have been more open by talking to them and asking for help or giving help. Getting to meet my co-workers and the comfortable environment also happens to be one of my favorite parts of the job. The management is always understandable yet strict and makes sure we progress in our job. The hardest part is probably dealing with the difficult cases on the phones and making sure we are helping them to the best of our ability."
good,"A fin de impulsar los equipos comerciales, se dise√±aban estrategias de aprendizajes, marketing y conocimientos de la plataforma de negocios. "
good,I greatly enjoyed my time at Nu Skin.  The people and policies they had were spot on and I never hated going to work.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.
good,"A typical day of work included setting up customer accounts, teaching customers about products, selling products, and general store maintenance. I learned about a wide variety of products and the general workings of an MLM company."
good,"A wonderful place to work with positive-minded colleagues who are supportive, helpful and open to helping one another succeed."
good,Nu Skin management strive to give their eimployees all of the opportunities they can to improve and learn. The culture is mostly relaxed and pleasant.
good,"* Call Business Partners"
good,"I would schedule three to five product demonstrations daily and then I would also go and prospect the new potential distributors.  "
good,"Typical Day: Answer phones calls and help with order making and shipping issues"
good,"Excellent employer, great working environment, great employee support, excellent family/work balance, super motivational. Would recommend anyone to work there."
good,"I worked at NuSkin for 2 years, approximately 10 years ago.  Still it is the best job I have ever had.  I have never seen a company live up to what it preaches in regards to taking care of their employees, as well as NuSkin does.  They live up to the culture they preach."
good,"Nu Skin is a fantastic company, with lots of opportunities for language speakers as well as English. Their pay is good, their management is friendly, and their benefits and bonuses are generous. I don't think I have ever worked for as great of a company that has treated me as amazingly as Nu Skin has. If you are in Provo as a student and want to work somewhere better than just on campus, work for Nu Skin. I can't give them enough praise."
good,"Nu Skin is a great place to work. They know what they are doing, promote from within, train people, grow globally and are highly, highly ethical."
good,"I love the concept of the company, its dynamic, products and the people working here.  It feels more like a family & community than a job.   It is a very proactive, flexible and welcoming company."
good,"If you are a very outgoing person then this is the job for you. You have the ability to make as much or as little as you want, but with hard work. On weeks i didn't work, I still made money"
good,"Great place to work, you get free product, and a lot of great bonuses and benefits. Easy work and very fun! My mangers were all very good and I made a lot of great friends"
good,"great opportunities and great people to work with."
good,I really like the company and the work place it helps you become a better person and also it helps you if you want a career there as well. Great people to be around
good,Part time sale of health and beauty products from home. Wonderful company with room for growth if you are motivated. Ability to make as much or as little money as you like.
good,"Me resulta alentador poder contar con un proyecto personal que pueda complementarlo con un trabajo fijo, ya que lo que hoy busco es generar la mayor cantidad de ingresos."
good,Love working for this company. They are honest and cutting edge. The products have added value to my life and many others.
good,"Nu Skin Enterprises is a fantastic place to work. Everyone is likable and friendly. My job in Facilities was flexible, which was key while in school. I love Nu Skin."
good,I  enjoy working for nu skin but I wish it was a full time job. I have great co-worker and
