rating,review
bad,Aucun respect pour les employés de la part de la direction.
bad,"Management is not far, there is lots of favoritism, HR is terrible not there for the people, they go against each other, point fingers and you work more hours then your at home."
bad,"Rude management "
bad,"Pesimo servicio, jefes mal educados no se diga la de RH"
bad,It was blistering hot in the summer and freezing cold in the winter. We worked like slaves. They were very unfair. We needed things to be fixed and the would bandaid it and tell us to keep running. They always talked about quality Parts. But how can you make Quality Parts if the machines are working with or not coming out to spec and our team needs still pass it. And when it gets sent back us as the welders get in trouble
bad,Would not work there anymore manager are rude and treat the employee's  unfair Tenneco is garbage. I tell friends don't work there they don't show you how to run the different types of machinery in order to work in a safe and proper manner they just throw your on the machine and you have to learn on your own which is not good so in my opinion Tenneco is not a great place to work at.
bad,"Big turn over, would not recommend. For it being a union shop no Stewart's on floor. You hav'ta call union hall make appt to see your Stewart.  Much better places to wrk."
bad,I do not recommend working here unless you are absolutely desperate for a job. They start you off with 8$ an hour while working mostly 12 hour days. They will also forget to give you break for hours on end. The plant is closing down soon anyway.
bad,This is feast or famine.  Get rid of good workers and keep the worst ones.  Head of HR is a joke.  They do not go by a burden of proof.  Ligonier campus is a joke. They keep Supervisors who sleep with their operators.  They do not follow their own hand book except when they are trying to get rid of you.
bad,"The only reason I am still an employee here is for a paycheck. HR and upper management are unethical & lack integrity. Favoritism should be their motto. Training is obsolete, accountability is more like the blame game, and trying to advance will get you a ticket to the unemployment line. Hard-working employees are usually let go or fired while bad behavior, for the most part, is rewarded with a promotion. Going to HR on issues or concerns will cost you your job. Being honest and ethical will also cost you your job. I implore anyone looking for job security, growth, or professionalism DO NOT work here."
bad,"Tenneco is ran like a bad joke. Six months ago they promoted a bunch of inexperienced kids 18-25 years old to be team leaders which drove the indirect labor cost through the roof. They cause drama due to the lake of actual work that needs to be done but they feel there above hands on work, the supervisors are lazy and friends with the team leaders so they don’t make them do anything. Supervisors rather spend time harassing  the seniority employees while there team leaders hang out with there arms crossed or hands in there pockets all day sitting in the offices With there feet up on the desks, eating, and talking. The management including HR know this is what’s going on. Discrimination at its worst. I am embarrassed to say I worked there."
bad,The money was good everything else was not. A lot of internal problems. I never seen a place with so much lack of support. Department against department shift against shift. Management doesn't listen to employees and their request for help concerning production matters and then when things go bad management blames the employee this place is a hot mess. And I would not expect any kind of help from human resources. If you decide to work here good luck to you!
bad,"I do not know anything about the floor. When I was there, the improvements to 5s and safety was driving the culture on the floor. HR was a nightmare. A lot of overtime"
bad,I worked there 5.5 years and pointed out. They're attendance policy is 6.5 points max and is termination...You are always replaceable and you will not grow in the company unless your a brown noser.
bad,"Management says they care but they don't typical rich people always acting like their business is struggling that's why they make 9.6billion a year ,most of the machines are half working or not everything thier is jerry rigged its a joke,the problem is not the employees it's the management."
bad,"The managers do not care if you live or die. Outdated equipment and if you get hurt, they'll do everything to nmake it look like it's your fault and fire you"
bad,Hard to deal with this work environment because of the fact that they make you a mandatory 12 hours a day with no days off to relax and give you a break.
bad,Very poor company if you don't fit in with the click they walk you out the door immediately. Very poor management. Have said the cell i was working in was for stupid people. Drama everyone talks about everyone
bad,if you have children and don't want to be able to be involved with sports and activities this is the job for you .you have to be in upper management to get weekends off so you know they don't care if hourly worker's get time off because it doesn't affect them I'm not exaggeratin it's awful they really treat people terrible that's why they have a huge turnover work force
bad,"Alright place to work but they don’t care about their workers or paying them what they deserve for the job they do, my wife was also a welder and because she is female they refused her welder premium which was anextra $1.50/hr."
bad,Empresa excelente mas as oportunidades para o meu perfil são poucas.
bad,"it is very fast paced with little to no communication from management, supervisor's or lead people. everybody tries to pass the buck when something goes wrong instead of owning up to their mistakes and that includes management."
bad,No life/work balance at all.  No support from senior management.  Worked for company for almost 3 years and had only seen my supervisor 3 times.  Nothing spectacular about this job or company.
bad,Absolutely God Awful!  There are not enough bad words to describe this He** Hole.  Who ever heard of a company actually trying to fire employees?  After a year of abuse I walked out after lunch.  People are humans not slaves.  Period.
bad,"this company does not deserve a rating !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,very poor management. no one ever knows whats going on. way to many layoffs and when your not getting a layoff your working a lot of over time. they care very little to none about you. and to advance there is also very hard unless your a man because of the new team leader positions that you have to do set up as well.
bad,"Awful place to work. Obsolete equipment and facility, dirty and dark. When it rained you could see it because of the excess leaking in the roof system. Very ""good old boy"""
bad,"unsafe, stressful, disrespectful, back stabbing, deadbeats, boss's pet(s), good ole boy culture, rules from one to the other are inconsistent, rednecks, managers insecure"
bad,"High Turnover on every level, daily reporting on key financial metrics, very little respect for work/home balance. Most of the new employees are from a competitor."
bad,Do not care for the employees at all. very sneaky and keeps secrets about the company financials.I cant wait to find another job that has a future in the community.
bad,Very hectic and unorganized place to work. Management is terrible. Lunches and breaks are not much. Point system. Hated working for Tenneco. Worst job I have ever had.
bad,Management was terrible. People that work for this company were always upset. Terrible work environment. The union doesnt help the people that are paying them to do there job. Not a place I would ever recommend to anyone.
bad,I would do my best to do the job I was given. I did what I could when the machine wasn't broken down.  The supervisor was hard to please.
bad,"working with this company was very rewarding and safe invironment"
bad,Get treated like a child while working 7 days a week. Watch management get bonuses for your hard work while they give you a t- shirt. That is also your Christmas bonus......a t-shirt.
bad,i only worked here for a day. it was not a friendly environment and the pay was not good enough and i didnt like making pizzas.
bad,hope that you enjoy working with foreigners. and make next to nothing. not a union shop people always telling on each other and
bad,"You dont have a life here, the management sucks they are clueless. They have no clue whats going on. Theres better places to work besides here. Tenneco dont care if you have a family or not the plant comes first . 7 days a week 12 hour shifts thats no life at all. All the employees are after each others throats they try to fire one another for no reason at all. Avoid this place to work aint nothing but drama . One year it snowed 2 feet and they expected all there employees to be there even the ones that lived in west Virginia and they gave points to ones that didnt come in when it was a state of emergency.  Trust me this place is a nightmare stay far away from here."
bad,A noisy place and no leadership. if OSHA visit the place I think it would be shut down. I think any place would be good to work if you had the right leadership to run the place.
bad,"Automotive Manufacturing, high speed assembly lines, must be able to multitask.  Hardworking dedicated hourly workforce."
bad,Nahezu permanenter Überstunden-Einsatz (Wochenende) in gewissen Produktionsbereichen
bad,"salário incompatível com o emprego, sem salubridade por ser um ambiente de periculosidade e com nível altíssimo de LER."
bad,Your just a number to them and they will work ya to death because they don't care!
bad,Worst place I have worked and I have worked with several Fortune 300 companies. Upper Management was so inept. The direction was zero and the support was less than zero.
bad,"Absolute shambles of a company. Started off great, but goes down hill really fast when your threatened with your job on a weekly basis, by management staff who are completely incompetent and seem to have no real clue as to what they are doing. They have a quantity not quality mindset which is why they've lost most of their JLR contracts and ended making everyone redundant."
bad,bad management and hostile work environment. Typical day is very stressful. Workplace culture is bad. Rapid and continuous management changes..........
bad,Management doesn't care about quality or safety only wants to line their pockets and cut hourly workers heads every chance they get. Management doesn't believe in keeping equipment to standard duct tape and zip ties are there go to they do not allow pm work to be done to correctly fix equipment nor do they get parts needed
bad,"If you like working 12 hour days 7 days a week this is the place for you. Otherwise, just stay away. They have no value in family live. There are some who have worked 7-8 months with no time off. They expect you to live there. Supervisors are some of the worst I have ever worked for, some of them you wonder how they are even supervisors."
bad,this place did not care about me and my leaving....they were happy to see me go as they knew i knew what was going on inside the walls not only of this tenneco but others as well. the last year i worked ther i had a target on my back. i told on the managers that were doing wrong and it ruined my life and ability to find new housing and employment. tenneco is a very bad part of america
bad,"Worked over 90 hours a week for 18 months. Caused me to have a stroke and then they fired me. Because I couldn't work 90 hours anymore. New Operations Manager was bringing his own people in, from our competitors and forcing all the old Group Leaders out. Found every way possible to do it."
bad,"Bad!bad!bad!, Would recommend this place to anyone ever,absoultley horrible place to work, every day was another bad experience, do yourself a favor and stay away from there!!!"
bad,"They treat you like a number..Point Blank Period You will work 84 hours a week for a month in a half straight,If you speak up or show that you are not their to meet friends they will find away to get you fired."
bad,"Long hours with no work/life balance.  Pay may be good, but it's not worth the environment.  Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Management is sub par with no direction or team attitude."
bad,"Upper management clueless, horrible working conditions, forced excessive overtime. Worst company i ever worked for. Zero work life balance, turnover rate is pheinominal."
bad,This place has management turnover like crazy...  three plant managers in less than a year. Multiple value stream managers in the same time frame. Engineers and trades leaving just as quick. The standards are nonexistent.  It's amazing they can keep their ISO certifications. Some of the higher level management will tell you all is great and then throw you under the bus big-time. The people on the floor are great and very helpful ... many see the same issues.
bad,"Throughout my employment with Tenneco I encountered several discrimination and harassing situations from upper management as well as fellow employees. I reported everything that I endured to HR, Supervisors, team leaders etc with no results punishment nor disciplinary actions sanctioned to those people. I was also told when and how to use my FMLA which I thought was against the law. Never work there if you don't have to!!! Period!!#"
bad,This plant is closed down.  It was a major health risk just walking in the door. Very dirty and oil everywhere.  people were consistently getting hurt from slipping on the oil film that was on the floor.  people getting cancer from working in the chrome plater.   very unclean air. just a horrible place to work
bad,If you don’t fit in with the mgmt clicks you won’t last. I see them come and go.  One value stream manager will cuss you and upper mgmt seems to do nothing because it still happens and he thinks he runs the place. Rules apply to only some. You report an issue and it’s according to who it’s on whither it gets addressed.  Some of my coworkers get emergency vacation for a reason and others don’t get it approved.  HR needs to be looked in to for unfair treatment. Supervisors will let some off but won’t let others off for the same reasons
bad,"Gostava muito de trabalhar na manutenção elétrica da tenneco...isto ate que houve troca da supervisão..."
bad,If they tell you we have a culture of ethical compliance they are lying. Two plant managers now in Lansing and they get worse... goal is to work you to death and find another soul to torment. Even the HR department is sketchy.
bad,Company itself isnt bad.  The work and hours are what ruin it.  12 hour night shifts on 2-3 day rotations is hard on the body especially with family.  Doesnt pay enough for the stress either.  Welding for time and quota is ridiculous.  Some very unrealistic standards.  Overall its really not worth it.
bad,good pay with good benefits. but hopefully you don't mind being brow beated and talk to like you are stupid. used to love my job but over the last 3 yrs it has gotten to be a very negative work environment.
bad,Management does a lot of people wrong. I have learned a lot since I have been there but its not taking me anywhere at tenneco. At least I can take it with me.
bad,Work 7 days a week 10 to 12 hour days.  High turnover due to bad management and unsafe working conditions.  Had 5 new plant managers in 2.5 years very unstable culture.  Materials department could never get parts to the line or order correctly from vendors.  Even if you make rate the upper management would drop the ball and run out of materials so overtime is always available.
bad,Worked mandatory 72-84 hour work weeks every week. Very disorganized and messy. We were required to perform tasks that most likely weren't always legal.
bad,money is good some of the people are good but they work too much very stressful environment supervisors treat employees like trash its like working on egg shells
bad,Tenneco is a good position for those who are willing to deal wit unfair management...and not being paid on time. other then that they have hard worker as teammates. and they make the job worth wile.
bad,"very faced paced, difficult hours and working conditions. The work is very hard and demanding. The environment is very hot in the summer and cold in the winter. expectations are very high for low pay."
bad,"Management was abysmal not listening to any views of experienced workers with very much of a do as I say culture."
bad,"30+ years on the floor."
bad,Tenneco is a good company to make money at no promotions for welders always promote the least worthy people and management totally sucks. I would never go back. It has ac hookups but they removed the ac and just turn on the fans to act like it works. Worst part is 1 10 min break and a 20 min lunch. Thats all.
bad,"The job itself is dirty and oily in the rods manufacturing department. The management was terrible, they dont care about you. I once worked two months with NO days off."
bad,"poor place to work "
bad,They do not respect hard work and attendance. The material managers make changes to the job weekly without knowledge of the job or asking for input making an impossible job even more impossible. They will lie to you about everything just to try to keep you motivated and coming back. You will not get a job you bid on based on experience or qualifications it’s solely based on friendships. No matter what they say if your not in the friends circle you will not grow with this company.The pay is good and that is all that I can say good about it. They do not treat people equally what so ever.
bad,"long hours"
bad,"When I first came to this plant, it was loosing $13 million per year. To say that the plant and equipment were antiquated would be a gross understatement. The workforce had been on 12 hour schedules for 7 days per week for almost 3 years. Trust in leadership was non existent. Trying to motivate the work force and gain trust was a challenge. We made a significant financial turn around in my tenure at Tenneco Hartwell, but not enough to reinvest in the plant and workforce as I would have liked. There are some good people at this plant."
bad,It wasn’t a bad place to work before a different set of upper management came to play. Micro management is their thing and you better have your ducks in a row when they start asking you questions of why this or that happened.
bad,After working with this company for years I have realized that once they put a target on your back they go after you and if you are doing nothing wrong they will make things up and harass you non stop. Employees on the floor are hard working people that would like just a little appreciation instead they get nothing if you try to take two steps forward they will put you Five steps back. Would NOT recommend to my worst enemy...
bad,Run away far away this company is the worst I have ever worked for they don't have a clue on how to run a business. Management is unfair working long hours just to get the quota the can care less about quality. I work in rod dept and supervisor is clueless on how to be nice always asking you to work  overtime its never about family. Don't get me wrong there is money to be made but you have to live here 12 hours .a day 7 days a week. God help you if you sick or someone in your family is sick you get wrote up if you take day off. I would not recommended this place to any one that want a life in currently looking for another job. No family life here. People here are upset and grumpy cause of work hours. Also they hire and fire people like crazy if you don't follow them .
bad,"Poorly managed company, run remotely out of USA. As a medium level employee, I was caught not having enough insight into management view of manufacturing floor performance. Too many people CYA mentality, and the lies that come with that."
bad,Terrible management if you’re not in the “it” crew they don’t do anything for you. You can’t get your vacation days approved forced to work 7 12s while the “it” works Mon-Fri they don’t care about you your skills or your personal life
bad,"Closing up operations due to inefficiencies and lack of good management. No leadership, poor communication, extremely poor follow up, Very authoritarian, and no respect for employees."
bad,Co workers always trying to get each other in trouble to look good for management who doesn’t doesn’t care about anything but handing out points like they’re candy. Would not recommend working here the money is not worth the stress this place brings
bad,No heating no gloves different rules for different people desperate place shocking place to work nobody knows anything if u ask a question no procedures just guessing really bad morale is very low flt trucks are terrible never serviced
bad,"Valoración positiva en cuanto a la forma de trabajar, trabajo exigente, sueldo decente, mala gestión del trabajador de ett, precariedad absoluta, disponibilidad absoluta, exigencia total de implicación con la producción/calidad/empresa y poco o ningún reconocimiento para los trabajadores de ett."
bad,"Polityka firmy jak i zarządzanie są w całości skandaliczne, mobing jest na gigantycznym poziomie. To taka moja prywatna subiektywna opinia."
bad,"VERY Poor management. Made work very stressful, no bonuses, minimal raises."
bad,Tenneco as a whole is a very stressful and unrewarding place to work. Their time studies are done unfairly making production quotas nearly impossible to make. No lunch and only 2 breaks in an 8 hour period is sometimes grueling.
bad,Come in and do your job. Dont learn anything new unless going to a new job.Management is poor. Job was not hard at all. Meeting new people and friends.
bad,They don't care about there employees always wants to give a LOW slip and count things against you that are not your fault. I make the best of this place but it's not well put together.
bad,very dangerous place to work. No support from management and no safety practices or guidelines. No advancement possible or predictable. A extremely dangerous atmosphere to work in.
bad,Tenneco would be a good place to work but a lot that goes on is racially motivated and you don't want to end up on the wrong side of things or you won't have a job.
bad,Wouldn't recommend a job at Tenneco to anyone. Poor management and unsafe environment when it rains the roof leaks every where. there's a lot of favoritism that goes on in the company
bad,The management team does not have a vision or strategy to get where the would like to go.  Vision and Values are rarely referenced or followed.  It is ran like a country club with a lot of politics and closed door meetings.  If you are in the good ole boys club you are golden.
bad,"The job overall would be better if we worked as a team and not as individual people. Management is rare and far in between. I try to lean about things from others, but I usually have to learn by myself."
bad,"To much favortism, plays gmes. Fired everyone on 3rd shift. required to work 12 hour shifts 7 days a week. Stay out of this place. No parts to fix equipment, no training."
bad,"This place has reverse rotation of shifts nights days afternoons, fantastic benefits but terrible management and even worse work life balance. Its hours are designed to mentally and emotionally break you down to the point you are easily controlled. Great no mind work if you can tolerate the constant abuse by management and co-workers who are dating or related to management."
bad,"Was let go after a year, had another job but they counter offered.  Dumb mistake on my part, the reorganized me out of a job.  Poor Management high turnover."
bad,"Management here is beyond anything I have ever seen. Absolutely terrible in every aspect. Was great when I started there, went down hill when they started hiring people for management from one of their competitors. You would’ve thought they were coming in to run the company into the ground. Treat people very poorly, operations manager is the absolute worst. Sad this company ended up the way it is."
bad,"Little or no opportunity for training, development, or advancement.    Leadership either provided no direction or changes direction / micromanages strategic objectives."
bad,Alway watch your back because u will get stap in the back manger don't try to work with u no leadership I say everyone deserves a fair chance if they put a true foot forward
bad,Only join if you like being single or getting divorced since you will never see your family. The company leadership changes frequently and nothing is done consistently except to run from one side of the boat to the other. The workforce is loyal and hardworking. They deserve better than what they are currently getting.
bad,"weil ich in der Probezeit 3 Tage erkrankt war,wurde mir jetzt nach 8 Wochen,trotz immer maximalem Arbeitseinsatz zum 15.11.17 gekündigt,mehr sage ich nicht zum Management,bzw.Betriebsrat"
bad,"You never know when you have to work or when you will get off of work. They are not organized on the hours. Didn't like that you worked holidays, and i would have to work over and then they would send 2nd shift home."
bad,I went to my machine and started to work till the first break then i took five steps and ate a chip. It was a short break so i worked till the next break came along and i ate another chip and had a drink that time. Then i went back to my slave grind and got a headache and all dirty. Then i felt relieved when it was time to go home. I learned absolutely nothing.I worked alone. The hardest part of the job was being isolated and going insane. Going home i would say was the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,"Manage all aspects of facilities, equipment and tool and technicians in the manufacturing of exhaust systems.  I enjoy working with all levels of internal and external customers.  "
bad,this job sucks they over work you and treat you horribly they work you every day and expect you to perform as if you have not been pushing your body to the max i hated this job only stayed to finish paying college
bad,"Я попала на роботу сюди через агентство, зарплата мала, а період робочого часу вижимає всі соки з українців. Після перших днів думаєш як наступного дня робити, оскільки руки відпадають. Робота розрахована прибуток компанії, це дуже важко відновити сили після робочого дня, це нереально. Не їдьте сюди на роботу, я не рекомендую сюди їхати."
bad,Do not like what I see. It only seems to be getting worse. They are not hiring the right kind of people and they are becoming top heavy in the management area.
bad,Most of the workers had respiratory issues (I had blood coming out of my ears). Complaints were ignored. Now I find they let hexavalent chromium (the deadly one) all over the plant and did nothing about it. People have died from cancer and I have respiratory issues I have never had. HORRIBLE place to work.
bad,They pay well and have some good benefits but your opinion will be completely ignored. I would not recommend this company.
bad,"I had bad experience with Tenneco."
bad,I had to work constantly i hardly ever got a day off and we worked 10 hours on Monday through Saturday then 8 hours on Sunday for months at a time and some times we didn't have any part so we get sent home early.
bad,"This company currently is in turmoil.  The management team in place along with the Board of Directors are truly questionable.  The core of any business is integrity and I can truly say from experience the legacy management team needs to look deep down and ask themselves ""are we doing what is best for the employees and shareholders""?  At this time, that would be NO!"
bad,"The hardest part of the job was after saving the company millions of dollars, working with countless third parties and global partners I was let go because the company was unable to SPIN."
bad,"First off you don't know day to day if you have a job. They are moving machines around and forcing one Pearson to do a two Pearson job. Then your told if your numbers are not good enough they will just fire you. The third shift supervisor does nothing but lie to you none stop and when you go to H.R about it they just believe and side with him. Pay is ok if you one machine now the  new focas "
bad,"7 days A week,Machines Down As Much As Up.People Talk About Each Other.Management Out Of Touch With The People. Cell Leader Very Little Help Just Stand And Watch,Forklift Mad That They Have To Move Racks.After 4yrs I Left."
bad,This was a terrible place to work but I had to do it at the time cause I am a single parent trying to give my kids the best. too many hours. uncaring management.
bad,"Management does not work well with you, and there are many hazardous areas that need attention that management and the union turn a blind eye to."
bad,Lay your butt off for good that's why its shutting down. People wont help talk smack about being 30 seconds late. Good pay but bad attitudes. Older people love snitching.
bad,"In summary good place to work for short term or in-between jobs. Not a great place for long term career, as too many re-organizations, direction- less, incompetent management all looking out for themselves. Business practices are still from 1950s driven by Management on their whims. Chronically understaffed, with work done by interns. Lot of turn over / lay offs due to lack of direction"
bad,"Tenneco is a slave driven workplace.  I would not recommend anyone to work there unless you need to work for a few months just to get you money up. Money can be made, but they also don't care about your life outside of work. All they care about is shocks being shipped out."
bad,They didn't provide proper training.  The atmosphere here wasnt very friendly.  Unless you had been there many many years you were an outsider.  Let go for no reason.
bad,"Long hours , very hot in the summer , very cold in the winter ; but the pay is good .Problem is ; not everyone get's treated the same . Some have to go by the rules and some do not go by the rules . Buddy System  ."
bad,"What can commence (for some) as a golden opportunity can rapidly be manifested as of the most toxic (literally and culturally) atmospheres one can experience; the ideal metric, definition and design regarding exactly how a business/workplace environment should not be."
bad,First off the management seems to think that the employees do not know anything that when it comes to having any type of common sense they know it all and we know nothing.  Second they will tell you one thing and do something else. Third they expect you to have no life outside this place I'm not complaining about the hours but they need three shifts and want it all done in one most lines here only run with minimal staff and one shift. I would advise anyone to stay away from this place if you want any type of life. They talk about competitive pay saying they pay better than other factoires around smithville TN that's a load of bull. Do your research on that. Moving up in the company is ok if you have worked here for 10-12 years then you might advance but other than that no.
bad,Production worker or material handles  would never be considered for a group leader or management positions extremely hard work if management would change it would be a better work environment.
bad,"Tenneco was a good company when I first started out then it all went down hill.No more gain share, incentives, cut the number of people down to run a machine made you do the work of twice as many people.Wont call you even if you don't have to be there."
bad,"It is very quick paste. The plant is very unorganized, messy, poor leadership, they definitely do not care about their employees life's outside of work. All they care about is making sure that the machines are running. We work about 75 to 80 hours a week. They nitpick and look through every crack and crevice just to find something to yell at us about. They may pay good but money will not fix the problems that they have. They have high expectations that we can never meet because of their inoperable machinery that keep having Band-Aids thrown at them and then we get yelled at for not being able to keep up"
bad,"Tenneco, is a stressful place under the auto industry, numbers change often. fast-paced which I can handle, just looking for something different been there 19 years."
bad,"supervisors are terrible,they expect you to work 8 hours a day for 2 1/2 months straight maybe 1 day off the whole time and still have good work ethic"
bad,I was a welder and a set-up at Tenneco .....I have got down graded for listening to my manager of my department told me to do thing did them now when his boss asked why he wouldn't tell them it was his idea and I was listening to him instead he blamed me and now I have no job the work is overall vey easy to get down
bad,"Toda la gente está súper orientada a la producción, lo importante es dar el número aún sobre la gente"
bad,Working at Tenneco is interesting to say the least. The main goal is to ensure that the customer is satisfied and the employees that keep the company going are stressed beyond belief. The production supervisors do the best that they can for its employees and upper management slowly runs the place into the ground. Stay away if you can
bad,"You get moved from one area to the next, don't get trained on the line or machine you were hired for. And when you get sent to other areas people who have been here for awhile treat you like crud. Think you should pick it up first time showed."
bad,"At one time, this company was excellent. Under the leadership of the new CEO and his ""leadership"" team, the culture has devolved into a vicious, nasty place to work. There is little collaboration between functions or sites. Management is happy to burn you out and then kick you out. Shareholder value is the only thing that matters; employees do not. I would never recommend working here unless you are desperate."
bad,The marshall plant 2 management were only concerned about numbers.  Safety and general mindstate of employees were poorly managed with no concern of workers.  Management also actively participated in gossip and showing favortism.  HR never got back to voicemail messages or concerns.
bad,"A typical day at work is going into work not knowing if you will work 2 hrs or 12 hrs, due to the production line not having all of the parts needed to run the orders or the use of faulty bad parts. I learned there is not equal opportunity for all employees, because there are a lot of cliques and favoritism.The hardest part of the job is coping with the negative attitudes of the employees that are favored by Supervisors and upper management. The workplace culture doesn't appreciate the importance of diversity, nor does management  really engage with the employees as they should. They say they promote safety, but they don't really have the employees best interest at heart."
bad,"Initially I thought it was a great place to work. Further in my career, I noticed the lack of good management and poor priorities. Engineering is a far third place to cost and timing. This company will happily do the right thing if it leads to cost/time savings. If not, they cut corners. I have personally witnesses lies to customers and scheming to tell a rosy version of a story when the truth is clearly different."
bad,"Management. Terrible management. Communication between shifts is null. Each shift/ supervisor does things differently. The favoritism isn't even attempted to be hidden. If you have family that has worked here long enough to be buddies with senior management then you can get advancement opportunities with less qualifications than others. Things are very secretive and not shared with employees. Treated like children. I'm not a new person who got let go, I have been with the company for almost a decade. I stay because of the pay. That is the ONLY reason. I know many of my coworkers stay for the same reason."
bad,I worked at tenneco for about ten months. The coworkers are great but management is terrible with communication. I was lucky and was placed on a line that could work six to six and usually had weekends off. in total I probably only worked a month and a half without any days off but most people there work 12 hours 7 days a week it's unhealthy and some people certainly look it. The point system is ridiculous if your late you get half a point past thirty mins it's a whole point if you don't call in you get two points  even with a Drs note you still get a point and you have 7 for the whole year. Benefits are ok but good plans are a little expensive. Make sure you record your time because payroll messes up time to time. Pay is good your definitely gonna earn it.
bad,After being there a month working 12 HR shifts 7 days a week got fired because I told a team lead off for yelling at me and also threatened  me. The management  is horrible  they are not organized at all and they don't care about the employees they just care about getting  parts out
bad,Great place to work and lots of overtime and little pay. Has a huge turnover rate because they are not completely honest.
bad,"In IT they have taken being lean to an extreme.  Little money is spent and usually only when the vendor support fees for the legacy technology is higher then replacement.  IT is viewed as an expense and not a strategic advantage.  The culture is as old fashioned as the antique technology.  'Top Performers' are usually reactive hero types who are somebody's favorite.  You will get more credit if you solve the fire issues and will never be asked how they were allowed to get bad nor how they should be prevented.  The most unprofessional reviews are allowed;  vague, unsupported, and  speculative usually all in the 4th quarter.  The middle band of management requires alot of emotional support from their subordinates.  You will spend good chunks of your day trying to make them feel important.  They will spend more time on how to rebuke you then paying attention to the actual work that needs to be accomplished.  The attitude towards women has not developed with the times. Women are expected to be quiet and compliant.  The less you say as a woman the better you are viewed and rated.  FMLA is still viewed solely as woman's issue."
bad,productive and fun place to work people were nice and courteous  management are fair and just hardest part of my day islocating parts the pay was great
bad,"Former team leader at Lansing mi location. Horrible place to work management is the worst in the industry, they don’t fallow the tenneco values if something goes wrong it’s employees fault. When Group Leads are not taking smoke breaks they will throw you under the rug as fast as they need to. Plant manager has no clue what goes on in the facility.."
bad,"it's companies like this that cause depression in the workplace, you are in work one minute and then told not to bother the next day by text no decency and the management just don't seem to know what they are doing, no communication between them i'll be surprised if they can spell manager let alone work to the dictionaries description."
bad,"There are many unknowns with Tenneco as the business is changing and you could get hired only to have to work in another city too far away for your commute. Your boss can change, even the company you work for, advice is to wait and see - maybe 2020. The new management expects more for less and this company is driven by shareholders perceptions...as are many traded companies. However, the culture is changing and many are looking for new opportunities elsewhere after many years with Tenneco - this speaks volumes. If you do still decide to pursue a Tenneco opportunity,  just know that it is important to pretend like the bonus doesn't exist as if you get one it will be a disappointment."
bad,"This place was by far one of the worst place that I ever worked for. The management team, was self-serving, micro-managing employees, wasn't much opportunity to grow with the company."
bad,"Tenneco is a good company, but they think you should put your family 2nd and I'm not willing to do that. I put in a minimum of 60hrs a week and almost feel guilty when I leave on time."
bad,"El director crea un ambiente laboral muy pesado, demasiado estrés."
bad,good work environment. but i believe there is room for improvement team work plays a big roll especially top management for the plant to improve people are the one who no best for any sagatoins
bad,I worked there for almost 4 years. The company was in a continuous state of decline. Quality was a nonexistent standard there. If you want to make any money you have to practically live there. I ended up working 7 days a week 11 to 12 hours a day for 60+ days at a time before getting a single day off. And then you do it all over again. Management does not care about their employees and are replaced about as fast as their workers.
bad,"Long hours, little support. Wishy/washy upper management."
bad,"Stood in one spot for 12 hrs a day 7 days a week. Hard,physically and mentally, on the body. Hard on family life."
bad,"A lot of office gossip and drama. People seem to be pitted against each other instead of working together as a team. Management definitely expected way too much out of me in an 8 hour shift. I was brought in as a contract employee to do one job, and in order to become a direct hire, had to apply for a different position. All of those responsibilities were expected from me. I left work feeling like I accomplished very little. I was spread too thin and asked for help....only to be told to create training for the initial position. So I walked away with yet more to do...."
bad,This company pays good and has excellent benefits; however they also have very poor management and favoritism is at an extreme high. Supervisors and Human Resources also have lack of communication when it comes to rules and they bend the rules as well. They use profanity and think they can talk to their employees on the floor any kind of way they want. Again very poor management.
bad,"Talent of the employees is not the problem, it is how management is handling the company that is the problem. The company is extremely top heavy with too many VP to employee ratio and too many middle managers."
bad,"When I first started it was t too bad, over the years it's gotten worse. Poor management that refuses to listen, HR department that blatantly lies to it's employees, team members being handed supervisor and other management positions they do not deserve to receive. Pay is the only decent thing here, communication and respect in the workplace however is not. The insurance is ok at best. It's 80/20. You get a 15 cent raise for every 5 years of service, however that's a very lackluster thing to give for someone who has given 5 years of their life to a place like this. The only thing worse than the career advancement here is the reason HR gives for it."
bad,The work environment is automotive so it’s production oriented. The management must be on a quota that dictates bonus. Working with huge amounts of unskilled labor. Tenneco uses job placement firms and new faces continually. Those in skilled trades are treated as work horses. So glad when they payed me off!
bad,"No hay mucho compañerismo, y en RRHH NO respeta a las listas de Contratación, y no vuelve a dar oportunidad algunos que hemos trabajado y demostrado  para volver e incluso seguir con un contrato estable.."
bad,"14 hour days, 7 days a week for 65k a year. no worth it. the facility isn't bad and its a safe place to work, but the overtime gets to be too much. If you dont need a work life balance then this place would be good for you."
bad,"Too stuck in local orders for any strategic panning"
bad,"Previous execs built a deep culture of trust - you had a clear understanding of the corporate objectives, the value of your contributions & knew you had unwavering support.  With the transition to new c-suite execs, the culture has become top heavy and dysfunctional.- as shown in the profitability & stock price."
bad,I would not recommend this place to work for management sucks and it is hard to move up in the factory unless you like to kiss butt the biggest down fall to this place is that if you get injured at work they will try to blame you so they don't have to fix the problem
bad,"Use to be a great place to work with a sense of stability, but within the last year with the never ending lay-offs and the nasty attitudes in the office (Especially HR in the main building) I would not recommend anyone work here."
bad,"Forced breaks at specific times made for long days. Outdoors the conditions were rough due to a dry summer. Management had no clue what we did. A co-worker would play Starcraft in a closet and another spent the whole day walking from bathroom to bathroom due to lack of work. This was the maintenance crew, but I hear the office workers don't have it too good either, long hours and minimal job security from what I've heard."
bad,Tenneco pays good but their management sucks supervisors talk to you however they please and only care about numbers not safety its a very unsafe place to work with constant injuries but hey they pay good so its ok i guess is their thinking.
bad,"Just not a good place to work. Management is a joke there and once you're hired, it's totally different.... Shipping and receiving management is a joke"
bad,"I worked at tenneco for 8 months.  During that time I traveled 100% mostly to plants in KC, Jeffersonville, IN and Elhart, IN.  The quality culture is the worst I've seen in my 30 years in automotive.  I tell my friends to STAY AWAY.  The money is great.  Leadership is terrible and they will work you until you ""break""."
bad,My experience at Tenneco wasn't so great I worked really hard out there but never got shown any appreciation i was there almost a year I didn't have any points and I had perfect attendance but never got hired in.
bad,"Job culture not the greatest because you have crazy or inappropriate coworkers, but aside from that they try to provide training and give you more responsibility if you show initiative."
bad,Working for Tenneco Automotive has given me a great foundation of experience and knowledge. I have averaged a sixty hour work week in an engineering environment.
bad,I worked there for a little while and there are a lot of jobs to learn if willing . I believe that it is a good place to start fresh from high school
bad,I liked the people I worked with but the mandatory twelve hour shifts six days a week is unacceptable. The breaks are really short and the work itself is strenuous. I was expected to lift over a hundred pounds with no support usually on a daily basis. The machines are neglected and the PPE is inadequate for the job. The pay is decent but considering how much fiberglass and metal I had in my hands through the gloves on a daily basis made a twelve hour day very long. The company has potential but as of now it's not looking promising.
bad,"I enjoyed working with this company but as changes were being made their became a lot of lying, backstabbing. The leadership was not very professional. There was a lot of things going on in now that should never have happened. The hardest part was dealing with a bunch of negative people. The most enjoyable part was doing my job because it gave me satisfaction."
bad,not a good work place to hard to move up to a higher paying job. it need to improve a lot on safety. need a lot of work in and outside of the plant.
bad,"Tenneco was a very indepent job that required individual job setup, and labor that had to consist of non stop quotes demanded from management. Ive leared a lot during the job with Tenneco, due to the fact that it was needed to stay afloat with the company and the job that I had and skill sets of the Cnc's and Acme machines."
bad,The days with this company were long and exhausting. We worked over daily and never new to the last minute if we had the weekends off and even then things could change. This was hard on me and my family because we never could plan anything and I was always tired. I didn't mind the work so much just the demands they put on us and pressure. The hardest part of the job was the way the line was set up it made our jobs harder as far as getting our parts and production. The best part was time to clock out. Management often said one thing and did another.
bad,"É uma empresa boa de trabalhar não atrasa pagamento, tem bons beneficio"
bad,Mother plant company culture is good but as i am working in a green field project a new plant so it is more challenging as well as more learning scope but there is no Time limit of work
bad,The job was great. Learned a lot. Fast pace environment. Robotic weld and pressure gauge of pipes and mufflers. Great company place to work for but lacks people to run sufficiently.
bad,"Tenneco has a lot of paperwork that has to be done daily.  My problem with them is they do not properly train everybody.  Some people have to do more work than others because of how many presses they were trained on compared to the next.  The guidelines for running 2 presses were established years ago because of people getting so good at their job they had time to mess around.  The company now expects new employees to be able to do the same with only a week or 2 of training compared to people who have done it for 10 years."
bad,"Mandatory overtime all the time.  I have seen people work 7 days a week, 12 hrs a day for 7 months without a day off (including Holidays)  sure you make good money...but you have no LIFE.  There has been more than one employee either drop dead on the floor or have a stroke in the parking lot at the facility I worked at in Hartwell"
bad,"A Tenneco parou no tempo há muito tempo, deixou de investir nos funcionários e não tem desejo de mudança."
bad,treated their employees poorly in that they didn't really care about your family commitments.  all they cared about was about your attendance to work.  they employed less people than really needed and had mandatory overtime at the expense of your family
bad,"I got treated unfairly. Didn't get reviews like I was told I would. I was on 90 day probation to hire. Saw boss only 3 times.During one and only review he told HR lady to sit and say nothing. Did same to her last day when he let me go. I made suggested improvements from one and only review. He was bent on letting me go, no reasoning with him what so ever. I told him this would devastate me. From day one word was if I had any issues to let me know so I could handle them.Paycheck opened when given to me, never called me on radio. They had it out for me, I don't know why. Jealousy I guess. Biggest screw job I have ever gotten from any employer. Leadman and apprentice multiple mistakes, was told by him not to say anything about it."
bad,There were almost no days off for the period of time I worked there and no end in sight.  The departments I worked in were the dead last to get a day off even if the rest of the plant was not working. The repetitive motion was killing my fingers. I was very glad to get out of there.  You would really have to like that environment or have no other options for work.
bad,The job is very fast paced and stressful but they do offer great pay and excellent benefits. There is a big lack of communication between shifts and you only get 2 15 minute breaks a day
bad,Tenneco Management Team were too focused on making the quota and not enough on quality.  The overall quality of the product is sub par.  The values of myself and the management did not align
bad,Monday-Saturday 12 hours days 1st or 2nd shift.. no matter what excuse is if you miss a day its an automatic write up. If the line is not constantly working then that line get sent home for the day.
bad,pues todo era un dia pesado cuando llegaba no tenia buena relacion con mis compañeros yo me enfocaba en lo mio y no les parecia que me apartara yo nunca he visto el trabajo como un juego y eso a ellos no les paracia por eso no me llevaba bien con algunos de ellos
bad,Tenneco will work you into the ground. there is a ton of work to do there and if you are salary then that just means you are free over time. expect nightly calls back in and to fix the same things over and over because no one will enforce any corrective actions.
bad,The rubber injection supervisor in particular ruins the work experience for low tier workers by threatening write ups and termination if people make mistakes. Very bad communication between supervisors and production employees. The 2nd shift supervisor could care less about workplace safety even though he preaches about it everyday in the safety meetings. Regular maintenance on machines is shrugged off which resulted in a fire over Christmas break. Overall it was a great place to work but the supervisors make it unbearable if you’re low tier.
bad,"Tenneco, Litchfield Michigan facility has a lot of potential to be GREAT but it lacks in some key areas."
bad,"This job is extremely stressful and is hard labor, especially as you get older. It's nice pay and can make a difference at home as an additional income. But expect to work for it."
bad,"a good place to work if you're looking for a lot of hours, but it's loud and they require that you wear ppe (sleeves, earplugs, safety glasses etc),  benefits are ok, friendly people, but they don't treat their employees very well. they don't stick to the handbook, they do things however they want and get away with it."
bad,they were always changing ur schedule with little time for making arrangements outside of work worked long hours and no days off made the workplace stressful and tiring
bad,"- Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. "
bad,"Fast Paced, poor management, though I heard it is better than it used to be. Extreme favoritism some people have to work hard, while others walk around and do nothing, it is all who you know job quality means little"
bad,"Poor management. Over worked employees. Good pay and benefits, but NOT family oriented. Give no consideration to employees when actually needed. Only care about quanity."
bad,"The department I worked in pulled a lot of overtime. It was good money, but sometimes you need a balance. The low rating was due to the fact I was injured on the job due to faulty machinery that had been written up for safety violations several times. I endured 4 surgeries now and got released because I wasn't physically able to do the job. Now I'm trying to find work with my limitations."
bad,good money but alot of cobbled together machinery that runs maybe twice a week consistently if that much. Solid company platform with somewhat safety first mentality but hitting rate is most important.
bad,"Been working there since 2010 and it's been a whirlwind the whole time.  They have little or no respect for the working floor laborers. Management and team leaders are so clueless its ridiculous because they are ""supposed to have college educations"". It's like modern day slavery.  You work sun up to sun down literally. HR,  management, team leader, and employees have a HIGH turnover rate, but nobody cares. HR also does NOT keep personal situations confidential.  Nothing is secret that happens to you...Management will walk right by you and not speak or even smile. Pay is pretty good and you can make a nice check cause overtime is mandatory every week.  Even when they say that they are giving you a weekend off it's usually a lie... (Management are nothing, but a bunch of liers). Salary workers walk around like they are gods gift to the world with no consideration for the people who are actually on machine doing the work so everyone can be paid. They also make up jobs in order for the ""favorites"" to have it easy,  but then say that the plants broke.  In order to move up you gotta know someone or kiss a** all day. Floor workers are okay,  but because of the excessive hours people can get cranky. Telling HR anything or having them handle things either gets messed up or not done.  It's best to call corporate cause once you bring up an issue management targets you as a problem... "
bad,a very demanding workplace.  not family oreiented.  extremly strressful to work in.  the pay is the best.  work long hrs at the drop of a dime
bad,òtima empresa pra quem esta começando ou ja trabalha em algum ramo!
bad,Hot around 95 degrees in the summer with only minimal air movement. Poor management with inexperienced employees. You work everyday anywhere from 8-12 hours with no sitting while on the job. No loitering allowed just alot of bosses watching you as if they have no other job to do. Quality techs are inexperienced and poorly trained.
bad,"Start the night off with stretching exercises, be informed of quota for the night, unless someone was being trained rotation stayed the same, change tips on welder, fill out station control sheets, then commence to welding."
bad,inspecting parts that came directly of the machine. I had to seperate the bad parts from the good. Management was management and did their job. co-workers worked together as they were suppose to. most emjoyable part about this job was the job I was responsible for. 
bad,very dirty and greasy place.  always having machine fail with automation and sticking on production line.  constant work stoppages and resets
bad,"The pay is great ! You work a lot of overtime , if your the type of person who wants to constantly work , no days off , limited vacation , very fast paced , and quick break times . This is a place for you ."
bad,"People there are great work long hours but the workers are friendly and nice. Jobs are easy and pay is good, Kong’s hours working while some ppl are just standing around tho."
bad,"I've been there for less than two years and in that time there was a ""reorganization"" and as I was let go because of another ""reorganization"".  As I see it, Tenneco doesn't quite know what direction they want to go in.  They aren't rudderless, but they have clear vision.  If you want that kind of company, then go for it."
bad,It’s a job with good pay and benefits but stressful on your home life and hard to get a day off to do things not very laid back place to work but it was a good job while it lasted
bad,"I was fairly young  when i started working here and everyone else was older so they loved picking fun at me, the work was fast paced and depressing. breaks were short."
bad,I use to love working here and was proud but the company has one bad sale month even though there is a lot of changes with equipment and such. The upper management and new HR are not workable people.
bad,"They are not consistent with their quality requirements. Sometimes they'll call a part bad, and fix/adjust the machine...while other times they'll call it good, because they need the part."
bad,"Poor management and poor supervision, It was extremely hot there, they would change your hours without any notice and you just had to go with it. The team leader was a pervert that stalked us as we were working and showed us inappropriate pictures of himself on his phone and nothing was done about it."
bad,I will never work there again..and the Union sucks.......................they supervisors are lazy & the team leads think their supervisor . I would not recommend Tenneco to anyone especially my family .
bad,"Management is less concerned with employee retention than maintaining Status quo. "
bad,"No se tienen objetivos bien definidos, gente muy joven en las operaciones claves."
bad,"Good pay    but stressful.  The building is very hot in the summer and cold in the winter.  I worked in the office for the past 8 years, so it wasn't  as bad."
bad,The do not follow guideline of employee work requirements and make their workers work up to 180 with no days off. over 78 hours a week for some workers and very high rollover rate.
good,they do not care about you esp when you get hurt on the job... and they are not a good company to work for and they have had many complaints on them and they don't care about your safety
good,"It is limited what I can say, due to the factory closing. Their pay was one of the top in the area for the line of work. It is a shame the quality standard plummeted when the announcement of the closing was released."
good,I don't mean to bad mouth the company that pays my bills. However they often work us 12 hrs a day 6 days a week. All that is given up in your personal life working here and the thanks is to have your job cut just to bid on another job in the company for less pay and ending up doing your old job and more.
good,Niskie zarobki i zła atmosfera.braki w pracowników .wymagania ponad norme
good,Has become a company that doesn't care how many hours you work or how many days strait you have worked. There is constant weekend overtime can't make plans on weekends with your family unless you take a vacation day. Shouldn't have to take a vacation day just to go somewhere over to weekend all the time
good,"I worked there 7 years,welding also operating numerous machines.They also had me doing others jobs as count on materials,and its 12 hrs a day 7 days a week"
good,"Empresa sem plano de carreira , difícil promoção , quando tem vagas, apenas pessoas com influencia consegue promoção. Para quem quer um dia ter uma posição melhor , não é melhor lugar , muita pressão cobrança e pouco reconhecimento salarial ."
good,"it is  a good MNC company.there is available good safty environment,"
good,"Processes can be improved for better turn around, and more time coaching as well as training is key. Roll over for point systems can be improved for entry level employees also."
good,"Great, hard working co-workers. A ""put out fires"" environment."
good,"clean environment, friendly staff,very competitive job,nice place to work"
good,"Los mandos intermedios se encuentran totalmente desamparados y solos ante la plantilla , sin recibir apoyo de sus jefes."
good,This is a high pace job where they want numbers! The pay is fair but would always be nice to have more. I have worked there a long time and would have been nice to have been shown a little more appreciation for the long term commitment that I have given them.
good,"Same old song and dance, No room for advancement unless you are liked by the hire ups. if you have a friend in leadership you will do fine here. the place is ran like a high school."
good,"Work loads are unobtainable"
good,"I work to many hours and the management sucks, the people there are cut throat. They don't care about having family only care about making a dollar. They just want to be rich and they know their people will not leave"
good,Stable environment. Safe environment. Good group of people to work for and with. Learn something new everyday. Various new opportunities for different people and growing together as a company
good,typical factory work. show up do your job and leave. Tenneco did not seem to be too engaged in their employees overall well being. hours are good unless you have a family.
good,See ratings above that tell the tale of many managers at Tenneco-Elkhart. Very political decisions made day to daty and on committees that affected the morale and work ehic of managers and floor employees.
good,"The company is your typical automotive company, and if you know what that means, you should know what to expect. Tenneco does not go above or beyond average in anything it does. The location of the engineering facilities are not desirable and if one wishes to live in any reasonable location, expect to commute at least 40 minutes 1 way. The environment is relaxed, and the people are generally good to work with, but only on the working level. The management is a mess and has been shuffling for quite some years now. Don't expect clear direction most of the time, as you will be probably running from one fire to another. The company is perpetually understaffed, so expect to be overworked."
good,"Tenneco has two plants,Its very loud there and ear plugs are a must but they pay very well and usually the overtime is there if you want it. Tenneco makes mufflers for Ford and Chrysler and the jobs range from making small parts to the larger final assembly."
good,During my time at Tenneco I was able to train in a lot of areas. The overtime was 12 hour days 5 days a week and on the weekends it was 10 hour days sometimes 8 hour days.     Management was disorganized. HR department was also disorganized.
good,"Been at the Greenville plant for 3+ years and it has definetly had its ups and downs, Be ready for over time worked 46 of 52 weeks in a year with optional 10s and 12s. the pay is good for the work that is done and the others you work around will help make the time nice. worst part is definetly management."
good,Manufacturing shock absorber for cars all every components for shock absorber are manufacture here itself. I m the part of R&D department I learn every thing about shock absorber and learned how handle the customer
good,"The ENTIRE supervising staff is clueless, and unwilling to pull together to make things better. It is NOT the “team” atmosphere that is lead on to believe, atleast at the Smithville plant. Very toxic work environment. The supervisors are unconcerned with daily activities of the production lines. If it isn’t on paper, then the chances are they do no know. They play favorites regardless of how it affects morale. They make no effort to make their activities helpful to anyone but themselves. TRAINING TRAINING TRAINING. Chances are that will not be enough, so I’d recommend removing them all and start from scratch. The employees that do try, are driven off by an atmosphere that does not support them. They are used until they’ve finally had enough and quit."
good,This company was a good place to work in the beginning. They do pay well as supervisors are paid overtime and the starting wage is good.Change of management has been hard and many good people were let go.
good,Present management is run by the good old boys club. If you can go and not want advancement or acknowledgement for anything you do this may be the place for you.
good,"Nice compensation and benefits but a toxic environment"
good,"Worked everyday for 5 months straight, and just as soon as i got an up in pay, they let me go. Management is awful and no organization at all. The pay was phenomenal though."
good,due to miss management the employees are  made to work crazy hours 7 days a week 12 HR days because part shortages and down time
good,"En un día típico se atienden líneas de producción y se resuelven problemas: eléctricos, control, mecánicos, neumáticos, hidráulicos y se sigue los tiempos de paro para no afectar la producción."
good,a normal work day is 12 hours 7 days a week which leaves you no time to live life. the managment is very poor and the job is pretty easy
good,Mitarbeiter werden nicht nach Leistung gezahlt! Wer Schleimt kommt weiter oder wer keinen deutschen Pass hat! Man wird erpresst das man Wochenende zum arbeiten kommt!
good,The pay here is really good but the production and business level of this company isn't stable at all. They do a lot of shutdowns and layoff without no warning at all and these layoffs are not paid for.
good,"Now management is secretive and constantly changing plans, decisions, etc.  Employee engagement continues to plummet.  Employees are unsure of their future."
good,It's not a horrible place to work but they will work you to death and not care to fire you over sometime stupid. But you can make good money if your work alot of over time. They are very unorganized and can't keep product you need to run the parts you need.
good,Upper management needs alot of improvement. Pay is good. Would be better if they didn't have favoritism or my buddy attitude. Still better than most factory's
good,The company doesn’t appear to care whether or not the employees are burned out sand have employees work months straight with no days off. They don’t try to work with team members to have time to rest
good,The management doesn’t follow gm rules really should be sued but that’s none that’s my business. Like drill holes to get rattles out of exhaust fix a weld that has more than a 20% cut. It’ll be another Smithville
good,It was a great working experince and a very fruit ful learning experince with great management capabilities and great working relations amongst workesrs
good,"Nonstop band-aid repairs, dont like to fix things correctly or get parts to do the job right,dont really have a training program, just throw you into the pool,management is terrible"
good,"learned correct names of parts to put on shock build-up, read B.O.M., learned where parts are stored, no climate control very very hot or cold in workplace. really didnt have outside life worked 7 days a week 10 to 12 hours days"
good,I started out in a good department with much support and very little shutdown time. after a little over a year I got moved to a different department where my layoff time was increased a lot. I couldn't make a living from Dec to July due to too many layoffs for lack of work. I used all my vacation time during this time to get a decent paycheck after the shutdowns which caused problems with occurances later on. August to December makes the best money and some overtime. The job in the first department was more of a variety of machines to operate which made the job more enjoyable. The second department was a more mind numbing monotonous job. I tried several times to transfer to a different department with no luck as my supervisor liked my work too much.
good,"points for many small purpose.team superviser not fair"
good,Tenneco is a very strong and growing company.  The overall structure of the departments is very sound.
good,"Tenneco Automotive in Hartwell, Ga has no compassion for its employees.A week at Tenneco involves working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week.A day involves long, strenuous labor in a very poor ventilated building.The management does not care about your well being, to give you rest, or protect you from harm.We recently have been fined by OSHA because of very high levels of chromium in the air inside or facility, yet we continue to work. I have great co-workers who share a concern in health working here, and they are the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"empresa boa para trabalhar, agradável e com pessoas educadas"
good,Better to work here if you don’t have a family because they kinda put work over family to the point where you have no life besides working. But other then that the pay is great I’d go back.
good,"Empresa é boa mais tem pessoas incopetentes no comando, isso torna o ambiente de trabalho um tanto estressante e desmotivador para crescimento."
good,Continual management changes and culture change programs. Facility is being extensively upgraded. Lots of overtime available but not always voluntary.
good,"Jedná se o výrobu výfukových systémů do automobilů."
good,"OK Company, nothing special. Go in and work, don't communicate with other people outside of your group. Not the friendliest people work at the company."
good,"Company was great to work for until the big push for profits, then everything became based on number of parts coming off of end of line. Quality and production has dropped because of this. Also budget has been so tight that machine repairs are pieced together."
good,"Hard work, repetitive movements that are poor for joints. Managers are hard to communicate with. Very hot in summer. Will take years to get on first shift. So be content on second shift. Can’t work your way to a higher title because it’s union."
good,"no systems in place to make work life more simple.  very poor communication. "
good,"My honest opinion about Tenneco is they pay great and they have great benefits but they work us way to much, I never have time for my family and they are not considerate of family situations. It’s not a place to work if you have little children"
good,"products are good, pay was good, unfortunately writing is on the wall and management changed from being fair and reasonable to....... .... ... .... .... ..."
good,"Good pay, insurance is offered but expensive, point system is used for attendance.  Safety is a priority at Tenneco!  Some of the departments work long hours on a daily basis, while others do not.  Some of the parts handled are heavy, fast paced if machines are running correctly."
good,"Extremely fast paced environment. "
good,"We lift in positions that could have ended up hurting myself from the smallest turn. It was fairly clean. "
good,"typical day busy but organized"
good,"Entrada ás 7 da manhã com saída ás 15/16 da tarde, com pequenas pausas durante manhã e tarde e 30 minutos de almoço."
good,Learned about mufflers assemblies. But management wasn't the greatest. Coworker were friendly and helpful. Hardest part was management.
good,"I worked at Tenneco going almost a year now this has been a up and down experienced, because I went from 40-60 per hour a week to right now working under 40 hours."
good,"At Tenneco, I was a technician, I had many great individuals I developed a working and personal relationship with.  I still keep in contact with those individuals and seek advice and guidance from.  The issue I had with Tenneco was the lack of advancement opportunities and the uncertainty of it's financial future.  I am an ambitious person who works hard to try to move up, however, I was never given any clear direction to advance, despite numerous attempts.  I even spoke with HR about and they said, that information has to come from your supervisor.  I spoke to him and he said, I will have to speak with the Chief Engineer about the requirements.  I waited a month, then approached the Chief Engineer, and he said, I will have to set up a game plan with my supervisor.  Nothing ever came out of it."
good,A typical day at Tenneco can be very stressfull. You just have to rise above it all and do the best you can.
good,Its a job. Ive worked in places worse than this. Doing a good job and going above and beyond does not get noticed. Its a union company so there aren't a lot of opportunities for advancement.
good,"They require 2 shifts too handle a 3 shift operation. This results in massive over time all year.they will cut your job and repost it at a lower pay grade to save money on hourly workers( they told us that's the reason) and in the same week , promote salaried personnel."
good,"Management didn't do their job when people were slacking off, I did my job and someone else's because they would slack off and drop numbers, team lead would play on his phone the whole shift, supervisor thought she was above everybody and could do and say what she wanted."
good,That is the Devil Plant. You will spen more time at work then you will at home. Not a family plant. You will make money but it's not worth losing your family. mangers have favorites
good,A good opportunity to start a career and learn about the automotive industry. Being a $8Bn company there is a great amount of exposure and experience that can be gained in working with Tenneco especially if you want to work in cross functional and  international teams. Cons include upper management lacking direction and vision for the company and thus unable to position itself in the market currently.
good,I am  currently working third shift and was supposed to have started on first. I did not start off with the agreed pay rate. I haven’t been assigned to a trainer.
good,"no review at this time as I am still employed at Tenneco and do not wish to complete this item at this time. "
good,Ogólnie nie jest to zła firma ale jak na taką pracę niskie zarobki
good,"Empresa instável com relação aos seus gestores (desde presidencia ao nivel de coordenação) na área comercial, RH e produção."
good,"Direct middle managers were good but the layer above at the director level and C level leave a lot of desired leaderhips traits on the table.  More attention needs to be paid to the thoughts of the front line as they. have better insight than the leaders, on technical, logistic and even strategic direction."
good,"I do not regret working there. Managment doesn't keep its employees in the loop though.  Pay was decent, lots of nice people there. If you can work hard you can make a decent living"
good,"Very hard work, but the pay is good.  Not very much time off at all, year round.  7 days a week,  sometimes 50 to 70 hour work weeks.  VERY HOT in summer,  the fall and winter aren't too bad.  I recommend working at the plant over working at the DC though,  DC has all the hours and no lives,  no time for a life,  its really quite sad."
good,"Good team bond amongst shopfloor employees. Staff are treated badly especially by HR. HR department are awful. No procedures in place for managing sickess, absences or general queries. Generally unhelpful."
good,"New business, still working out kinks in all departments.  Lots of staff turnover and openings. Some management inexperienced."
good,The benefits and the wages are excellent but they really do not take care of the work force well.  You can work for a month or two without an off day and be mandated to stay over during the week.  No real consideration for the employee and family
good,"Working at Tenneco isn't an easy job. Hard work. Very physical. None stop work unless its your break. Took about 2 month's for my body to adjust to the work, please keep in mind I am a female and mostly men doing these jobs and this was one of the hardest jobs I have had. After my body getting used to the work It wasn't so had. Started getting easier and the I could work faster. Co workers wore nice to work with. Lots of complaints. From co workers every day about the job. The pay was good."
good,a typical day at work is clocking in going to the work station; completing tasks and going home. There is not too many options for advancement unless you know someone in higher positions.
good,"Fairly good benefits but way too much over time. Also, bad labor management. There are too many people in some areas and not enough in others. The pay is good though for the type of work."
good,"Immature computer systems"
good,Not a very demanding job other than you end up working 7 days a week all the time and it just wears you down. There are some oppertunities for improvement but most require that you go to off shifts. The management does not always listen and comunicate very well.
good,work was easy straight 8 6-2 most of my co-workers where ok a lot of them were older easy to make friends but. I learned if management ask for your honest opinion don't give it! hardest part of job was being watched like a zoo animal. most enjoyable part was how easy and fast paced work was
good,aprendi muchas cosas como aser amortiguadores para q sirven lasw piezas
good,"Tenneco would be better served if communications between shifts were improved, so the oncoming shift wouldn't lose production time looking for difficulties experinced by previous shift."
good,"I spend 50% of my day in crisis management, 25% tactical and 25% strategic activities. The company senior leadership is not transparent to goals and methods to achieve them."
good,"I have worked At Tenneco Lincoln,Ne"
good,"Being efficient to do the job the right way the firstEvery time"
good,Usually have mandatory overtime working at least 6 days a week paycheck is nice every week and good benefits but its stressful due to old equipment and management not listening to the crew well
good,I enjoy staying busy.  Fast paced.  The end of the comes real fast when you have full load.   Most of the time I look up and most of the day had gone by.
good,was a fast pace and very oily job. when machines would go down some of the cordinators would be rude to the operator. depending what dept you got it could be a great place.
good,The management there does not give you the opportunity to advance. Most of them are clueless at what is going on and don't know how to run a successful business
good,"I do not mind working at Tenneco, but like any corporate run business it takes a long time for things to move whether it be promotions or trying to get projects done."
good,"work is close to home pay is decent management has declined I have learned severals job during my 30 plus years. presently there are no career advancement there have been a lot of jobs cut. work with some great people learned to work as a team. lead by example workplace culture has declined changes in HR led to a lot of favoritism verses most qualified people when it comes to job bidding I give my very best to my job to fill my obligations, communicate well with others.hardest part of job is ensuring lines have parts to have a productive day when things happen out of my control like late shipments or component deparments not making parts on time. most enjoyed is working with good people and have a productive day."
good,Tenneco needs to work on communication from upper management through floor operators.  I believe most communication stops at shift supervisors and is not relayed to operators until the last minute.
good,It's a fast pace work area but sometimes parts were not available and we would get chewed up for it when it's the fork lift driver who doesn't bring the parts we would need
good,"This is automotive.  Good pay, but fast paced.  Decent benefits.  Sometimes its hard to see how you could progress in your career.  Company should invest in their equipment and invest in automation."
good,Great jobs and good pay here. Working almost every day 12 hours a day is only real drawback for this job. No time to enjoy family or anything else in life.
good,Fast paced. Can be stressful. Rapidly changing company that requires much patience and flexibility. Can be very stressful due to lack of training and support.
good,"Good place too work, needs improvement on the 3rd shift side of things as far as management goes. Could also do with a better HR representative in MP2"
good,"Management absolutely does not care to lie to your face. No incentive to work harder. No days off unless you use your own points. Poor management and allocation of resources guarantees that you have to work 12 hours a day every day of the week. Thankless, awful job but it pays wonderfully."
good,"(Seward facility)  The benefits are greats as well as the opportunities for overtime in some departments.  The focus on quality is not very solid and there is a sense of favoritism in the plant.  "
good,"Good starting place for young engineers!! "
good,Gostava muito de trabalhar nesta empresa por ter me dado oportunidade de crescimento dentro dela e de ser localizada próximo a minha residência.
good,"My typical day at Tenneco was you come in, stretch, grab your PPE (proper protective equipment) and go to your line and run it all day. I learned a lot about machines and how to run various ones. Even fix them when they break down. I wished that management was more involved in each line to learn their problems and insights on what they thought could improve productivity. My coworkers were great, positive and happy people that were fun to be around and made the work day go by much smoother. The hardest part of the job was when the machine was down or when we were in a changeover because it was hard to find work to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to fix the problems on the machines."
good,"What once was a good place to work came out of the financial down turn in '09 doing well because of the cuts and sacrifices that were made,but when times started to improve the mindset never changed.  Machines will run for awhile with no preventative maintenance,but after so long the little things that don't get taken care of or just patched together and never fixed properly turn into big expensive fixes. Management still want production,but doesn't want to spend any money to maintain the machinery. Eventually it creates a bad work enviroment."
good,Weld quality exhaust at production rate. Run cnc and robotic welders.
good,"a typical day required i show up 10minutes early on average to begin prepping the cell for the day ahead. hours fluctuated, anywhere from an 8 - 12hour shift and overtime was mandatory without question. "
good,"Boa para aprendizado, em uma empresa de grande porte e multinacional..."
good,"it is a good place to start building job skills, You move around alot doing the same job just different machines.  Sometimes a person gets to learn different jobs."
good,"The work is interesting and fast paced. The work environment is weary and raw. Work security and position support is scarce. My only experience is at the Hartwell facility, but the general consensus is that this ""every man for himself"" attitude trickles down from corporate."
good,"My tyical day at work starts at 11 p.m. becasue I work third shift. We have two fifteen minute breaks throuhout the eight hour shift. The job itself is physically demanding. On average order pickers walk approximetly 8-10 miles a shift. Some of my co-workers are enjoyable but since we work a ton of weekends, most are not happy to be there. The hardest part of the job is being away from my family so much and working third shift. The most enjoyable part of my job is the money and health benifits."
good,Trying make sure requirements were met on time.
good,Steady work flow
good,"Tenneco Litchfield prefers a ""head down and mouth shut"" environment. Some members are better than others. Safety is the highest priority at Tenneco Litchfield with upper management. Supervisors and down will follow this until it interferes with production or shipping timetables. Overall the experience was positive, but a few bad apples can ruin the whole batch"
good,Das Unternehmen muss sich täglich neuen Herausforderungen stellen weswegen es äußerst schnell mit einstellen und entlassen ist.
good,Decent place to work. No major complaints. There is no work from home policy. there are opportunities for growth depending on your skills and line of operation.
good,Boa para trabalhar que os colaboradores tentam se ajudar
good,Other schemes such as GET can be trusted in this company and can be trusted for good package and facilities.Also hectic working culture as difficult to cope up for freshers.
good,"Good environment , good teamwork & friendly colliques , starting the daily target was very tough & challenging for me & later 1 month i was learned the tricks & tactics & use my different ideas to acheive the target very easily with the help of my friendly colliques & i enjoyed a lot."
good,"That had great benefits, great pay, vacation hours, good people to work with. But very long hours and it added stress, lack professional positions that are needed. No line leaders."
good,"I have learn a lot about  run a robot as a machine operator. and meeting dead lines on time. Hard work, team work, gets the job done. and there no I in team working at Tenneco."
good,"I was given the ability to do whatever I needed to do to improve the plant. Once I was there for a while I was ""the guy"" when it came to fixing machines or knowing the history. Management made the job unbearable. Raises and bonuses were practically nonexistent. The hands on work was the best."
good,It was decent managers just needa be more respectful to workers and understanding to peoples current situations in life its fairly a decent job though
good,Was a great place to work. but it is closing down in the city of owen sound. To bad for all the people that work there and have to find new jobs. Good luck people!
good,It just depends who you work with and when you work. But other then that pay is good and overtime out the wazoo. Poor management and horrible teamwork.
good,"Overall, the company will provide you with the tools you need to survive - stable work environment, great pay, vacation, 401K, etc."
good,Start out maxed out on pay and can get promotions but if you work there you don’t have much out a life outside of it management is ok In some areas and better in others also if you like drama and wondering if your going to get fired when you walk in the door then that’s the place for you
good,Don’t care about their employees but if you need money and can do the work then it’s worth working. It’s hard and hot. Good insurance. Good benefits. Not a lot of lay offs.
good,A typical day at work is doing assigned jobs in certain weld cells. On occasion help out other departments. Deliver quality parts on a timely manner and work as a team.
good,Decent pay  but long hours be ready to work. if you're not ready to work 6 or 7 days a week this may not be for you. on the upside they do have bonuses.
good,Safe environment Everyone’s friendly and willing to help you learn when you don’t have anything to do at your area you move to a different department to help
good,good money. management could be better. Some managers care about you. some are incompetent and will drag you down. If they need to blame you for their own problems they will throw you under the bus.
good,"Buenos salarios "
good,Challenging work environment. Lots of employee turnover. Great team to work with. lots of overtime. quality department was well organized. very few conflicts
good,I made great money and it was a great place to work. When the market took a hit in 2009 my entire line was laid off. We were under the impression that we would eventually be called back to work but that never happen so I moved on.
good,Provides a paycheck weekly to provide for my family but does not treat workers equally. Discrimination and unfair management practices are an issue. They pick and chose who and how to discipline and when
good,"Being a Production Supervisor in automotive manufacturing is unlike most any other industry.  It pays well comparatively, until you factor in how much of a time commitment you must give to compensate for personnel shortages, production inefficiencies, and  overall mismanagement."
good,best part of job is always learning new things. fellow workers easy to get along with and helpful. Working midnight shift not the greatest but compensated well.
good,"This place is fast paced.  Office politics are plenty.   Hardest part of job is not being part of the information circle.  Many people wanting work done, but not enough people to do it."
good,"um bom lugar de se trabalhar, pessoas dispostas a ajudar caso não saiba de alguma coisa."
good,The job was fast paced and occurred between separate buildings.  The job was pleasant.  Weather was a factor as well as lower pay for the cost of living in my area.
good,"If your looking to work here just know two things before you start. The first is that you will work seven days a week for a long time upwards to a year or at least six months. Second communication is nonexistent whether it's trying, to find a supervisor or team lead you will not be able to preform your job duties unless you talk to them first."
good,Good place to make money but not a place you can also make time for yourself or family. They lose people like they bring them in and that it because of all the overtime and the training isn’t done very well. Most management doesn’t know how to talk to their people.
good,"We worked way too much to have a balance between work and family. Management was alright, They sometimes listened to concerns.Coworkers were somewhat friendly."
good,While I worked there i enjoyed learning different aspects of the job. The pay was good the work was steady paced. I would recommend this place for a good place to work.
good,"all the work there requires a fast-pace movement, the condition of job is average, but depends on weather & temperature ( no air-conditioning excepts the office). Most of management team are up from experiences, there is good side for it, however, Tenneco needs changes, improvement. I don't think the old personels with the old ways could make a move, would the management faces with the new approachment make the change ?"
good,It's a okay place to work need some improvements there but for most part not bad you can live off the job I've been there6yrs now they have great benefits they do give you yearly raises for cost of living are busy times are threw the summer time
good,run around fixing down machines within a couple of minutes on a low budget so there wasnt any production time lost very stressful place and fast paste
good,You jave to be a quick learner fast amd ready to go .This type of work environment is not for everyone if u hav not worked in productoin this may not be suitable for u overall its a great place to work .
good,"Working at Tenneco was ok, the only problem I had was I had to travel an hr to get to work. I would recommend working there. I just didn't like the travel."
good,Extremely fast paced. Can be dangerous.  Very hot in the summer.  Dirty place to work.  Can't wear nice clothes to work.  Very physically demanding.  The pay is good though.  Always opportunity for overtime.
good,"fast paced and exciting, management staff was excellent, a lot of support to the production floor. morale was good in the plant. job was very enjoyable"
good,Okay place to work. Mandatory overtime 12 hrs a day 7 days a week. Management was lacking and not ideal. Good money but you basically give your life away.
good,Tenneco Hartwell is a 60 year old facility that has not been kept up but the workforce is good and most managers are okay.  I enjoyed my time at Tenneco but the continuous road blocks to initiate CI projects to help improve efficiency and quality were more than anyone can take.  The employees have gotten to a point to where they just take what is and have no drive to be better.
good,Work in the Talent Acquisition Department in addition to assisting with Diversity and Inclusion goals.  Supported 9 manufacturing plants across the USA
good,Maintenance team lead  is a passive aggressive jerk that will cut your throat to make himself look good in a heart beat  production turn over was high but fair the head manager has a tough job and does the best he can with the people he has to work with
good,Plant 2 had too many layoffs.It took to long to receive unemployment and by the time you receive it you are back to work. I also didn't like the fact certain people can miss more days than others.
good,"Great interpersonal work environment"
good,"producing parts from schedule,I learned part quality, do it right the first time,the management moved progressively in the department ,the aim was to work safe produce quality parts , with continuous improvement, the hardest part of job dealing with climate, working with the people."
good,"Tenneco required overtime, usually 12hr shifts, 6or 7 days a week.  It made it hard to have much of a life outside of Tenneco.  They were also very strict on the attendance policy"
good,Easy to make a living with good family work balance but no real money in it.  Advancement is limited as the positions to the top are few - so good and bad depending on what your looking for in the long run.  Good first job but won't be your last. Most likely a good starter job.
good,you work long hours with very little family time and you do more than just your job the machines are old and outdated and most of the time it was so hot in the factory poor ventilation and communication was a joke between manag
good,"management is poorly in every area, they have their favorites that get by with anything, don't train employees don't update boards or nothing, very stressful job to work at with long hours"
good,"Uma empresa que é do setor de automotivo e por isso, esse setor é um pouco corrido no dia a dia, existe pressão porém a empresa atende as nossas principais necessidades como segurança, saúde e beneficios."
good,They take good care of their employees. They give extra time on breaks during the hotter weather and provide plenty of water to keep employees hydrated.
good,"The business was very well put together , the reason for leaving was not because of the atmosphere or job, it was because I wasn't on the intended job I was titled for."
good,les personnel étaient social simple sourient et geniel
good,"There was always overtime available, good benefits. The pay was decent for my qualifications. The work environment was comfortable, and easy to work in."
good,There wasn't a day that I woke up and didn't want to go to work there. The environment was always happy and positive including the supervisors when you seen them they would make a point to stop and communicate with their employees
good,"Empresa séria, produtos de qualidade e compromisso com seus clientes"
good,I was able to learn many new tools to prepare me better for Supply Chain Management work.  This was really my starting ground for materials management and how it all fit together.

good,"pick orders on forklift according to ordes, stacking mershandice on pallets for shipment to trucks.fast paced enviorment and steady work"
good,"I enjoyed with the NE Divisional Sales Manager, who taught me how to shadow him and take care of all administrative duties."
good,"The job is not too difficult or take a lot of effort to do, however, and this may be a plus for some people, but there is a lot of overtime. It is not optional and if you refuse you will eventually be let go for refusing. By a lot of overtime i mean at least 1 or 2 12 hour shifts a week if not every day depending on the time of year and where you work at. Also most weekends we worked at least Saturday if not Sunday as well. A streak of 22 days of work with no days off is far from an uncommon occurrence at this place. They give little to no notice of the overtime as well. You find out if you have to work a 12 hour shift the day of. They post weekend schedules only 1 or 2 days in advance, making it impossible to make plans, because you always have to assume you're going to have to work."
good,the job was fine work was easy nice people to work with I had no real problems working there very hot job in summer but you will get use to it  management is fair if there is a problem they will try to help
good,"Good in system and working culture to learn the process."
good,I work enough hours to have 2 full time jobs. I am not looking for all the hours like that. Some overtime is understandable but every weekend is to much.
good,a typical work day is very productive. I have learned how to make catlic converters and mufflers.  My co-workers have their own little click. I just stay to myself and do my job. I guess I would have to say the hardest part about my job is the heat and some awkward lifting on heavy parts that is suppose to take two people they make you do by yourself. The most enjoyable  part about my job is the line I am on I like it.
good,"Otimos treinamentos sobre os processos, trabalho em equipe, empresa organizada"
good,Tenneco give s lots of opportunity to learn and grow...it's depend on you...how quickly grab the learning's. Learn a lot about global process but due to un planned activity some time job is very hectic.
good,Demanding and exciting.Always new challenges to overcome.
good,Bra arbetskollegor varav den bästa delen var jobba självständigt på det såkallade minilagret.
good,"18 year tenure, 2 college degrees, 1 United States Patent - no complaints."
good,"Conferencia ordens de serviço, organização de trabalho, preenchimento de formularios de produção, limpeza e organização de setor."
good,"The job is easy and really does good with safety but the supervisors at time DO NOT know what they are doing. To have to stand by a bulletin board for 20 minutes while they decided where to put some people is not my idea of a well organized factory."
good,"Too much drama, unorganized facility.  Did not enjoy working there."
good,"Ritmo do setor em que eu trabalhavamos era sazonal. Por isso o começo de mês era bem corrido com muitas notas fiscais para lançar, organizar o estoque, o recebimento contínuo de material produtivo. No final do mês era mais tranquilo, começavamos a fazer os acertos do inventário do estoque."
good,Workday 07:00-4:00pm.Learned to setup pipe bender and automatic weld machine.
good,I hot glued multi sized boxes for Kodak products. wrote up reports for finished products. Utilized electric shrink wrap machines and used pallet jacks and electric hand band. I worked with hard working co-workers. management cared about their workers.
good,As a coop it was a great place to learn about rubber and polymers
good,eu aprendi muitas ferramentas importante do dia dia
good,"Corrido, pouca mão de obra, para a as demandas a serem entregues."
good,"A typical day of work for me is filling three engineering positions by myself. I am usually found on the production floor fixing equipment, finding missing tooling, acquiring parts that are needed for the operation of the machine, going to meetings, work on machines that are currently non-operational and making them run, looking through the various parchment paper drawings in the drawing room, and getting quotes plus putting in spending requests to get parts that are needed. I have learned to be self reliant, continue to work smarter and harder, always have the mentality of fixing one more thing than I fixed yesterday, and take pride in fixing equipment the right way the first time. The hardest part of my job is having a lot on my plate, and trying to get all of it done by day's end. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to use some of what I learned in college and making good parts within 0.001 mm of being perfect. I treat my job like working on a farm."
good,"Started as a temp on a fork lift and rose to a PTO3 level in 9 months. Job basically consisted of shipping and receiving plastic and styrofoam products and all the packaging that goes with it. Met some very good, hard working people there. Some of those friendships still endure."
good,Moral here was always medium to poor as far as management. Always talked about Quality but quantity was always the bottom line. Heavy turnover in management as far as Plant managers.that would make moral go down to people on the floor. One I started work there they cared about the people and worked with families but eroded. When family members of management started getting management jobs moral went down also.
good,"Good compensation, but a bit disfunctional.  Sometimes unwilling to change.  Management is a bit inexperienced and has a hard time dealing with associates."
good,I think it's a decent job with fairly good benefits. Hours ain't too bad they do try and work with you on certain situations depending on the situation.
good,"The hours were reasonable, pay was good, management turnover. Management and floor personnel have long tenures there with good historical knowledge. Surprised by layoff."
good,Enjoyed my past job and would like to return. Medical issue is now resolved. Tenneco was a fair place to work and did not have any issues with management. Hardest part was conflicting scheduling and working 21 to 40 days straight. Varied and very production centered.
good,Various departments use the SAP system but new hires are not given adequate instruction.  Need stronger internal controls and structure for new hires.

good,Buena empresa con características de alto impacto profesional para desarrollarse
good,I felt like I was not able to reach my full potential because of the lack of challenge and there was no room for advancement in the company.But I enjoyed the people I work with.
good,Throughout my time at Tenneco Automotive I have noticed several issues with the management. Supervisors tend to be lazy and not put in the effort to work out overtime schedules or notify employees of any changes. Layoffs are handled poorly and quite a few times I have not been notified of my return date until after said date has passed. The benefits and pay are fantastic. The logistical aspect needs much work.
good,"Learned to do various functions to keep things interesting,my coworkers were very helpful training for different positions I was put at"
good,Se trocar a gerência da empresa se tornará uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar

good,"plant support, contract work, good people, long hours, good manager,  typical automotive environment, had to deal with what was brought into plant, just no funding to continue on"
good,"This was a place were there were 12 hours shifts, but they had a great balancing schedule. every other weekend off. One could switch days off and have the opportunity to work overtime all the time. Great people and has good training."
good,if you like to stand in one place all day and act like a robot and do the same thing all day it was boring had good benefits and was slow but not a bad place to work
good,Good customer relationships and working environment.  Added convenience of large cafeteria.  Food service available daily for lunch.  Good prototype shop at facility.
good,"It's a factory that has a lot of different departments in it. It has long hours and the overtime is mandatory. The people are good people for the most part. Management will stand the best can they behind you, but it seems they have a high turnover rate.  Healthcare and benefits are good, and the pay is pretty good if you like to work a lot."
good,"Good place, pleasant people, but no home life at all.   Working at the  headset assembly line belt, we worked as a 5 person team to assemble small parts on the shock absorbers."
good,Tasks were strenuous. There are little opportunities for promotions or advancements. The work was steady only in few departments. Team leader were unqualified for the position. They did not know the workings of the equipment. Other employees had to show them how to manage it.

Worked well with others and willing to lend a hand when needed. The hardest part of the job was working swing shifts and the best of job was the benefits."
good,E uma excelente  empresa e voltaria a trabalhar com esta empresa
good,"Hard to grow yourself working here, not enough training or practice opportunity, nor any rotation chances. Working the same staff day-in and day-out is boring, and so many talented co-workers left after been with the company for 2-3 years. Also, the reorganization was pretty bad, a lot of people's direct supervisor in Europe, and it's hard to proof one's contribution. "
good,This company does not exist anymore except for the packaging company. They had a pension plan which was nice. Work load is dependent on which department you worked for.
good,"Place had poor ventilation, had problems keeping parts on hand, which left people working overtime. Put to much work on machines and failed to properly maintain them, leaving unnecessary downtime. Can not maintain upper management, had 3 different people in less than a year. All in all company has a lot of improvements that need to be made"
good,"At the first of the shift you always have to meet with your coworkers in your dept and do a regime of stretches and listen to a daily safety lesson. Then you go to your assigned area and do your paperwork, if any, and get your ppe, which is sleeves and gloves and run your first piece, inspect it and sign off on it then start to run your operation on the line. We get one 15 min break in the morning and 30 min lunch and, if you are scheduled overtime then you get a break every 2 hours."
good,"Petite équipe. Diversité dans les tâches."
good,Tenneco is a well-organized company with fair management and co-workers that trains you well. You learn new things every day.

good,"Możliwość awansu , bardzo doby socjal,różnorodność"
good,i loved being there but after reporting harassment to management which refused to do anything about it ultimately led to me losing my position there. I absolutely loved the company and the job that i did but was cut short of being able to continue there. i recommend if you have any issues with anything you take it directly to corporate and not to the local HR office.

good,"trabalho fácil."
good,"Everyday is the same, I've learned many things especially operating welding robots. The management is well organised and they are always there to make sure everything is up to the required standard. I have great co workers who are able to assist one another. The hardest part is to keep with the pace to meet the required production target. I enjoy welding."
good,Plant changed business model more tractor/diesel exhaust systems from gas automotive exhaust systems.. Resigned and moved on from employment with them.
good,Get to your station start on time can work O/T if avalible are shown new products that have to be done Easy to work with some of managment co-workers are there to help is needed The hardest is managment and they don't follow their own rules. Maintance think they have no rules to follow and managment does not listen to what the employee has to say. The most enjoyable part is clocking out no noise or sparks
good,This was just a summer job to get by at the time. But it was an great experience i learned a lot about mufflers and he process that they go through to be made and distributed
good,Tenneco has worked with me in advancement and has kept me aware of how I am doing as an employee.  The work is challenging but not overwhelming

good,Awesome learning about the TPS concepts form Toyota and my co-workers are well supportive to each other.Am slightly disappointed with the management hierarchy.
good,"Any opportunity to work on a job and gain valuable on hand work experience is a blessing. I learned communication skills,team work,a positive attitude, and various problem solving skills in addition to learning required job task."
good,Brass always gives workers a haRd time. As for work there is plenty of it. Long hours turn into a long week. The electrical work is not difficult only a lot of it. You can spend the entire day on one machine or answer 20 calls in an 8 hour period without any breaks. Life of a maintence man.
good,"The company failed to repair ventilation systems after failing air sensor tests for hex chrome for double the OSHA standards. Lack of management skills allowed for several orders to not be processed until AFTER they were due to be shipped, resulting in extreme hours (12 hr days/ 7days a week).  The HR team quit together causing lapses in benefits and an inaccurate point system."
good,"lavoro molto bello e stimolante, ma poco gratificato economicamente"
good,"Some times I would show up and be sent home 2 hours later cuz they didn’t have any parts for us to run for the rest of the day but if they needed help you could go get hours on other lines "

good,Travail très intéressant et varié. Être très polyvalent. Dommage que le CDI n'est pas au rendez vous.
good,"Work is pretty repetitive. No AC, so it is very challenging in the summer. Lots of cut backs and challenges with manning. Insurance has very high deductible."
good,to me it's like they cared more about the parts then someones health and family life. there was a lot of favoritism. management needed a lot of improvement.
good,"certain employees are the favorites, management needs a lot of help, changing schedules on a day to day basis, a lot of hours so its hard to spend time with your family"
good,I would recommend working here. The jobs range from very easy to 20lbs +. It gets very hot in the summer time. PPE sleeves and gloves are required. Management is pretty good about finding you an area that is a good job for you. There is a rate for every line but you don't get in trouble if you do not reach it as long as there is a reason. The machines break down regularly. They regularly run out of material or misplace it. They used to have a lot of over time but are trying to cut back.
good,"The company overall is great, management and the H.R department is great. The culture segregated. Co workers was very jealous"
good,"A fine company that is heavily engaged in their market and working with keeping their customers on the cutting edge of clean air technology."

good,Good place to work. You do have more days off than what it used to be when I first started. I left to start my own business. Thanks to Tenneco for the opportunity.
good,"I liked my job, sometime the hours were long. I learned something new everyday to help with the parts flow. Management had too many  relatives, husband, wives, girlfriends and boyfriends working in the same departments. Got along fine with most coworkers. The hardest part of the job was trying to get a straight answer from Management and taking the fault for their decisions. I enjoyed seeing coworkers everyday knowing we were going to try to make it a GOOD DAY no matter what."
good,"Typical day will include project updates, laboratory testing and report writing, factory plant problem troubleshooting, consulting with purchasing and engineering personal, & specification writing world wide and more.. Coworkers are helpful and committed to results. Hardest part of the job is establishing what direction the company is taking within  N. America though this is changing somewhat. I like sharing with young engineers and coop-interns what I have  learned after several decades in my field."
good,"I learnd alot their on the jobs i did.Most times things were fast paced"

good,I loved working for this company for 19 years. My job was relocated so now I am on the look for a new job. I still believe this is a great company to work for.
good,I really enjoyed working at Tenneco. It has been my favorite place to work. My role was to help the production plants with certain quality systems and I really enjoyed that. The down side was that I didn't really know anybody on site.

good,Tenneco was a good employer however the growth opportunities were limited.  I feel the changes being made and the forward thinking approach will serve them well.

good,"This is a very fast pace company, it is demanding with overtime, driving forklift to receive material for production lines and take away material when they are finished."
good,its a great to work for i just wish the employers would be more understand of the situations some employees go through but other than that its a great place to work
good,"Exerci atividade de operação de robôs, bom aprendizado!"
good,This is very productive place. But they expect too much from their employees and never give them time off unless you have vacation. Work you until you have no choice but to take a day off.
good,Entrar en un nuevo ambiente laborar es raro y ala vez divertido ya que conocerás nuevas amistades y aprenderás siempre algo nuevo
good,Enjoyed all I learned while working here. It was a great experience and I learned a lot about corrugation packaging.  The only problem was that I had a new born and they were not very understanding of that.
good,Fun and lively work environment that challenged me on a daily basis.  Enjoyed learning from older and more experienced co-workers. Was able to grow as a professional and engineer.
good,"Good working culture, small teams makes collaborative efforts, global engineering support is good, no boundaries on data access and study,"

good,"I really enjoyed my time with Tenneco, it is a very fast paced work environment. There are many opportunities to advance and most anyone is willing to help you learn.My manager was very good at coaching me to be a very successful leader. I gained as well as gave a lot of respect from/to the employees that I supervised. If you are willing to work seven days a week in a fast paced environment that is hot/cold at times then this is the company for you."
good,"I ran various machines, so each day could be different."
good,This job had some good and bad. the site and management has a lot of potential. The only downfall is ever since management changed the process of upholding efficiency in work area also leadership has declined.
good,"The work environment and job itself were both great. The pay was way above average for the area, but the place will own you. It was not uncommon to work every single day of the month."
good,Tenneco Automotive could be a great company to work for. They are very elementary in area's of Lean Manufacturing which could help improve their throughput and profitability.
good,"The work was not easy and it was rather physically demanding.  I was responsible for repackaging shocks and struts to ready them for delivery, and unpacking and prepping delivered goods for storage in the Distribution Center. The co-workers were enjoyable and the management was great. Overall it is a good place to work but it can be physically tiresome."
good,"Tenneco was a good company to work for, with descent benefits. Wanting something closer to home."
good,"Facil adaptación a los puestos de trabajo y tareas, gracias al buen ambiente y compañeros de la fabrica"
good,"Responsible for Technical Data of Mountain Bike Area and Commercial Assistant (10/2005 - 02/2008)"
good,Tenneco is a world class provider of automotive exhaust and ride control provider. The company has strong morel values with a focus on continouous imrovement starting from the CEO down. Increase drive in cost reduction and increase in productivity seem to fuel each plant individually.
good,my job was pulling orders so i worked at my own pace and management was great unfortunately i was laid off due to lack of available work
good,It was good place to work and to learn and become a better industrial maintenance tech. Great people to work with. The only problem I had is the way management treated it's employees

good,"Ótima empresa a se trabalhar,  o que mata é a liderança despreparada que estraga a empresa."
good,"You are able to skate by if you are in a low functional group, but if you are in a high functional group then hang on tight. If you prove you are a hard worker then the management staff will just keep pilling things onto you until you are overwhelmed."
good,Overall a good place to work besides poor management and lack of communication. Some areas can be very physical without proper safety equipment. The lack of knowledge from Supervisers is an issue.
good,Tenneco is a changing culture due to the length they have been in the local area.  They are doing a fine job trying to change the culture from a company that is growing.
good,Enjoy the people of Tenneco but development of employees is not evenly distributed.opportunities to advance are not clearly outlined. But the pay was excellent.
good,"great place to work with lots of friendly people"
good,Fast paced  with lots of goals and objectives.Learned if you were not in  the click you better start looking for another opportunity.There was a lot of turn over in production workforce and quality to customer was poor.The hardest part of the job was getting funds to properly keep the plant operating smoothly.working with honest hard working employees.
good,Tenneco is a great company to work for and the pay is good. There is ample room for growth in almost all departments. The worst thing I experienced working at Tenneco is the amount of hours you will have to work. Overtime is mandatory every week.
good,Company has been changing out senior management for two years drastically changing culture.  New announcement of acquisition with Federal Mogul and decision to split into two new companies further increases the ambiguity of careers at Tenneco.
good,"No tengo queja, quiza si hubiera posibilidad regresaria a trabajar ahi, me gusta por el tiempo extra"
good,"Good management team. New plant ramp-up was very aggressive and challenging.  A lot of hard-working folks, family atmosphere during the time I worked there.  Help from corporate team and sister plants was much appreciated."
good,The hardest part about my job was the constant pace. There's not good camaraderie. It's great that it's all indoors and have heat and AC. Plus there is always work

good,"o	Ensure the customer line coverage with assurance of Material availability."
good,"It's not a bad place to work.  There are a lot of hours; many 7 day weeks, working month's straight at a time.  Management isn't the best at communication.  Things seem to change day by day."
good,"Lots of challenges, with a high level of exigence that allow me to learn of multicustomer enviroment (125 different customers), many Management changes that requires constant changes and adapting to new ideas,"
good,"I loved Mondays, mostly because the day flies by in a flesh. Once i got my Mondays right, then the rest of the week will be easy for me. I never sound boring, I never give a description of my typical day as typical."
good,"A day at Tenneco can be 8-12 hours long. We usually are required to work Saturdays and often Sundays. The work is not difficult, but the extensive overtime wears on the employees."

good,Daily upkeep of machinery and tools.  Worked well with co-workers.
good,"8 hour day with one twenty minute break. sized notched, and spot welded clamp onto pipe for the line to attach to muffler. All managers have different opions on how things should be done, you make all suggestions work together.  Everyone works differently  but if you work well with others you can get a good system going which helps keeping anyone happy and making the night go faster and smoother."

good,"Pay is great and the benifits aswell. Have to work a lot of hours and they are bad about replacing people who quit or are fired. They are always looking to cut different positions to make production seem better and save money, which makes everyday a bit stressful but it’s steady work and great pay"

good,"Responsáveis pela alocação dos recursos em da fábrica, eu era ão praticamente o dono dos recursos. Mas a planta onde se faz uso de programação de fábrica ou de recursos, deve-se respeitar estes profissionais e suas competências e a programação deve ser seguida a risca. Assim, toda a sequência nos levará ao resultado esperado."
