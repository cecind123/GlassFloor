bad,"If someone leaves they stick you with their job and say they will rehire but it never happens.  Get hired for one job, and when I left I was wearing 4 hats, terrible place to work."
bad,Harris FT employee ( female ) worked as a regular Harris employee as a Recruiter who was extremely disruptive to others who were trying to do their work. This same worker had the audacity to repeatedly complain about her own workload but couldn't connect the dots that her own abundant socializing was contributing to her not being able to get her work done. 3 workers complained about her and asked to move away from her. Harris Sr Management never took control over the situation. All 3 who complained left Harris due to same. The place is also filthy with carpeting needing replacent and walls needing repainting
bad,"The work was good,but the management was horrible. Sometimes your job worksite won't be approved after driving 2hours to get there. Sometimes your check dont clear or it bounces."
bad,"It is a slow-paced office job. There is no excitement or culture at  Harris. Misplaced management that does not understand the jobs which they oversee. The secretary at the front desk is consistently monitoring who comes in and out, asking where you're going/where you've been and will report it to higher-ups. Rigid policies on PTO, not flexible whatsoever with working from home."
bad,Typical days at work are very stressful and full of being micromanaged. I learned a lot but because of not getting much help. Management needs to be redone. The culture at work suffered a lot because of this. The hardest part of the job was being told one thing and then being yelled at by another manager for doing just that. My favorite part was being able to learn so much and use so many different technologies.
good,"Dr Harris is a nice doctor to work for. We have a small team that run the office but things get done . Patient show up whatever time they want and expect you to see them and if the doctor is in a good mood, which is almost always, he will see them."
good,"Overall the company is a good company, their field staff is excellent and great to work with. "
good,"Everyday is a challenge."
good,"Same pro's and con's as your average defense contractor.  They need more diversity in their leadership, would probably do them some good.  Other than that, solid company, decent benefits."
good,"No advancement, would like a change to hands on. Management should be hands on with the software and more appreciated of employees so they know it. What I like best working for Harris is my co worker"
good,"Created Spool drawings"
good,"It is a good job everybody like family...I would go back.....good money nice job..long hours love all the people ,,,,fun times good vibes...good bosss"
good,"My job is hard work and overnight hours it does not allow me to have good work life balance.I'm grocery manager so I work every weekend and have little time for myself because when I get home I'm very tired everyday, that why I'm looking for another job with day time hours and some weekends off."
good,"good company, poor training! I was placed in another dept., on another shift where the work was non existent for 2 months +.the training at that time was little at best, and the person doing the training seemed uninterested in doing so.mostly on the phone, leaving for other parts of the factory, or collecting money for lunch.Another Tech arrived, and received the bulk of the training...."
good,"It was a great company to work for. My manager was awesome, she did her well. The people were nice and very helpful if you needed anything.  Typical day at work consisted of processing invoice and helping with entering payroll. The management seemed nice of the ones I got to meet.  The workplace was nice they were doing some remodeling. The company is a large company."
good,"Started out my day restocking the fridge with pop, then I would look for orders to pull for customers. If there were any returns during the day, I would write down what tools came back, turn in the paper(s) that I had written on to my boss and he would work on the rest. While working on returning items, I would put the tools back in their respective locations so that we would be able to find them again when needed. If there was an order to do some maintenance around the offices, I would assist in helping get that taken care of."
good,The team I worked with was extremely smart and intuitive of the contract that I was on. They were patient and helpful with assisting anyone that was in need of anything.
good,"Great company.  They have many sales tools and resources to help you be successful. "
good,Good place only it was contract.Boss was fair.Friendly culture. Soldering under microscope.Hardest part  was leaving.Most enjoyable part of the job was the people.Typical  day was working on pc boards
good,Great team of people to work with but the service was overpriced and what we were offering was difficult to quantify without ascertaining some specific information.  Tons and tons of leg work to build a proposal and our pricing was not competitive to the local market.
good,"Fantastic support structure with co-workers and peers, but management has problems working with modern technology and ensuring the success if their employees."
good,"Over saw field services and also Programs. Started as a Base network manager on NMCI and worked my way up to a Program Manager. Worker in DoD, civil and DHs"
good,"Overall the company was great to work for. As in every company there are up's and down's, disagreements, and complaints but I had a great experience working for them for the most part."
good,I have been with Harris for over 10 years and expect/hope to retire from this company.  They have always treated me more than fair and have been thoughtful of family and outside work life.  I started in administrative type work and been working with some of the same people my whole time here.   I have been treated with dignity and respect.  I have been offered extra training to help grow in my position.  Management and HR have always been there when needed.
good,working at Mr. Harris was a fun and exciting place to work. i learned a lot of new things working in the bailbonds business. It made me want to go into the business as well and being able to help families who couldn't receive help.
good,"Little to no communication between departments, some individuals are power happy but once you get past that there are many great individuals that work here."
good,I was a contractor and due to a hiring freeze in 2016 I found another job.  I enjoyed my supervisor and coworkers and I always felt a part of the team.
good,Part time working from 7pm to 7Am Saturday-Sunday  I was on disability at the time  my work hours was great I was also in school to finish my degree. Great hours to work.
good,"It's an easy company to get into.  You need to give them 110% work satisfaction.  Be on time for your shift.  Don't be on your phone all the time because management will take note and write you up.  Be respectful to others, and just go there for work."
good,"Harris is a great business to work for! Good reliable men and women employees. Great at getting straight to business and getting the job done. Loved the environment, the job, and the people."
good,"Actively looking for software testing profile having 4 years of experience."
good,"Very well organized work atmosphere, with room to advance your career per applying for opportunities that are posted internally  as well as externally. Would suggest to others with the right credentials to apply for posted positions"
good,"Great company to work for, really takes care of employees. If someone was looking to get into the field of HVAC, I would highly recommend Harris. Harris is a solid career move."
