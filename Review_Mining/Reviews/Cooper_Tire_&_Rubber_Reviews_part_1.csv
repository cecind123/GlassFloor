bad,Poor management that does not care about family at all. They will set you up to give them a reason to fire you and they will not hesitate to do so. Worked here for over 5.5 years and they decided I wasn’t what they wanted for an employee so they set me up and fired me
bad,This job is union. Laziness and poor management are like diseases at this job. They make the job sound better than it is. They work you like a dog and charge you money if you make mistakes.
bad,"I work in shipping and the job used to be good.  We're contracted labor and are greatly taken advantage of the pay continues to decrease while the demands increase when we lack the manpower to do the work currently demanded by us from an uncaring management.  Loaders have no benefits, no paid holidays, no sick days, no vacation days, no raises or career advancement, we also don't get paid downtime there are days I've been there 10+ hours only to be paid for 6 because our work has been set to pay by trucks loaded but when the system is down or the loads are going slow because we are short on assemblers we're left to stand around not working on the clock and not be paid.  Myself and a few others work 7 days a week loading 2-3 trailers a day.  We were told that we were to have a work to employee ratio of 7 assemblers to 4 loaders with the expectation of loading a truck every 3 hours instead we are understaffed on assemblers while management adds 5, 6, 7 loads on an already understaffed crew.  Everyone is tired and the morale of the workplace is continually dropping.  Forklift operators and transferring out of the warehouse to the plant because of the stressful work environment and temps are not being given the option of being hired in full time because management is more interested in keeping lower paid employees.  If corporate management looked into it they'd see that the temps have a higher pull percentage than full time cooper employees who are making more and getting bonuses.  There is too much of a buddy system in the office among management, foreman, and some copper employees"
bad,"Screw cooper tire and there raggedy a tires, raggedy a supervisors, and raggedy a place. Do not go work here. Unfair management and practices. Junkyard"
bad,"I was a teenager when I started working for Cooper Tire. Being young and having fewer bills than others, I was not given many job opportunities. We would load semi-trailers will tires, and you would be paid for the weight."
bad,"Direct management was inept, poorly trained, and unresponsive with no idea of how to improve.  Upper management is only focused on the bottom line, and fail to understand the workers are their number one asset."
bad,"There is no consistency and so much downtime that there is no chance to make money.  constantly down on material and having equipment problems. poor working conditions, long hours and cut in pay.  There is no reason to stay and a lot of people are leaving because of this."
bad,Sorted tires all day in a hot building. They smoke in the building as if its a outside job better management could be tooken place there. People walk out same day they get hired I seen about six people get hired the same day and four walk out.
bad,Nothing good to say about this company. 
bad,I would not recommend this company to no one.I have work for several company this the most unorganized company i have ever worked for they do not honor there commitment to there machine operators
bad,"Cooper Tire is nothing like what it used to be. The pay starts very low and takes very long to gain the wage that others are being paid that do the same job. It is also extremely hot in summer months. Ambulances were a common site, due to people getting sick from dehydration."
bad,It was a wrong choice to join them in the first place. The culture is so laid back and the people don't even have relevant experience and education for the work they are doing.
bad,This has been the most unorganized  and managed places I have ever worked. There is no accountability and management plays to favorites instead of most qualified.
bad,"not the best place to work at all. short breaks short lunches "
bad,"Company leadership is 100% ""Good ol Boy"" club.  Diversity and Inclusion is non-existent. If you are a monority of any kind do not put yourself through the hassle and unequal treatment environment and culture there.  Work systems and methodologies are at least 20 years behind the time. They say SAP but the system is garbage as the company did not invest in Reporting the SAP system is bare bones and majority of work is still through manual spreadsheets. No work life balance. Rules for some and guidelines for othera mentality. Very much an age and race based corporation that has no intention of changing and making their work environment more diverse. Amazed to see this culture still exist in 2014."
bad,"Everybody is fighting and trying to cover their butt."
bad,"Lacking honest communication "
bad,"Disappointed in working here.  I applied because they advertise a high wage and tell you that you will make over $20 an hour here but that is false and a trick to get you in the door. If production is fully running you might be able to make a decent wage here but they have so many problems with equipment down time and sales are very low with the company that it affects how much production is ran.  I left a good paying job that was steady and consistent pay to come here. Pay is all over the place, work is not steady, don't count on the making the pay they tell you that you will, management is poorly trained."
bad,"Once being an IT contractor at this company I realize that the management and IT structure is as old and outdated as the company. NO vision for future. Mid level management just follow instruction from top management and try to save their own work. People are rude and do not work as they are supposed to work. some of them are with the company for more than 10-20 years I wonder how they can work in such environment or they hardly works. People take advantage over others. No social life or development for county, the town Findlay is also hardly developed despite being such companies. I would not recommend this company to anyone for work."
bad,"A bunch of racial profiling is going on at this company. Could be a good place to work,but the older worker is a mess. Can't use the restroom when you get ready, it forces you to use it where you at."
bad,Absolutely the worst place I have ever worked.management is a joke.unless you are a pickup..pay use to be great..now can make the same or more with out swing shift..
bad,"Job Work/Life Balance - We were repeatedly required to travel on short notice to remote plants sometimes for weeks on end.  Worst I had to do was 9 weeks in a 12-week period.  I had to actually TELL my manager to get someone else to travel because I was burned out."
bad,Never start your career at Cooper as you will loose years of advancement in your professional field. I learned nothing other than avoiding bad politics and leave the company as soon as possible with better opportunities outside.
bad,"I had poor training on the equipment. On several occasions, I was told to run machines that I had no previous training on. I was out for 2 days with my wife in the hospital. I called my supervisor daily and also morning star. When I came back, I was wrongfully terminated. I supplied with all doctors papers and all request they had, they still refused to look into my wrongful termination, even after supervisor stated I had called."
bad,"The position for electrician at Texarkana, Arkansas plant has been unfilled for over 2 years. Do not waste your time going through the application process. A little background first, I have worked on this site for the last 5 years as an electrical contractor, I have seen several pool electrician retire or quit due to work enviroment. A typical day for the maintenance electricians is very relaxed, as the bigger jobs are contracted out.  "
bad,"The culture varies greatly from division to division. The  company is currently going through a difficult time, due to low sales, and that of course detracts greatly from any positives."
bad,"Difficult work schedule when raising a child as a single parent. The pay is excellent but the swing shift is taxing on not only the body,but the soul."
bad,Make less than non union companies and vacation days have to be taken during company shutdown.The benefits are not great and you have to pay a $2900.00 deductible before you can use them for a family plan.
bad,"CooperTires and Rubber is clearly the buddy system and they don’t hide it. Management needs to be investigated to expose their unfair treatment of employees. Most of the management need to be gotten rid of and new management need to be brought in to the Tupelo, MS plant. It is clear that all set rules don’t apply to all employees."
bad,You was being watched by the supervisor he wanted you to come in on your off days but get angry when you dont come in it was to much forklift wasnt no good they leaks really bad
bad,"I left a secure job to come to cooper, being wooed by management of the awesome culture, benefits, compensation, etc. What a facade!! The benefits and compensation were the only good thing about that place. Management is totally oblivious of what's really going on. All they care about is results. Employees are not valued."
bad,"The people there where rude,Workers are underpaid for what the initial pay was suppose to be,superviser wasn't a great team leader.Just not paying enough."
bad,The management that was there when I left had poor communication skills.  Plant was not headed in a good direction.  Human Resources was poor at helping employees advance or do the right thing.
bad,"Most unsafe place I have ever seen, and management just look away.. they need to replace some of the managers who actually care about safety. If they did that then it wouldn’t be a bad place to work."
bad,I would not recommend Cooper Tire to anyone because you work 12 hour swing shift one week you work 48 hours the next week you work 36 they have mandatory overtime but will have shutdown days at the same time you have to use your vacation days if you want to get paid because they had some shutdown days
bad,Cooper Tires is all about quantity and has no respect or concern for safety or team work with fellow co workers. The hardest part of the job is constantly listenig to disrespectful comments to my fellow co workers. The best part is I currently work outside independently moving trailers to and from shipping and receiving.
bad,"I was hired in off the street and they started me as a ""hauler"" this means taking truck tires off a conveyor and putting them on your shoulder, then putting them into a poorly made rack."
bad,Unorganized lack of communication rude and a racist place of employment. Stay away management sucks and mistreats employees. Everything about this place is terrible
bad,I liked the weekly pay checks most but the job was unsafe yet simple. I have had equipment malfunction many times and people do not work safely. I learned to work with my safety as priority because no one else will.
bad,"It’s a good place to move on from after gaining experience, but move quickly!   Leadership lacks vision and experience in a competitive industry.  The company struggles to remain profitable, focusing mostly on the short term.   Seasoned employees flee quickly as turnover is high.   There is little sense of job security."
bad,"It a job."
bad,"This was simply a summer job between sophomore and junior years of college.  Although not the best experience in the world, it paid pretty well compared to other summer jobs that I had been offered."
bad,"One of the worst organizations and cultures that I have ever been associated with. Instead of a traditional organization matrix or one that is structured as ""flat"", Cooper/Mickey Thompson Tires is very middle management heavy. Everyone has a ""Manager"" title, but only few have the know-how to accomplish a task or deserve the ""title"". "
bad,"My daily routine was to operate a machine for 12 hrs. The work was fast paced and repetitive. Hours were long and family time was hard to come by. Management was horrible, you're just a number. Seniority was non existent unless it was for vacation scheduling. All the really good day shift jobs were given to hunting or fishing buddies. Employees weren't informed of shutdown days until the last moment. Insurance was too high. No stock options anymore. No raises for years. It's really sad how Cooper changed for the worst after being such a great company to work for. I enjoyed the first half of the 25 years I spent there but after that it spiraled downhill. It seemed that with every new CEO and Plant Mgr, conditions only worsened. All take and NO give. Corporate greed at its best. Glad to be gone from this company."
bad,Worked through a temp service. Management was easy to get along with but very inconsistent. Got paid half of what was normally paid by Cooper Tire. No benefits.
bad,"In training, the trainer performed the task a couple of times and then put me on the machine. Not once did the trainer or supervisor come to check on me or the product I was running."
bad,Left hand doesn't know what the Right is doing. Poorly managed and when problems from this arise it is the employees that take the fall. Constantly set up for failure!
bad,poor management is main reason for leaving. they do have bonuses which is nice. I have a difficult time when I'm not challenged on my job. not challenging enough for myself.
bad,"Worked there 30 years , it was a struggle the whole time with management. Working swing shifts you miss a lot of family time you can never get back, think about it! You better have a degree to go up the ranks , they don’t value job experience or common sense. You can have so many degrees you can’t list them and have no people skills and dumb as a rock and they will promote youyou."
bad,Typical day at work is listening to co workers complain and not do much work. Boss is cool and relaxed. Hours were good but no raise or possibility of advancement. Liked the 30 minute lunch break but most abused it as goes the 15 minute breaks.
bad,patience at training you. Accept workings from all background and religious views points. accommodates any worker if necessary. the pay is not all that great
bad,Unless you want to go to rehab for drug abuse DO NOT WORK HERE. It is a dead end job and it is so hard to get a good paying job there that doesnt make you have to have surgery within the first 3 years of working there. upper managers do not care about you at all and the company doesnt give a dang about you either.
bad,Cooper Tire is a decent place to work if you don't mind an honest days work for an honest days pay. There is no change coming and people do not like change. The production thinks its all about them when if the equipment doesn't run then you cant make any money.
bad,"Things were great until they built plants in China, which they always promised not to do. The pay was high before and now its lower. I do not recommend Cooper tire."
bad,i didnt enjoy it just long days and long nights alot of getting dirty and alot of sweating great people and flexabe time schedule if needed nice down to earth people
bad,The company has international opportunities and has recently consistently provided bonuses.  Typically provides advancement opportunities.
bad,The work environment is friendly and family oriented.  The difficult part of the company is the moving of shifts without warning due to seniority bids.
bad,"As an employee for Cooper Tires and Rubber Clarksdale, it is obvious that the plant manager and subsequently nearly all those that work directly under this incompetent are unable to preform their duties professionally. the command climate is full of spite, guile and juvenile vendetta. Every issue is used as an opportunity to pass blame to someone else. Every issue a chance to get on the bosses good side by throwing someone else under the bus. The work was not the issue. The management was the problem."
bad,"Not a pleasant place to work, safety was not a prime concern and management is unconcerned about worker satisfaction. it's a real ""good ole boy"" type of culture."
bad,"Absolutely no training on the floor.  Weak Union. Union dues are more than the health insurance. "
bad,"Good job for general labor...not so good for the skilled trades. Management is dysfunctional."
bad,Managers spend more than half of their days in meetings - they don't know their employees.  Moving up within the company means knowing the right people.
bad,"supervisors could have shown more thanks to the employees, the pay could have been better, an i worked for I.H, they got paid less and even have pay taken out for lunch breaks as the coopertire employee didnt"
bad,Very hard work lifting tires all night. The hours are 12 hour shifts with 2 on 3 off 3 on 2 off. No bennifits no insurance no encenitive and no 401 k.
bad,"I am not sure if other tire companies pay their workers what they are worth, but I know for a fact this one does not.  The workers are over worked and underpaid."
bad,I did not enjoy working here at all. We worked 12 hours with shory breaks and we were kept in side the building from the time we clocked in until the time we clocked out.
bad,"loaded and unloaded tires from truck."
bad,fast paced and pressure from everywhere. the chemicals in the making of a tire can be caustic and dangerous. it was always hot and dirty.
good,"It was a cool place to work in the beginning. Until you see how they operate from the inside of the building. There is no reward or recognition for your good work ethic, safe work habits, excellent attendance, etc. The Union are not helpful, mgmt breaks rules and change rules as they go forward. Advancement is nearly impossible unless your family has history here. A Discriminatory action."
good,They didn't pay me my whole amount that I was supposed to be paid every two weeks management pro ih people they are a bad company all in all if some wants to work for them they better be ready to be messed around
good,The company is struggling financially and that is impacting the work environment.  Recent outsourcing and layoffs have taken a toll on the morale of those still with the company.
good,"it is not a career job and does not pay enough. we do not lock in we come in to the office the manager hands us a paper with either a load or unload truck to do, and we have to finish it in a quick timely matte."
good,You were expecting to have in your orders and your workflow must be fast pace and consistent.  Cooper tire management is barely horrible and will treat you poorly. The temp agency is the best way to go if you thought at working for Cooper
good,Entry level forklift position became. Available after one year of tug operator certification.. it was imperative to my certificate today.. s thank cooper tire even with the non benefit fast paced environment.. I'm thankful
good,"it use to be a great place to work but now you are off more that you work and not compensated for it , enjoy my coworkers but don't like being off and then having to work mandatory overtime"
good,"Good People, and the work was okay. It was the defected Forklifts they give you to work with. They break down every chanch it gets. I learnd how to operate the lift,but management didn't do any thing to solve the problem. That was the hardest part of my job. The best thing about it was i knew most of the people there."
good,Cooper was a great place to work until the current management team gained control. The general feel is employees should feel lucky they have a job.
good,"Overall ok place to learn but has a lot of peer prefference. Needs more comunication amongst peers and better way to problem solve. Needs improvement In organizing and customer service attention. Overall, still a good opportunity to learn computer and customer service skills to grow and advance in future areas."
good,No se valora el desempeño personal y no hay muchas posibilidades de crecimiento.
good,Spotting trailers in and out of doors. Then would check outgoing tires to be loaded. Would use RF Scanners to process inbound loads. Was offered a Team Lead position. learning the process of closing out inbound paperwork. Picking tires for outbound load depending on size of tires. Putting away the incoming tires once skidded.
good,Competetive but doesnt care about employees. If you miss a day for family they hold it against you even if you never miss a day. They hire so many people who end up leaving after 2 days.
good,"Cooper Tire could have been an amazing company to work for, but there were basically 2 large companies in that town and they were rarely hiring.  So, for those with advanced degrees, you had to take what you could get.  The working environment was stressful, my direct manager was an imbecile and I suffered many health problems as a direct result of the toxic environment.  Layoffs were always looming, much overtime without pay.  My job turned into something that was very rewarding despite all of those negatives."
good,"Cooper Tire is a fast paced stressfull work area. Long hours, short breaks and a lot of loading and unloading tires. the managers are easey going and hard at the same time."
good,"Had to meet production standards everyday as normal. Only thing about the job is the no smoking on the premises. If caught smoking its a immediate termination, no 1st 2nd or 3rd warnings."
good,"I typically came in early every day to find out what I would be doing. "
good,"It is a past paced job and has very good pay for this area. The problem I have mainly is the declining benefits and loss of 401K matching. The long term view in my opinion is in 20 years how much money out of my retirement will I lose due to the company match and the compounding interest it would draw. We have a pension right now but I am not betting on that."
good,"Union has some good points, but even if you are great employee the chances of promotions are minimal due to all the employees ahead of you. No matter if they are a good employee or a very, very sorry employee they still have seniority."
good,it is based on the buddy system.as far as getting to advance in the company.the most enjoyable part of working here was the coworkers.making rate everyday was the hardest thing to do on a daily basis.
good,Fun and fast paced tire shop that takes care of its customers on a daily bases for all tire needs and most mechanic problems that may happen. From small cars to semi trucks and trailers. We even take care of most tractor or combine tires.
good,"Hired for assistant manager. "
good,"The compensation and benefits were okay, but the company seems to hire kids out of high school to manage more experienced employees. It takes too long to be transferred to day shift."
good,"a typical day was fun, dirty and good workout"
good,"The management was terrible. The supervisor were pushing the workers hard and had production sped up too, fast."
good,"I have had this job for almost 3 months, and it is really fast-paced and stressful. People there sometimes are not positive. I was so tired sorting tires for 12 hours, but I am not used to work at PM. It is a good job for people who don't mind working between AM and PM."
good,Cooper was good to me! Not a a bad place to work. I wouldn't recommend working there if you have kids. And the pay has changed for new employees since I left.
good,"Business is often slow which leads to the reduction of hours. Typical workday consisted of various vehicle maintenance issues including oil changes, tires, fuel pumps, power steering pumps, etc.  Very honest owner when it comes to dealing with customers."
good,"I real enjoyed working at cooper tire and would one day like to be employed there again.  The hours were good,i got experience working with things such as pallet jacks ,and operating a fork lift and was able to meet people from all over,the hardest part of my job was dealing with the heat,and the best part was a lot of times i could make my own hours ."
good,Great place to learn classes were very well taught. They teach things that can help you advance in life and in the work field. They can also help you move on to another job.
good,12 hour days 6 days a week. no time to enjoy family. fast pace environment where you could not afford to get hurt yet no continuous improvement programs.
good,"I like what I do, I like providing services to our clients.                           Cooper is going through a lot of changes within the IT Department."
good,"Co workers were instrumental in learning the tire building process while management made sure your job was as difficult as possible."
good,"una empresa donde tu opinión no cuenta,no esta abierta a escuchar ideas nuevas ni opiniones personales."
good,"this place is hot but its a decent job, you cant trust management ot HR"
good,It was ok to work if you didn't mind working hard and sometimes getting home a little late but other than that it was a great job. That you most definitely feel after work the next day.
good,"This job was very difficult because of the graveyard position and hours i had. I didn't get to spend time with my family, ever. But it paid well and i worked very hard. But my wife and i relocated and decided it was time to find something new."
good,I enjoy working  there. They are gradually cutting out our incentive bonuses and keep shutting the plant down. Averaging 34 hrs a week. I need a full time check not a part time check.
good,"Good starting job. Good coop program and on-boarding for new workers. Tends to have a lot of turnover in the technical and research areas. Many upper level managers are locals and this can have an impact on how outsiders are treated. "
good,loading or unloading trailers all day or night was physically grueling. its a young mans job . i did it from age 38 to 40 and that was enough
good,operating reach-lift daily in a fast pace environment. great people to work with daily. I like to be challenged and am a very fast learner.
good,"I worked in a support function at a manufacturing plant, and I can tell you Cooper is a good company. However, I got paid muck more for doing the same job elsewhere. In addition, there weren’t many advancement opportunities. Overall ok, but there are better jobs out there if you are really good at what you do."
good,"poor management "
good,"The job is ok . The job should pay more because of the weight of the tires.  Also management could be better.  I think with the right training the work would be easier as far the RF scanner, Overall its ok."
good,Productive and fun place to work. Hot hothothothothothothothothothottogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogo
good,"In my time at Cooper Tire, I had an enjoyable experience. People there collaborated well and were friendly. However in talking with many of them, it became apparent regarding how advancement with the company went. promotions to management positions are not common, and many times managers will be in the same position for decades. as a result many engineers stay within the same job or department for decades. Overall it is a good place to work, but do not expect much advancement past engineering roles."
good,it sucked i have my life i can  pay bills im never gonna a raise they are cuting hours right now and its slow management is meh if your on there good side its okay but if not you hate it the hardest part of is wake up at 4am
good,The mentor you're assigned will make or break your experience at Cooper. It was hard to get along with my mentor due to personality differences but they had a ping pong table to help break the ice.
good,It was a good place to had alot of good people and alot of work to keep us working till the hob closed doors on business around 8 years ago I believe.
good,Never be tire sorter. Worst job to have.  It's stressful they talk to you any kind of way.  I feel like you should get more pay for the work because sometimes you triple working yourself because of others.
good,Fast paced working is very competitive and you have to be set in on making fast decisions without flaw. If u can handle that then you can handle Cooper tires.
good,"Long days in a very dirty work conditions, pay was not equal to the amount of work performed. Very fast paced, not musch room to move up the company ladder"
good,it is very hard work and it takes it toil on ones body. if you are not in good shape do not work here. pay could be better very all the hard work that you have to do.
good,"Good co-workers and local managers, but high level management is always cutting jobs and making decisions based solely on dollars and not listening to veteran workers.  Have had significant cuts to workers in last few years."
good,Cooper Tire had four US plants before 2007 when they closed a plant in South GA.  The plant was a great place to work and employed a large percent of the population of the mid sized town.
good,"Cooper is a good company to work for, if you are not very ambitious or having a clear career path. Management cares more about what you doing but less on what you can do now or in future. It's very conservative and hard to make any change."
good,The work place culture is very laid back and friendly.  It is a great place to start a career for someone just starting out.  Very competitive environment that strives for success.
good,"Old factory, but can be enjoyable with the right group of guys. Personally didn't want to leave this job, however, I ended up not having a choice due to the fact that I was hired on as ""student support"" and could only work up to a year until my position expired."
good,"gained new insight in the field of production, as well as training new exployees. Troubleshooting machines, and scrapping rubber from tires. Also stacked treds on metal shelves per two man team."
good,a typical day working for this company was challenging but very benificial to becoming a skilled forklift operator and dedicated employee.
good,This is a very physical job. Being in shape is a must for this job. It was isolated work.
good,Average company to work with.Job security is minimum .Projects are less to work on. Growth is minimum.
good,this is a very tough job and it smells very bad all the time. the job has  very good pay i made $17.00 hour its just not worth it the work is to hard for the pay
good,Took tires off aline than put tiris on the properl rack. all shifts are swing shift. all shifts are 12 hour shifts
good,"I liked this job, the people were nice.. Hands on wasnt the best, not alot of training. Small caterings but it paid the bills.."
good,"Overall I like working here at Cooper. They will take a chance on talent with little to no experience and offer many opportunities for advancement. Most coworkers are friendly and there is ample opportunity to get involved in different groups and the community."
good,The job was good until sales slowed.  We were then being laid off and made less money when we did get to work.  Those with more than 3 years of service received comp pay.  Those with more than 10 years of service were paid more money for the same jobs.
good,Like job. Good working environment but poor management like bring able to learn different positions.  Fast past but still good. Enjoy the work force..
good,The Job was a good place to work.  The job was unorganized to be honest. They messed up people hours & money. I wouldn’t recommend nobody to work at cooper.
good,"this was a fair job.... I work there back in 2008-2010. very busy, and sometimes hard work but overall good job... hot and very oily.................."
good,it was all about how many tires u could build for me and 100 percent wasnt good enough they wanted 150 percent even when they supplied you bad material.
good,"A typical day started with forklift checklist, transporting tires to loading dock and receiving shipments. I learned the warehouse and tires shipping process which was interesting."
good,"The co-worker are very easy to get along with. great production team, good medical benefits. Bad management and bad union"
good,"I worked at Cooper Tire for fifteen years and did just about every step of the tire building process. what can I say? it was a factory job, hot,sweaty,dirty. It kept my family fed,clothed and sheltered."
good,"If you don't like your job, bid on another one. Dirty, hot, and you won't work days on a premium job for about 10 years. But you do get a boot voucher. And some jobs will pay you for a paid lunch. But with it being a union job, and the union offering the new hires 15% percent of their pay to the company, it makes it quite an unfair working enviornment"
good,"12 hour work day, expected you to build 30+ tires for the whole shift which left you no time for breaks or lunch"
good,"The operations of IT have moved to a central location; therefore, IT opportunities are minimal. The enviornment holds many engineers and manual technical labor. I was an intern here and was a great place to begin my career."
good,"Very busy, Fast-Paced company. You have to stay on your toes at all times and do your very best not to get behind. Being a team player is a must. Management should promote those who show work and care and should also let there employees do their job. But overall, good place for employment."
good,I enjoyed working at Cooper Tires for three years. It gave me a great knowledge of warehouse and factory work. While working at Cooper Tires it taught me great time management skills. The hardest part of the job was having to run several macj=hines at the same time and making required goal of production.
good,Working there was a getting and helpful opportunity. It thought my responsibility and leadership. I grew because of that job.
good,"Good pay, steady work, work every other weekend.  Work your off days for overtime.  Production, production, production.  Pay every Friday, work has.much has you want, but always need you on your.off weekend."
good,I work swing shift.  12 hour days driving a fork lift.  The management is good and it has a good work environment.
good,"Cooper Tire was a good place to work with great benefits and good wages 30 years ago. Gradually, corporate has chipped away at both and now struggles to keep employees. Turnover rate among new hires is high. New hires should expect to work back shifts for many years. Depending on the job, it can range from easy to difficult."
good,i make it to work around 6;30 find a pattet jack... find a 18 wheeler to work in.once your tires make it to you it your responsabilty to load anywhere from 32 to43 thousand pounds on it
good,"Twelve hour shifts with two ten minute breaks and a thirty minute lunch break. Switches back and forth between night and day shift every two weeks. Good management, alright co-workers."
good,Great place to work if you don’t mind being inside of a factory for 12 hours at a time. Amazin benefits with great people surrounding you at all times.
good,There is a lot of favoritism shown at this company. Employees who have been grandfathered pretty much run the plant. Seniority rules regardless of experience/education.
good,"A typical day at this job consisted of loading tires. At this job I learned how they load tires into semi trailers. The management was pretty laid back. I really didnt have much time to talk with my co-workers because we never ran out of tires to load. The hardest part of the job was when you had to load a truck full of the smaller tires, because it was harder to get the trailer to the right wieght. The most enjoyable part of this job was when my 12 hours was over and it was time to go home."
good,the people who work there are easy going great team but suffer from lack of good management health and safety is important to the company. wages are good
good,Nice people over there. Every IT Person there is on a contract. The contract is indefinite and you can be there however long you want but just know you will never be a coopertire employee
good,Very organised in the offices. Very unorganized on the shop floor.
good,the job was ok as long as todd the manager was gone. it was enjoyable at night. it was hard at first but it changed over time. I had fun with my supervisor at night
good,"Working for Cooper Tire provided well for my family, Cooper Tire required you to be physically fit, self motivated, and reliable."
good,"You have to be very productive and work hard at your job because we have lots of competition with selling our products such as, yokahoma tires just to name one so we do our best to give the best products"
good,"Mucha carga de trabajo "
good,"I enjoy my job and working with my co-workers, I drive a forklift and pull order to be loaded on trucks. I work a swing shift which is the hardest part of this job. The job I have is outsourced through a temporary agency and will not be considered as a permanent position with Coopr Tire."
good,"I started working for Cooper in Bowling Green OH as a finisher at the age of 18.  Fresh out of high school, I was hired in as a finishing operator and then moved to the extrusion lines.  I was working with people there that had 30+ years experience and was doing the same job.  I wanted to move up in the company and moved to Mt. Sterling KY where a new plant was being built.  The atmosphere in Bowling Green was laid back and didn't seem like there was a lot of pressure put on the work force."
good,It is a good place to work if you like factory work. I enjoyed the people I work with. It was a fun place to work for me. The thing I hate the most was the heat in the summer and fall of the year. The management was not very good. The enjoyable part of it was staying busy.
good,"I was able to experience a new workplace while at Cooper Tires. I was grateful for the opportunity to be able to provide for my family. It was hard work and challenging, but I adapted well to what was asked of me."
good,Cooper Tire was a great place to work it had a very hard working workforce. The employees were dedicated and only wanted the best for themselves and the company.
good,It was a good work evironmen. Got along with everyone in the workplace. Was on time every day. Stayed on top of the job at all times. They showed employee appreciation during the years I was there.
good,Was only there for a short while. Swing shifts. Will not refer to anyone but if you need a job than there you go. Rotate hours from week to week. Not a hard job.
good,The job itself is alright. But there's poor management that makes it a miserable place to work at and the pay isn't enough for the jobs that they require people to do.
good,"hot, heavy work.  Good pay, weekly pay.  Dirt everywhere  and you have to shower after work there just so you don't destroy your own tub at home.  Not very good training."
good,"Due to being part time I usually never did the same thing. I would clean, paint, or even operate machinery. I enjoyed my co-workers because most of them knew my family and I got to hear stories. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,"We use to have a company picnic and be more family oriented like a real team company."
good,Overall an enjoyable job and a great learning experience. With this job I learned how to use Pro-Engineer and verification software.
good,Cooper is a place I would recomend retiring from. the management team is easy to work with and has been a great place to work. I am looking for a new challenge.
good,"Stay busy - never a dull moment, never a down moment.  People are always in and out of the office whether changing addresses or taxes, or wanting to talk to one of the managers.  "
good,"worked main gate, met a lot of people. worked 12 hour shifts, only on weekends. 10 a.m. to 10 p.m."
good,"I learned new skills was a good place to work. I got along well with my co-workers and management,"
good,"They are a great place to work prepare to work very hard and stay hydrated in the summer"
good,Very fast paced place to work the more you put out the better you got paid. Everyone is very helpful great group of guys to work with  there.Work a 2-2-3 schedule
good,My job was interesting and constantly changing which made it fun and motivating. I performed many tasks for several managers and supervisors. Cooper offered continuing education and training that pertained to my job.
good,The hardest part about the job was working long hours with hard labor. Most enjoyable part about the job was being off on every holiday & getting paid weekly.
good,"Just looking for more in life I don't get overjoyed with happiness thinking about going to work , but i believe it's just the Texarkana Plant not the company itself."
good,"trabajo continuo, con muy poco descanso, pero el trabajo gratificante"
good,"It was about the same thing everyday. I learned how to Operated Forklift. Management was strick, and my co workers was fun. The hartest thing was it was real hot. Best thing the on friday they would cook."
good,Not a bad place to work. Pay is very good but the hours could be long with no time off for weekends. Temp to hire takes too long to become a Nissin Brake employee.
good,Work culture and people there are great. The Findlay location would be the place to be if you had to choose one location. Strong sense/place in the community.
good,"Having worked at this Company for 30 years it is fair to say that there has been a marked change over the years."
good,I wish this company never went over seas. They treated employee well i would advise anyone work there
good,"Operated forklift stacked pallets of tires 4 high in certain locations in warehouse.  Also, staging loads of tires at the dock doors. Lunches and breaks were not long enough for the 12 hours shift."
good,This Company has a strong workplace culture. They focus big on work-life balance. Giving you flexibility in your schedule. The benefits provided here are good.
good,"The bead room doesn't pay enough for the amount of scrap you end up with and the broken down machinery you have to deal with. Bonus in the bead room is slim to none, you are lucky if you even make rate regularly."
good,Compensation through 2016 was very good but the business became more challenged with lower sales and more competition.
good,I was hire to design equipment for the tire industry. I was responsible for design overseeing building and installation and startup. This is where I truly found my calling and passion for what makes things work and how could I improve them.
good,"Limited resources and funding make it hard to accomplish the needed work.  Co-workers friendly, but stressed from backlog.  Project management restricts acchomplishment."
good,"El plan estratégico de la corporación es incrementar los volúmenes de producción, por lo tanto siempre estamos involucrados en proyectos de instalación y modificación de maquinaria con la finalidad de hacerla más productiva, también estamos involucrados en proyectos de mejora continua de procesos."
good,Cooper use to be job security but lately its not calling off its employees on a weekly basis
good,"I was a loader and unloader when i first got on with the company but i loaded by hand until the manager saw that i was a hard working man that would actually work and gave me a position to run the forklift so then on i loaded the trucks with the squeeze lift and regular forklift and that job showed me so much concerning production, i am so glad to have had that experience."
good,"Let's face it, manufacturing is hardly a safe bet in any field, but the tire industry is particularly volatile. I am not mad at Cooper for shutting down my plant. The pay was fair, but the benefits did decline over time. Again, par for the course in manufacturing... and this is a political issue moreso than management."
good,"Overall, my experiences working for Cooper Tire were good. There was always a variety of work so that you were not doing the same tasks continually. The people that I worked for were professional, but also caring. Management had dificulty in making a decision and proceeding with completing the projects."
good,"I was a Beads Operator for 4 years. Assisted in a production team of about 10 co-workers in the department. I loaded drums onto the Beads Processing Machine, and loaded the machines up to run filler onto the beads as required by production standards. I was a First-StageTirebuilder for 7 years and operated a First-StageTirebuilder machine to run liners on drums, and to run 1 ply and 2 ply onto the drums, and ran treads onto 1 and 2 ply to build a carcass, and i also had to operate a control panel box. I also was a Tire Sorter for 2 years as to where i sorted tires out with the same treads onto a skids, i labeled all the tires according to their name brand and manually stacked 25-30 tires on a skid daily."
good,Findlay is a small town - with a few large employers like Cooper.  You will have great coworkers here- and find it very hard to leave once you know them
good,I got paid 13 an hour to pretty much do more work than people who was getting paid 20 something an hour there. Honestly it's a gud job to work at I just feel like all of the hard work temp people do should get paid a little more
good,"En general es una buena empresa q otorga muy buenos salarios, el ambiente de trabajo muchas veces deja mucho q desear porque muchos de sus empleados no hacen ni lo mínimo por el trabajo"
good,I normally go in to work find my supervisor. I get my schedule for the day setup my machine check for quality an produce 400-600 tires a day. I learned all I could in 5years it was good but no promotion
good,Worked here for about 18 years. Made a lot of great friends. They have good benefits. I decided to finally leave after several people I know died with in a year the year from lung cancer.
good,Cooper was a very laid back atmosphere but when things needed to get done everyone was able to buckle down and get the job done. The hours were good and overtime was available.
good,"Good Management. Great opportunities for advancement. Very nice benefits."
good,Very enjoyable place to work. Everyone within the company is friendly and the management are approachable. Always opportunities to gain more skills
good,"you get out what you put in, at the local level.  If you are willing to work hard, your efforts are recognized and advancement opportunities will present themselves."
good,Working for this company is physically and mentally demanding and time consuming when living over an hour away. I work 12 hour shifts driving the forklift and stacking tires. Every two weeks I change from day shift to night shift. The hardest part about this job is having to stay up during night shifts and getting my body used to sleeping through the day and being up all night. I think the most enjoyable part is knowing that I am able to provide for my family. While working for this company I learned how to adapt to different circumstances.
good,Most days at Cooper are fine. We have bad material some days that makes it difficult to run the machine. I have learned a lot about machines and trouble shooting. Most of my co-workers are good friends including management. The swing shift we work is the hardest  part of the job.The most enjoyable thing about the job is pride in building a good tire with great people and the pay is good too.
good,"Good work, great pay, fair benefits. Hated it, when they shutdown the plant"
good,you went to wok did your job . co-workers were like family. the old bosses were great they new how to treat the men.
good,A typical day at work was screwing doors and locks.I learned from this job to put the doors in slots and assemble them together so they won't fall apar My manager and coworkers were very friendly and nice to work for and with.
good,"For many, this is a job that you can retire from. Personally the shift and rotating schedule dont work well with my outside responsibilities. You can make good money if you are willing to work hard."
good,Cooper tire is a good place to work but in the last 5 years the moral has went down . The management is not as good as it use to be they don't care about the employees like they should
good,"Cooper Tire and Rubber is a good place to work to make an honest living.  I have had the opportunity to advance some, as I started out working on the plant floor.  I have been given opportunities to learn more about company processes the more time I have been employed at this company."
good,management supports growth and personal development. I enjoy working there because of its diversity and the different set of skills that engineers at Cooper have
good,"Copper tire has excellent workers that work to high standards, job performed at cooper was fast pace and precise. Logging all measurement according to standard work instructions."
good,Good Company - enjoyed working there.  Liked the group that I worked with and enjoyed meeting the students for the Co-Op Program and talking with the schools that offered Co-ops.
good,Plant support with a good Boss never reported to the contact company only reported to Cooper. The only neg about the position is it is a dirty smelly place to work
good,"Cooper is a good place to work but, getting 60 hours 1 week and 24 hours the next week ain't working out for me. Also I only get 70% of what I being paid."
good,Highly physical. Leave feeling like you didn't 12 hours in a gym. Filthy factory but that's to be expected. Unsteady work hours. Good pay/benefits. Employee concerns are unheard.
good,Management needs improvement Benefits are nice. Coworkers are your family. Moral could use some touches but itll get better over time and with the right upper management.
good,paid good and a steady work flow. I learned a lot about the machines and tires. The work place was a good environment to work in. The hardest part was the rotating shifts
good,"Great environment, good people, and minimal stress. Many opportunities for advancing knowledge and skills. There are pros and cons within any company. Pros outweigh the cons."
good,"good place to work,clean environment, friendly willing to train their employees. Room for advancement. Overtime available to those who were willing to work."
good,checked machine  and  rubbers in correct order extruded rubber for sidewall installed proper dies for spec did several quality checks per run
good,"Overhauling test sheets, developing test protocol according to ISO, driving vehicles, mounting tires, scrapping tires, client tours and presentations, precision driver training and growing subjective feedback experience and reinforcing those concepts in order to understand objective tire feedback. "
good,"has been good but all the drama of getting bought out by Apollo Tire of India. I just want to know if I am going to have a job from one day to the next."
good,"One day at work I was helping a customer that had a fork in their tire. It was a pain to get it out but I did so, I liked the job because I could help out customers that needed the help."
good,"Cooper Tire is a good place to work, it can be very demanding work, but you are compensated for your work. The only bad thing about this job is their have been shutdowns and hours cut due to the economy."
good,Very warm inside. Alot of layoffs. People bumped you to different shifts alot
good,very fast very hard long hours but very very good pay 2500$ a week
good,A typical work day was a 7 hour shift. Loading and unloading shipments. The management was friendly and understanding. The co-worker were welcoming. the hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks in the summertime! the most enjoyable was the pay check.
good,I really have nothing bad to say about the company except the plant closed and in these days and times that is not unusual.
good,Work is to slow need a new job if my job had more work I would stay but as it is now I need more work and more money ..I work at a high speed and being that work is to slow I am missing alot of money on my weekly check I need a better job..
good,Be ready to work no slackers. Must be able to multitask and work with other departments to find solutions to better product. Must work well with others.
good,"This place is very busy. There move a lot of tires, but it is a place that require to be willing to change or adjust on a dime. So you have to keep your mind in the right place."
good,Good job. Piece rate paying jobs throughout the plant. Management there was very helpful in whatever you may need help with or to demonstrate how to get something done in a more timely manner.
good,"Many people there have been there for 30 years. I enjoyed working there, I had a great boss, but it was time for a change. It was a great place to start my career, but there wasn't much room to move up without moving departments."
good,"Task were defined and obtainable and employees were rewarded with incentives to exceed production requirements"
good,"Worked in Mold shop in Texarkana Ar. Great Group of guys to work with. Long hrs and hot but great benefits. Retired enjoyed working there. Bosses were good the Union was every helpfull. Only problem a lot of lazy employees, play on cell all day."
good,It is closed down now. gonna miss that place. This job consist of the same routine. get up go to work pull your tickets and have to do your quota for the day.
good,i became union steward at cooper tire and liked it but sometimes i learned you can make alot of enemies that way also. I enjoyed working there and wish sometimes i wouldn't have left.
good,Did the task at hand. Learned team work. The management was ok. Workplace culture was ok. hardest part of the job was the heat. the most enjoyable part was getting the job done.
good,"Excellent pay, job benefits, 401k, healthcare, dental and vision. Overall great place to work. I would still be working there planning to retire there if the plant had not closed."
good,Fast paced production environment. Dependent on the availability of raw rubber and machinery. Driven by product demand in the International Tire Market.
good,the job was very fast paced but easy to handle. the people were good but the pay could have been better for the people who were staffed at the plant. i
good,Cooper Tires was located in an ideal location for me.  The commute was less than 15 minutes one way.  The job was production oriented with 12 hour rotating shifts.  It was an fast paced operation which made things stressful at times.  The company gave you the option to work overtime if you wanted it.  Management was hands-on with employees and assisted with all types of problems in a timely manner.
good,Excellent. I really enjoyed my time with Cooper Tire and Rubber Company and am very thankful for all of the experience and knowledge gained as a result from working there.
good,Sometimes they have a lot of overtime. Then other days our hours are getting cut. 12 hour shifts. Great people to work with. Steady or fast paste positions
good,"They are a amercian tire company that specialize in design ,manufacture,marketing,and sales of autombile and truck tires,motorcycle and racing tires.(WORKPLACE CULTURE).Management,,CEO.cheif human resources officer,,SVP,CFO,seem to be really nice people often having company picnic at the parks and diffrent events during holidays.were employee,s could get to no each other,,outside of just yr work groups,people you saw everyday.workday was getting there 2nd shift and talking too first shift Q,C,,to see if there was any changes from day before during shift report starting too work,,,staying focused just like any other job.just you had to always stay intuned own everything going own and keeping safetly and quality first.there was not a hard part of job,sometimes demanding butb not hard.the enjoyable part to me is a finished product,that doesnt have too come back to my department job well done.all smiles."
good,By far the most fun an challenging job out the group. Learned a lot working there. That I use on other jobs.g good management all around. An like I said before. One of the most fun jobs I've had.
good,This was a relaxing work place that let you make your own pace at work. the boss was nice and very understanding and he always helped me when i had a problem
good,"Most of the guys I worked with were really fun and funny, easy to get along with and make friends with, joked around a lot. The supervisor was the same way."
good,"Every day was an open page, every situation presented was different, high level internal communication skills, solve from minimum to huge difficulties just for being on time in every shipment. Without the leadership of the Directors and the effort of all Cooper team success wouldn't have been possible."
good,I worked with cooper tire for 11 yrs where I held different job titles over my 11 yrs there
good,"I learned skills in management. I was responsible for assigning the shift members to their dock doors, and work type. Whether it was a load or an unload. After they had completed that specific door i would assign another door, and i would bill the truck so that it was able to leave the shipping yard."
good,"A great temporary agency to work with, placing me on multiple assignments in a timely manner .Allowing me to increase my skills and knowledge so it enable me to become more marketable in the job field"
good,I had good days. My Supervisors were fun and down to earth. My co-workers were easy to get along with. When the task were difficult there was always someone to enlighten me further.
good,"Great place to work, great people to work with. New challenges daily to make a better and safer product, while doing it safely."
good,Working closely with co-workers to run a productive line.  The job was hard but it was a good job and the worker worked together to get the job done.  Having to let the job go was one of the hardest things.  The company moved to Mexico.
good,It paid my bill and allowed me to live confortable for 6 years and it also helped me buy the things that i needed to take care of my two girls.
good,"Some departments are great where u dont get dirty, summers are hot winters are cold in certain departments. Excellent pay, 4 different shifts where management is kinda to harsh"
good,If you're willing to come to work and work then it's a good job to have. Good money depending on where you work. Great schedule. Alot of good people out here.
good,"Cooper Tires is a great place to work, full of interesting people with various backgrounds, always contribute to the success of the Finished Goods Store in Swindon, there is a balance of laughter and productivity. Great salary and all around positive place to work."
good,Cooper seemed to be outsourcing many of their IT positions when I decided to move to Columbus OH. I truly enjoyed my time working at Cooper but I did not feel like I had job security.
good,Cooper Tire has plenty of opportunity for growth and development. During plant shut downs you are paid for the time off which is well beyond what most plants/factories offer in this area. Every other weekend off with a 3-2-2 schedule. No rotating! You will either work the 6am-6pm or the 6pm-6am shift. Different areas of the plants offer different incentives in form of bonus' but all pay well.
good,I like the job u could get raise and u can advance in the company. Great compensation / benefits and management. Love working with my co- worker and great team work.
good,"I work at Cooper Tire for 25 Years, I have good and not so good experiences, but overall It kept my life going forward."
good,i really did like working with the people there and it allowed me to work alot of overtime which i liked the most.
good,"On the sort line we worked 12 hour days and sorted approx. 20,000 tires per shift. It was hard work in a plant that in the summer time would reach temps well over a hundred degrees. On the good side, we were given paid lunch breaks and several other paid breaks throughout the day."
good,Its a good place to work hardest part of the job Ill say had to been the condition. Its a good company to work for they are willing to work with hours and days to make it more willing to work for you.
good,Learned a lot a Cooper Tire and made alot of friends. Even see my old plant manager from time to time.  He still knows me. My wife and myself worked there.
good,"Workplace is fun and comfortable. Great people to work with. Productive workplace and always learning new traits. "
good,being a tire builder require to most defiantly follow rules
good,"I work a rotating shift, 12 hours per work day. I learned how to calibrate and maintain the tire building machinery. The management team were fair and understanding."
good,"Everyday held something new, whether you where working on different parts or facing new challenges. As a machinist, I have learned the many different aspects, such as running the machines, how to edit programs, and ensure quality for each part that comes out. Cooper Tire is a family oriented environment where management and co-workers can all get along as friends and peers. I felt the most satisfying part of the job was the ability to learn more areas in such a small plant, and that the company encourages advancement."
good,I've been here for 16 years and have had plenty of experience with ups and downs. I am ready for something that's more secure and has a future. I know management has a tough job and I appreciate all that has been done here for me. But it's time to move forward!
good,"It Was Tiring But other than that the job was okay.Never Had A Problem With Any of The employees or anything. It Was Good Paying also. Then They had it where like on my side of the "
good,"if you have the skills, you can move up and make a great living with this company.  Plenty of entry level positions and plenty of opportunities to grow with the company"
good,"Great job. Everyone is family there. Employers look out for each other. Great benefits.Teaches you life skills,  responsibilities. It's a job that you could retire from"
good,Very good working environment. You will learn a lot even if you work as an intern. Mentors and managers are very helpful. I would definitely recommend anybody to work there.
good,I love working for this company.  People had leadership skills and were people-oriented.  Everybody worked as a team.  They listened to employees ideas and  they offered feedback.
good,"good place to work,  just looking for something else because i dont like texarkana, and the union is junk.  pay and benefits are very good"
good,The management was really good. Love my job there. I operated the forklift and worked day shift. Only problem i had with them is that i was sick one day and couldnt come in and I contacted them so they knew. I came back the next day and they told me to go home.  They did this for about two weeks. When i went to talk to hr they told me that the supervisor had put me in as a no call no show.  So with that I ended up loosing my job.
good,"Nice place to work. easy job requirements. I only had two lines to work so I had to be face paced. My team was awesome, I felt like we were the best shift there at the time."
good,On a typical day my job was always running smooth.I learned to operate a Forklift and a Pallet Jack. Management in my department was not all that good. My co- workers were great pepole to work with.The hardest part of my job was dealing with the heat throughtout the summer.The most enjoyable part of my job was running more quality material than any other shift.
good,its a great place to work. The people are nice and they help build good working skills. I would suggest them to everybody who needs a good job or great tires
good,"I love my job at cooper tire. They do their best to take care of their employees, but they stumble sometimes as any employer does. They have great benefits, matching 401k, vacation after 3 years and most big holidays are paid."
good,Not a bad place to work but you have to be quick and you have to be willing to get dirty. its hot during the winter and hotter during the summer in curing anyway. the workers are generally friendly and willing to help if you need it.
good,"Was a job. Poor management.  They were trying  to point blame instead of fixn problens. Pay was good,wish they had better,morally better management.  Could be a great place to work"
good,"packed an unpacked trucks packed full with tires i learned how to stock tires and got a great work out in, had great co-workers and even better management the least enjoyable part of the day is waiting on the fork lift driver to pull your skids and give them to you."
good,a great leading tire company that builds quality tires and gives jobs to men and women
good,My time at Cooper Tire and Rubber was ladened with fast paced Industrial IT work. It was well communicated to me in a structured ticketing environment which produced great results and always productive pace.
good,Management was tuff to understand. Very fast pace not much room for error. Owner is very honest and a good person with strong family relations. Great place to work if you like hard work good pay and very fast pace. Company has a very very good customer following.
good,"I have been at Cooper Tire for fifteen years. They were fair employers giving you chance to train, develop new skills required within the company. I was fully trained in health and safety, Manual handling and Fire Marshal. Unfortunately I find myself being made redundant. Its been an enjoyable 15 years meeting new colleagues whilst getting the job done."
good,I worked 12 hour days and was offered unlimited over time  they are willing to let you advance as long as you stay committed and stay and put time in. Great group of people to work around and with.
good,"Cooper Tire was a well Managed plant, that excelled in excellence.  The atmosphere was upbeat and the management really cared about their employees. The pay and benefits were excellent."
good,I enjoyed working at Cooper I hated when they shut down. They treated the employee excellent and the pay was great.
good,Mostly fast paced and competitive with some positions requiring teamwork. Piece rate work on most production jobs. Great working environment. Breaks are set but lenient
good,"I learn a lot from team mate and leaders very positive environment, great company to work for, always feel been appreciated and my hard working never goes wasted , I wil recommended Cooper tire for any one than can work hard , willing to learn and make unlimited income !"
good,"This job was a great job to have in Findlay, Oh. I was part of the darker times a few years ago when they locked out their workers in place of scabs however, they got their stuff together and got back on track with the Union. If you do your job your good period and that pretty much goes for any position in any company but especially here. Some of the positions are piece rate so if your motivated then your paycheck will be too. Don't trust the higher chain people but you wouldn't see them anyways. The managers are stuck in between both but are great people and will really work with you as long as you don't abuse it."
good,"good company, good facilities good working environment,they are moving production to other countries so they are doing a reduction of the staff by 50% at Melkshan plant"
good,"enjoyed working with a lot of hard working guys. had a lot of laughs just trying to get through the day. we had a lot of pride in our craftsmanship building tires, the same tires our families used on their cars and trucks. old school management understood the hard work and the sweat , blood of the hard workers , and had some empathy for them. younger management doesn't understand that and only think about production , bonuses. hardest part of piece rate was to produce a lot of parts and still keep quality in them."
good,Everyone worked hard at each level of the company. CEO was very personable and approachable. Cooper worked at growing from local company to global competitor.
good,Both the employees and the customers that come in they are very respectful. Very good communication with the workplace. When the employees want something done they send the email asking and they're very patient about it
good,"Excellent atmosphere to work in.  Great and helpful workforce willing to lend a hand to get you up to speed and help you understand and do your job. "
good,This job consisted of loading tires into the warehouse for further shipments. Or unload them from them line and sit them up for shipments. Really good job can get all the hours you like.
good,My  father in law got me the job there as it was well-paid better paid than the job that I was doing only intended staying for few years  ended up staying there for 25 years  work my way up to supervisor
good,Was part of team that created new machining processes for new facility. Designed several special cutting tools specific to machining process. Was able to finish my college degree.
good,very good place to work. The pay was high with a lot of time off to enjoy with your family. The work was very hard many people got hurt trying to preform their jobs.
good,"Good team oriented atmosphere, people are easy to get along with, and friendly."
good,"I worked the night shift, had an amazing shift supervisor.  I didn't mind the night shift at all. Very laid back, come in do your job and leave. Zero stress. Work at your own pace. Company parties/dinners regularly.  However, newer management was not transparent with the direction of the lab which ultimately led me to look for other options.  Job security felt unpredictable and nepotism was increasing at an alarming rate.  Very difficult to advance career outside of the lab.  It is a black hole for anyone trying to move forward in the company.  If you are content with staying put then it is a really great place to work. No micromanaging which was so nice."
