rating,review
bad,P.... poor management/too many chiefs not enough Indians I think you can fill in the rest. During my 50 days of working with Boise driving through Forest City’s daily 100 miles Round-trip daily from work to home I occurred three traffic tickets which made me Late to work occasionally during my 90 day probationary. No one cared no one gave a care no one cared In fact I was fired by someone half my age that’s Boise for you
bad,This company has a very high turnover rate 90% alot employees constantly get hurt in this company management pushes the employees way too much with the overtime and management keeps overworking their employees to the point they quit to find another job management is so greedy about their bonuses they want all the employees to work really fast they dont care about their safety this company is getting worse and worse and they are having a hard time having people if management doesnt get volunteers to come in on Saturdays then its mandatory they dont pay their employees enough for the amount of work and stress they go through every day they're so cheap to do repairs which costs them more time and labor because they dont want to spend alot of money to get it fix the first time all their machines are very old ancient they need to upgrade and buy more efficient machines but they refuse to do it corporate needs to get rid of everyone in management and hire people that actually knows how to run a business because the current management team is driving this company straight to the ground this company is very understaffed cause how management treats their employees its ridiculous it's a hostile work environment and management is very disrespectful towards their employees
bad,"The main thing that prevents this company from being a great place to work is management, and lack of adequate training. I wouldn't recommend this company to any potential employee. The last thing you want to put up with as an employee is a management staff that doesn't respect you, especially working in extreme weather to get the job done."
bad,this job is not for everyone! its very hot and cold. when it rains the rain leaks on the inside and you get wet. a lot of wood to clean up which is very hard
bad,this job is only good for people with no children or preference in shift. you are notified in minutes before your shift ends that you have to work 12hrs. the environment is very hot during the warm seasons and very cold in the colder ones.
bad,"For the most part most of the people there are awesome to work around but, the management there are a bunch of back stabbers.I enjoyed working with the group of guys i was directly working with."
bad,Been operating a machine for more then a year and management still refuses to give me operator's pay I'm still getting paid General labor wages this place is a joke I wouldn't recommend working for this place to anyone management treats their employees very poorly and management wonders why their employees quit
bad,Lack of people skills.  Need to be focused on the people that work there to help make the mural better.  People are what makes the company a good place.  Upper management is very poor.  No real decision making.  Pay was lacking in the sense of not getting paid for the knowledge you bring to the table.  No compensation for going above and beyond.  The only good thing to say is the co-workers were great!  Co-workers genuinely care about each other in helping them to succeed.
bad,"Unprofessional COMPANY."
bad,Management there is in there own click does not care about employees you are easily expendable they constantly change work hours and schedules with no regard to employees family life or child care arrangements they do not deliver on promises or pay increase as stated when hired  they will tell you what you want to hear when hired but that quickly changes nothing they say ever happens it's usually the total opsite if you want a home/family life do not work there
bad,Worse job I've  ever had   yard manger don't  talk  to  people  with  respect  they tell u can advance  yourself  but that's  a dam  lie I know guy's  there  for 16-17 yr  and still doing  same thing  and same  pay that's  your people  nvr stay there  run  away  from  this place 👹
bad,its a okay job my hours are from 6 am to 3 pm. my day go by very slow sometime but its worth it i have currently taken the forklift training and test
bad,"Even though I was in a management position, upper management was a complete disaster.  Promise were made prior to accepting offer and they never followed through.  Life/work balance was non existent not only for middle management but hourly employees as well.  So, my advice for anyone that is considering working at the Moncure facility, don't.  Unless you like working in very, very below working environment with terrible management."
bad,"Very poor and un organized place to work very poor work place has no benefits, management is poor, would not recommend anybody work for them, dont appreciate anything that gets done"
bad,Don't do it. You will regret it. The supervisors are all back stabbers.  They have their own little clicks running around spying on you.  They let their little clicks get away with being lazy.  And the people that will work they will work to death!
bad,Did not enjoy my years at Boise. Management is terrible. It was a really bad iexperience. They treat employees unfairly. The only good thing was pay was decent and close to home .
bad,The Thorsby mill in Alabama has always been a good place to work until certain management staff were brought in and now it’s gone down hill. If your not willing to kiss butt to the management team then you don’t have a fair chance for better jobs within the company. We work 65 to 75 hours a week and that is mandatory. No family life but yet management does not care. Would not recommend working here and I will go out of my way to make sure all people in my area do not get treated as poorly as my coworkers and I have been.
bad,"Poor management and no clear vision.  New ideas are met with resistance and hesitation.  The manage,memnt eats by fear and intimidation and as a veteran no care for any disabilities"
bad,"everyone hates working there due to work/life balance. they split your days up off, insurance is too expensive. its next to impossible to get the job you want or bid for due to seniority."
bad,"management is horrible,they won't take care of you.you are just a number to them .pay is good, other then that they are poo."
bad,"Did not like at all, treated hourly an salary like trash."
bad,"This company and the folks who work here are terrible, they would rather see you fail than succeed. I was a 8 1/2 year employee and when I got hurt everyone flipped on me and showed there true colors they make you feel like if the plant blew up and you got out but no one else did you'd be like screw it..............."
bad,Non professional culture with expectations of long hours.
bad,"Hard work and that's it. Don't dare miss a day. Was laid off on my third week. Management lied to me, hot and sweaty work with co workers that would rather make fun of you than help you out. "
bad,"When I was hired and took a tour around the yard the supervisor of the yard warned me that there is a lot of jerks that work in the yard that I cannot be thin skinned, from day one I dealt with rude and unprofessional coworkers that did everything they could to make themselves look better and make me look worse, with 20 years prior lumber experience working for several different companies I think I know what I’m doing,  they could care less if you take breaks or lunches at the proper time, just a dog eat dog world in this place,Unless you work in the offices they have it much better than yard workers"
bad,"The majority of employees are family members, it’s the good ol’ boys club mentality. Employees harass, bully, talk to you like you’re a stray mangy animal, grab you by the arms and scream at you, poke you in your chest and scream at you. They take super long breaks so sometime you won’t get one. People play on their phones all day, sleep.  When you try to get help from HR, supervisors, or union officials you won’t get any, it’ll probably just make your work life harder and more demeaning, and lots more harassment to come."
bad,the typical work was not hard. but the people made the job uncomfortable. the pay raises were bias. there was no room for advancement. I was not treated kindly.
bad,"If you are young and willing to work for low pay, this is the job for you. The new manager cleared out the majority of the employees that worked for the former manager. You are constantly wondering who is going to stab you in the back next. Also be prepared to hold prayer meetings on the sales floor. Very uncomfortable. Don't bother having a personal life. Management does not care. This used to be a wonderful place to work. The new manager has turned it into an office of low paid, inexperienced workers with no direction."
bad,Dislike the policies and professionalism. Disrespectful environment but compensation is good. would recommend to work at Boise in Florien but have to very cautious of your surroundings.
bad,All management staff are back stabbers. They use floor employees as a source of info orto rat out each other. They want to control your life even on days off with several calls about things as a manger you should know.
bad,"A corporately sponsored, family run business, with back stabbing, and all the soap opera nonsense."
bad,"Typically the day to day wasnt hard I was very sore in the beginning,  pulling chain takes work to get good at and nobody gets it quickly. The people you work with ar e mostly good hardworking individuals. During the 8 week probation the company can fire you for anything they want. Management is terrible a few supervisors really want you to succeed but others on a day to day basis are head hunting. I personally witnessed one hiding outside in the dark watching workers just searching for something to fire you for. You will work from break to break but that makes the day go by faster. Safety is NOT top priority they preach saftey but when concerns are brought up management wont do a thing and belittle you. I did the most physical job at the plant im in very good shape hardworking and a veteran with 6 years in helicopter mechanics still no idea why I was told to walk. Maybe your experience will be different. I do not recommend this job."
bad,"E.M."
bad,The company hire you for one job but you are doing multiple ones but only get paid for one job. They cant keep nobody due to the lack of pay and the way they overwork each employee. The pay raise may occur annually no guarantee.
bad,Certain team leaders and supervisors make it hard to work there and the place is falling apart from only doing patch jobs instead of replacing parts in facility
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place for no-one to work at.  This job isn't for people with a family at home. I say that to say you spend more time there than at home
bad,"Poor management "
bad,A typical day was chaotic and stressful with very little organization. I learned no matter how much you put in to the company they do not give you the same in return. Management is very naive to the work going on around them and does not take employees seriously. Workplace culture is very hostile and fast paced which causes very high stress levels and an unsafe work environment. The hardest part of the job was working with and for people who had no idea what was going on in the work place. The most enjoyable part was actually getting to do my job and the variety of responsibilities i had while i was there.
bad,"No advancement they would rather get a drinking buddy in from outside. no shade on hot days, kept equipment up to date. best part of day was lunch"
bad,"You are just a number to the management out there, if you are late or don't kiss up to them they will write you up and or fire you.  You have almost NO chance of ever making more than 12.71/hr.  Some of the people I know out there have been there 20+ years and are still at that pay grade.  They will offer training but once you are hired you are where ever they put you for the duration of your stay.  They do not put money into repairing the machines, instead they dump it into management bonus's and making the place look somewhat nice.  If you need a paycheck while looking for a real job, Filler King/Boise Cascade will do that as long as you aren't late or absent your first 60 days, after that you have a slightly better chance of extended employment.  The handbook is changed multiple times a year to make it a worse environment for the employees, you won't get any vacation until after your first FULL calendar year of employment, so if you start in Dec, great, you only need to work 13 months for your first week, if you start in the middle of Jan, you need 23 1/2 months for your first week."
bad,I rather not give a review on Boise....All I can say is that management is very corrupted and will take down anyone they can to cover themselves...simple as that
bad,Poor management. Lazy staff. Hardest workers are treated like garbage while the laziest people were treated like gods. The politics and favoritism are ridiculous. Worst GM in the world. I would not recommend working for Boise Cascade. There is a reason they are always hiring at the Boise location.
bad,Its 12hr shifts no overtime anymore. And favoritism. Its good for certain people who are looking for a starter job. But not for a long term job. I do not advise others.
bad,Work wise good management horrible they let me go due to a injury that was caused from something other than work i re injured it and they said i will be ok for work they will hold my position had my doctors notes and everything and they let me go in a week
bad,"The work was easy at times and other times could get rough. The management could be improved. My coworkers were friendly and sociable. Even though the compensation was good, I don't think I would go back."
bad,Management talks down to the employees in upper management holds grudges.  Liked my immediate supervisor and the crew of guys that I worked with we were safe and we were efficient and when the time came to either fire somebody or make an example they made me the example.
bad,"Was told on a few different occasions a start date, but after being hired it took over two months to finally be able to start. I was given the run around by two different members of human resources."
bad,"Worked 12 to 13 hours with no lunch breaks or breaks of any kind. Do not recommend this job to anyone. They do not want the guard shack to be left, not even for bathroom breaks. Can not eat in the shack but not given no time to eat elsewhere."
bad,coworkers were great job is great money is good management is confused they make changes and put people in Wrong positions they dont take time to talk to each individual what can be better it will help a whole lot supervisors dont know whats going
bad,Was employed by Boise for almost 9 yrs...3 raises and no advancement. ..it's an ok company for someone out just out of high school to start working...
bad,"Management is very hands on, answers questions and is available to you. Starting pay is low at $17 an hour. Benefits start immediately.  Retirement plan 401 k."
bad,Excluding all of the unnecessary conflicts it is a nice place to work. Management could have stepped up for the employees and been more supportive to the conditions.
bad,I worked there for 3 and half years.  Got let go when i refused to work over 50 hours a week.  They want 60 or more.  Management doesn't care about you having any kind of life outside work meanwhile they work less then 8 hours a day 5 days a week.  Always shorthanded and very inefficient procedures thruout plant so always working from behind.
bad,"Good people, Dangerous and very dirty work environment, be prepared to work hard and long hours and terrible management and HR. Be prepared to work over when you've worked all day and ready to go home. Machinery needs to be updated"
bad,"I have noticed on these reviews that salaried employees have a very different perspective on Boise Cascade than production or maintenance employees. "
bad,"Poor Management"
bad,The typical work day is very dirty and management is very unappreciative. Material and tools are hard to come by. As an older millwright with years of experience in different line it’s very to go to work work and can’t wait to clock out. Bottom line nothing good to say about is company.
bad,"Underpaid and over worked. Management did not appreciate employees. Company was set up to take advantage of the workers on the floor. Little opportunity for advancement. Someone would buy the plant, make a profit and sell it. The plant constantly changes hands and it got worse every time."
bad,"Its a great place to work if you dont have a family or a life. It seems to be almost set up to where you have to work overtime to bring home a decent pay check. At my time of employment, I bonded with a few other employees and the job itself wasnt so bad, but the conditions were absolutely abysmal and the management was the worst i had ever been under. A lot of micromanagement, butt kissers, and two faced people"
bad,"10 hour shifts up to 5 days a week or more are worked and positions are seniority bid only. Getting into a better position is a waiting process with seniority bid positions only. Not much opportunities for advancement or shift preference. However, a lot of employees have stayed their up until 40 years of work there. That being said the seniority bid positions are the reason there is not much availability for advancement. External positions are available at some plants. However, at some plants the manger likes to give those positions without posting them for internal or external employees to safety committee members or people with no degrees and the work experience. Some opportunities for those in that fit that. Management and supervision could use some work on there human relations and interaction with workers. Work life balance is poor when you have a family or kids.They do pay better than average employers out there. They are very safety oriented and have luncheons and safety events."
bad,"very abusive managment, very unfair to hourly employees  "
bad,Hated it.  you do the exact same thing everyday for 12 hours and then switch from days to nights every two weeks.  Pay is horrible and after 5 years you only get a 50c pay raise a year
bad,walk in 15 min early everyday for a safety meeting. walked towards my station and stay there working for the whole 8 or 12 hours by yourself
bad,This location does not care about their employees health or wellbeing. The management only cares about covering their butts to make sure they have a job. I’ve been denied a Doctors medical excuse so I could have time to heal. I’ve been written up for getting in a car accident on the way to work that resulted with me being in the ER. Getting rear ended at a complete stop by another vehicle traveling 55mph apparently wasn’t a legitimate “excuse.”
bad,"The job is fine , the work environment is very poor, employees treated poorly and unprofessionally. Sure they buy lunch every once in a while but that doesn't make the unprofessional atmosphere and disrespect of employees go away."
bad,Okay  company to work for. Can't say to much as this a fairly new company to me meaning they haven't been long took over the previous company. But so far Okay.
bad,I worked 12hrs a day 7 days a week most of the time. People would not show up to relieve you from your shift. So you would have to cover. You would get a written up for calling in sick. Supervisors would wait last minute to tell you that you had to work over.
bad,"As you look into Boise Cascade on many sites and forums, there is a common tone. Bad management. If you are the type to lower your integrity, play favoritism, and live in a constant state of confusion, then by all means go work for Boise Cascade."
bad,typical day of work was pretty fair some times things would run smooth but for the most part it was very stressfull. I would get along great with my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was keeping the machine running provided that the whole team would work together.
bad,needs new management the they have is running plant in the ground and safety gets thrown out the window when it gets in the way of production long hours low pay supervisors work like a millwright and that's not your job
bad,"There are always challenges in the workplace. Whether it be old equipment, bad attitudes, or poisonous management. When your workplace has many of these afflictions, then the problems become deep-rooted and difficult to solve. This workplace had the worst gossip issues I've faced as an adult. Management was extremely uninvolved with solving personal matters, as well as creating plenty of their own. Personal, positive communication was almost non-existent."
bad,Not spending enough time with family and people steady looking over your shoulders to get you out the door
bad,It's good money but it's not for everybody and the communication is bad the breaks are to short but the days off are good to plan a vacation around it
bad,The job started out great hours were great and the paycheck helped.. after awhile it started going down hill and things were hard to get. Goals were made impossible and certain places didnt get enough help.
bad,"A typical day is a 12 hour shift. 2-20 minute breaks and one 30 minute break. You work 2 week days and 2 week nights."
bad,Its real hot in the summer & real cold in the winter. Management is ok but they don't tell you when you have stay overtime till bout time you get off. Hardest part is the hours & days you work 12days in a row 10 to 16 hours a day
bad,Not a bad place but geesh you have no life outside of work they expect you to work 6-7 days a week months at a time and expect you not to be tired the pay is great but to work to life balance is horrible. If you have a young child this will be a challenge for seeing as you may not see them grow
bad,Poor Job culture not do to the working people but do to the management talking the workers they ware going to less their jobs daily. The benefits ware good.
bad,"I worked at Boise Oakdale for over 17yrs. When I first started I had a competitive salary, pension, and a 401K match. Before I quit the union and company worker together to strip employees of all benefits with the exception of healthcare. Having said that, there are very limited employment opportunities in the area. So if you are not willing to move this maybe a viable option to scratch out a living:"
bad,"I Like the environment And its. A good place to work . i Like the fact that we work 12 hr shifts but i dont like the break periods , its a good place to start work ."
bad,"Office products is a dwindling business.  Cutting down of protected trees, accounting troubles, not so good management, upper management let go, nice to work close to home."
bad,"must work shift work. Grave yard, Rotate with split days off. Takes a long time to get enough seniority to bid on a day or swing job with weekends off. I spent 7 years on Rotate then Grave yard shift."
bad,"Has crazy hours, not a good place if you have a family that you want to spend time with, demand you to work 12hrs on most days. The relief shift suck, some weeks you could work up to 60hrs and 6 days a week every week. Don't care for you to have a life outside work."
good,Great pay great place to work only if you are on a good team with good team me who want to work and take their job seriously because some do not care about the quality of the work that they put out and that causes stress on the ones that does take they job seriously
good,"In my time at Boise Cascade a high management turnover rate created an inconsistent, highly stressful work environment.  The managers were mostly kind and competent but not always so.  This did irreparable damage to my career.  This company has a serious ethics problem that is not being actively addressed and is resulting in failures at all levels."
good,"fast paced ware house enviroment, great place to begin in management , management supportive ability to work independent and get results m-f no weekends"
good,It is a place to have means to provide for your family. Could have more family friendly workplace. Management could be better with communication when its needed to perform job task better.
good,"co-workers are nice, work is easy, pay is ok. work life balance is bad, no raises, a lot of down time, 12 hr shifts, stay tired"
good,"It's a good job that pays good money and good benefits. If your a family man or women then it is not that much of a good choice. Yes the money is good, but you are always working, your barely home, and the company is not very caring toward their coworkers. All this job is good for is money and benefits."
good,"Not a bad place to work if you want overtime and a steady pay check; benefits are outstanding. If you are career minded and want advancement, it is best to look somewhere else."
good,The job is ok if u like fast paced work. The team work is extremely unfavorable. The management doesn't take your concerns into account. And if one is a temporary employee the be prepared to be treated as if you don't actually matter.
good,"They have a great established hiring firing system. Where beginning of season hire and end of season fire."
good,Decent benefits and pay. Plenty of overtime available. Having to work off shifts makes it hard to have a life outside of work. They give plenty of opportunities to cross train on different jobs.
good,"never knew what you were going to do, management played favoritism among certain employee. had a great deal of training. on the most part co-workers where great to work with, hardest part was being told to do something by one supervisor and then being told by another he wanted to do it another way. the most enjoyable was getting to go home after 12 hours when you where scheduled for 8 hours."
good,"Most of the people working at this location are good people. Those working in the yard, warehouse, or shop are all salt of the earth people with the kind of foul mouth you'd expect/want, but there is a clear disconnect between the office and the labor force. Administration is tied by a corporate structure to meet demands. Those demands come at the expense of absurd hours and ridiculous workloads."
good,I got tired of poor management and never knowing what time I was going to get off... Was threatened for my job if I would not stay over if u want over time u can get it
good,Some supervisors care about the job and make sure things run smoothly others don't care. This causes an imbalance between the shifts witcb is terrible. Management talks to you any kind of way as if that's the only job in the world! The plant is not temp friendly ( poor insulation when it hot outside its extremely hot in there and when it's you have perform with frozen feet and fingers!!!
good,"The people on the floor are a joy to work with especially when working to solve problems."
good,"It was a fun place to work but hard to meet quota's ...Early morning,"
good,Learned about calculating load bearing.  Learned about engineered wood. Was not to excited about learning and using their software.  Was not utilizing Autocad.
good,Very hot and dirty place to work.- Good place to learn about the maintenance field.- Great group of people to work with.
good,"A very challenging stressful environment, with many safety issues. I would not consider it to be a positive work place. However, it pays well and the benefits are very good."
good,Long work days and little time off. Very dusty environment but normal for a plywood mill. Can make a competitive salary compared to other companies. Room for job advancement.
good,"The typical day was answering phones, mailing out about 100 to 200 mailings a day to other companies offering them are products. Answering phones for 6 people. ordering the supplies that they need for their department. I also helped pick and pack products to be shipped out that day to the companies that ordered the items."
good,They work a person TOO many hours. I liked the job and most of the people. Nothing really bad to say. Just no family/work balance. All about the work.
good,it was a good work place for a kid right out of high school. would have liked more overtime. i worked with some pretty rude co-workers who didnt show me anything
good,Work load Is a lot Not willing to increase pay even when work load tripled. Hot in the summer cold in the winter they do provide Jackets shirts gloves and steel toe boots. Big on safety.
good,"Answer inbound/outbound calls 20-40 a day"
good,Management was hard to get along with and they did not care about safety or the employee. pay was not worth the drama and hoops.
good,boise is heavily understaffed which causes you to work excessive hours every week. they provide water and cool down stations to keep cool in the summer. management is okay they do get stuff done but not with any haste they promise things to make work easier but never follow through and constantly change people start times making it hard to have any kind of life outside of work.
good,"working environment is challenging, non-climate controlled, dirty, hot in the summer, cold in the winter. high turnover in upper management positions. Benefits are relatively decent, people do not take well to change."
good,They are a solid company and pay and treat hourly employees very well.  Management are stretched too thin and micro managed excessively.  Supervisors are not empowered to have flexible decision making and are not given enough support to be successful.  Company makes excellent decisions to position themselves to sustain profitability and do a good job giving back to the community.
good,"- employees not properly recognized."
good,"The hours are really poor.   It is nearly impossible to have a family life and make plans for weekends or holidays.  The rotating shifts are hard on the health and body.   The pay and benefits are top notch, but that is all this company has going for them."
good,"Work is 8 hour shifts with two 15 minute breaks and an hour break after each two hours. It takes about 5-7 minutes just to get to the break room walking from your work station, and if you are late, you most likely will be written up. Co-workers were very friendly, but managers were often angry and rude. Off days usually get taken and you have to come into work each day for a possible two-three weeks straight."
good,I liked working at Boise. People were great. Working conditions were good. It was just the hours and shifts that was hard and the reason for leaving
good,"You work too hard for little pay."
good,Great pay and good benefits but your time is not your own. Lots of mandatory overtime then curtailment without warning. There are unfair policies with time off and sick time. Don't expect any advancement without seniority. Little transparency between operations of the plant and employees. Don't feel like they can always be trusted.
good,"When I started they were recovering from the recession, the culture had changed from a point of making enough sales to keep the business afloat to being the only manufacturer in the region with the resources to make sales.  We took all jobs, we worked 60+ hours a week, down on Sunday morning for PM’ing the machinery and then nonstop.  This allowed a poor Home/Work balance, but the money was there all you had to do was show up and work."
good,"As soon as we go in we stretch get outlet forklift, fill out the inspection sheet. Then we log in into the gun and begin working. The people are great and the job is ok. But there is a lot of over time, can’t leave until the job is done, and there’s is a lot of work in the summer."
good,"The company fails to live up to its ideals on so many fronts. Quality is the standard BC was built on, but in practice it is not lived up to. Production is placed before safety, until someone gets hurt. The staff and administrators tend to view their employees as incompetent regardless of years of service or ability. Your a number at Boise not a Team Member."
good,Boise cascade is not my first choice for a job career or the first choice to recommend someone to. You get ok benefits but feel you do not get enough time off for your sick or injured child.
good,"Hard to advance within the company. Good for a temporary ""stepping stone"" to get where you need to be in life. Not a place to make a career unless there were ways to advance."
good,I have a solid paying job. it is very monotonous and is physically difficult. The environmental conditions in a plywood mill are very poor. I would like to find a less strenuous job.
good,"boise was a great place to work, very competitive in nature. and advancement was fast paced. benefits were awesome, 2nd shift really doesn't work out very well, if you have a family."
good,"Management is very poor and have no integrity, they play favoritism. The benefits are good and they do provide a break room that has a refrigerator with condiments"
good,Was a very cutthroat environment - each in it for themselves so not willing to share information.  Many secrets in tax department.  Other departments?
good,its ok but you do work. i guess it what you make of it. As long as you come to work and do your job you good. Sometimes it gets a little hard when you have down time
good,"I didn't have a hard time working for Boise. A typical day varied job to job, there is always a pre-shift safety meeting before the start of every shift where we discussed any safety issues we noticed while working or walking in. It tended to be fairly hot, though we worked inside so it wasn't all bad."
good,Cool place to work at. Nights was a lot of double work. Days and nights never  communicated with each other. Supervisor had no people skills  they  Will approach you ina different way
good,"It is an easy job with great benefits and flexible schedule. It becomes stressful at times,with the task of performing duties in a timely manner,with safety first and outstanding production.There are various opportunities and chances to learn a lot and contribute to the company."
good,Good balance of work and personal time. Can be very demanding and stressful. Needs a culture change in order to sustain any consistent improvements that are needed
good,i got to work about 2 10 to have a bite to eat attend my pre shift meeting before i go to work take my station an preform job task i learned my job task very well and i learned old an new sheet drops they had installed on line management was iffy a whole lot of new management which due to my discharge from company co workers i really miss they worked with me i worked with them there we many smiles in a work day the hardest part of my job was clean up night management would not assign work areas therefore co works roamed
good,"Basic Production job"
good,I worked here as an in-between job after I graduated. Really nice guys that gave me an opportunity when I needed it. I didn't stay long enough but could see that there was plenty of room for growth.
good,I would recommend people to work there. I would really enjoy the environmental talk with different drivers and learning different task that make the job simple.
good,"The ""life balance vs job work"" ratio are a little out of balance. The hours worked were long so we spent alot of our time away from home and was given very little leeway to take time off."
good,manages trees and forests and produces building materials and paper.  presence in many western states and southeast  few opportunities to log onpublic lands
good,Don't remember enough about to give a good enough review. Plus a lot has changed since I worked there. So my review would render useless to anyone thinking about working there
good,"Got hired by Boise through Protemp Staffing Solutions. I got a call saying that my ""assignment was ended."" With no reason given. Great experience tho."
good,"I was very good typing and placing orders for people.  LOVED the job.  There was a lot of training, and it was very helpful.  I started when they started in the LaSalle area."
good,"Needs to treat everyone equal "
good,longer days fair management good people can be stressful and challenging at times.good benefits and a good life time job if your can handle stressful weather conditions.
good,Very Good work enviornment. Very Hot in the summer and Cold in the winter. Prepare and dress appropriately. Good place to move up on the next level. Really good people there. Open door policy is used frequently and its a very helpful measure in listening to everyones opinions.
good,Descent job in a very very very hot or very very very cold warehouse. Whatever the temperature is on the outside is what you can expect the temperature to be on the inside
good,"Crazy work rotation and hours. typical day at work was ok most of the time. Good coworkers, supervisors was ok. hardest part of job was if the equip was not operating correctly"
good,"Making sure that  your area was clean and safe to start working"
good,"It was nice bouncing around at times, nice change of pace. Was able to work at 5 or 6 different jobs while working at Boise Cascade. It was a union job so things were cut throat at times"
good,"A good place to work with time off , good start pay. The people are nice and fun to work with. Breaks areas and bathroom are clean. The plant is hot there is no climate control."
good,This place was very stale and unmotivated! It has sense closed it's doors. I did however learn proper customer phone technique working there and made some life long friends.
good,"Stuck on a shift and expected to learn material (normal)"
good,"As a employee of Boise Cascade I was able to learn and excel in numerous machines, jobs, and many areas of the plywood industry. As a company they are very safety conscious and fallowed all OSHA requirements."
good,"I was on the phone all day, I had my own cubical. It was a very private place to work. I got along well with other staff members."
good,Salaries at Boise Cascade Medford are low. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. It is a good pace to get some experience.
good,Having never worked in a plywood mill seeing how much they are like sawmills in the way you have to run them.I was able to get the whistle chaser job with in the first 2 mo. of going to work for Bosie Cascade
good,A good place to work. turnover rate is high. the plant has VPP status and is a safe environment. The hardest part of my job is the turnover rate in upper management. we've had in two years two plant mangers and four superintendents.
good,"This was an industrial job that required being exposed to acid, bleach, chlorine and other dangerous chemicals.   The pay was good but the shift work changed every week and the work was very dangerous."
good,Its a good steeping stone job for someone willing to gain experience.
good,"Being a commodity producer, this company was struggling to make a profit and cycled from trying to grow to having to downsize."
good,"Picked / pulled orders, loaded / unloaded trucks. Checked orders for accuracy."
good,"In regards to pay and benefits excellent, type of work and exposure to hazards not so good."
good,This workplace was great to work for in the past. Since the new mangement took over it is not the same place.
good,The most on-hand training I have recieved for any job.
good,"Company offers many positions in the area, drivers, sales, material handlers, admin and management. Good wages for most positions and benefits. New to area so in a learning curve."
good,"Old school culture, many people had been there for twenty plus years."
good,"Typical day at Boise Cascade, 1st we go into pre-shift meeting before we go out to our actual work stations, they are held in a breakroom that is too small for everyone, we get hear about emails the superintendent sent changing different policies and talking bout our downtime on the job.  Then i go to my press and load panels of plywood wood into a hot press."
good,I don't feel that I got the best chance to succeed there. Wish I could get a 2nd chance. I really enjoyed the work.
good,"Very poorly managed. Hard work load.  Unprofessional leads.  Treated poorly. High stress. Upper management horrible.  But,  the people on the floor are usually pretty cool."
good,"A typical day involved research. Looking at data and analyzing it."
good,"good company, was on a great team."
good,I was also able to put to use the training and knowledge that I had learned while working for BCC; I process insurance claims for social security and for private insurance. It was a very demanding job and the work load was tremendous. It was the busiest job I had ever had.
good,"Good place to work, just extremely fast paced. Good managers to help whenever you’re struggling. Good pay for just starting with no experience, and I’m sure there plenty of room for advancement."
good,Good company with good benefits . however I would not recommend to any light weight  straight women . The men hound you! Almost all females there are males .harasssment was a big problem! Very crude men!
good,It's a good place to work with great pay and benefits but slow during winter season. I loved working there but requires Manuel labor and need to drink lots of water.
good,"Everyday we would have our morning meetings to identify what needed to be worked and assign it to a particular team. Once the meeting was over, we would work on the task we were assigned. While working here, I learned different systematic approaches for problem solving. Management was really laid back, however they held you accountable to complete your task. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the heat. Everything else was fine."
good,Make deliveries to all my clients.Learning how to get round in different areas.Bringing in heavy stuff to clients.meeting new peoples and getting done early
good,I loaded and unloaded trucks using a forklift and allocated product by using pickers. I also delivered and installed office furniture to various customers. I learned that it takes a whole team to achieve daily goals and not just an individual. The Management team at Boise was very encouraging and understanding of my personal goals. They new that I was going to school for something different and they were very understanding. The hardest part of job was trying to balance the job and school at the same time. I was working full time during the day and going to school at night. The most enjoyable part of my job was feeling appreciated and at the end of the day knowing my hard work contributed to the success of the company. I also enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,"Let me start by saying Boise Cascade is a decent place to work with great benefits and decent pay. The management in my location is awesome, all the way from the bottom to the top, very easy to talk to and they try to address any problems you may have."
good,It's an okay company to work for. They give you the opportunity to work on the outside of the plant or the inside of the plant. Honestly it's an hard job it's not for everyone.
good,The people i worked with were good hard working people. The management was more cut throught then they needed to be.I worked for Boise for twenty eight years and advanced to many different positions
good,"Work environment was very hot, but co workers were friendly and helpful, work was relatively easy, requiring strong observation skills and quick reflexes. Company puts heavy emphasis on safety and doing things in a methodical safe manner."
good,The hours and employee opinions are not a priority to boise cascade. The company and its management do not follow policy in some cases.  and work conditions are occasionally unsafe.
good,Had to fix equipment that broke down on site. Performed weekly inspections as well as to do services. I learned how to work on new equip and fork lifts. The work place its self is really dirty. The hardest part of the job is some of the heavy lifting that is required
good,Lots of diffrent jobs to work. Never the same thing everyday. Management is not always on the same page with what is going on. Hardest part of the job is the hours you work. Pays good for the area but under paid for the region.
good,The pay was good and the union was good at getting health care and kept the pay at a good level. Just don't do anything that could be taken out of context and just because it was ok with someone else doesn't mean that you can get way with it twice.
good,"Lots of late nights, 12-16 hour days. Not a terrible company by any means but orders could have been pushed threw earlier on the earlier two shifts. Swing shift was responsible for pulling and building orders and loading of trucks to proper scale weights."
good,The matching 401k and pension plan were voted out at the company's request six months after I started there. Those benefits were the main reason I accepted a position with them.
good,"Good company, lots of opportunities for progress but company seems to be attempting to drive the improvement forward. Very safety focused and open to making necessary safety improvements"
good,I left Boise because I wasn't a great salesman. Cold calling customers was not my cup of tea. The pay was decent and hours were good. I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,Awesome company! Need to recalculate the hours worked per employee or compensate for the overtime hours! I work anywhere from 12-20 hr days 5 or 6 days per week!
good,"Was a stressful job but they pay you fair, You just need to keep your job life and your personal life separate if you can do that then you will be okay."
good,"boise was a pretty good job I enjoyed working there. management just was poor, I had too many different supervisors over the course of the years. the benefits were a plus though"
good,a typical day at work is cool until the management come in and think people suppose to be afraid of him. the culture at work is pretty cool. the hardest part at my job is the weather
good,"It is ok place to work at I'm not use to this pace since I came from the oil field industry so it is very different to me. I have learned patience somewhat. management is kind of poor could use help."
good,"Great products, knowledgeable staff, great clients and vendors."
good,"okay company to work for however if you are at a satellite location you'll will be bored to death and honestly i don't see how the one i was at stayed open not enough work to keep us busy to the point where i would spend entire shifts doing nothing not a good sign i don't want to invest my time into a location that will probably go nowhere, At least you are guaranteed 40hrs  a week  regardless of work being available or not so you'll still make money, Now one thing i absolutely did not understand you had to be outside in your assigned area at all time regards of work load even when you are doing ABSOLUTELY nothing  & in the dead of winter that Blows."
good,This place has great shift managers and plant management. The workers are good spirited and hard working too. However there is a lot of layoffs and curtailments based on the housing market.
good,This mill has been closed for 20 years now. It was a great place and close to home. I honestly thought I would retire from there. I'm sure there are still many Boise Cascade locations around.
good,Boise by far as of my resume had to bed the busiest job I have done.The position I acquired at the time was operating a Cat 950. The Cat 950 is basically a heavy equipment machine that is like a huge forklift. The forks on the machine are designed to carry loads of logs to be processed and lathed for plywood.
good,I enjoyed want I did there it but if the supervisor and you was cool it like they where out  to get you. I had got a job as the assistant line tender and waiting to be moved .Then I had a death in the family my nephew died and I was trying to help my sister rise up money to bury him and my wife was in the hospital at the same time. I signed in the wrong sit to come in early and came in at my regular time and he said I suppose to came in early and he suspended me and said it was job abandonment
good,Competitive field to work in. Safety is paramount with continuous training. There are many opportunities to advance with the company. The benefits and pay are satisfactory to the work load. I started with the company not knowing anything about the job I was to preform and learned the ins and outs of manufacturing plywood.
good,"Safety is always first, but when the turn over rate is as high as ours you have new hires training new hires, not a good practice. There are so many people that are new to their position most of the jobs are not done properly as per the SOP's. This makes for upset conditions for the whole place. When you approach management with concerns they are mostly not dealt with. I've never worked at a place with morale as poor as this facility."
good,"A typical work day at boise cascade was very unpredictable, aggressive and time sensitive. Due to the fact, the job was shipping and receiving."
good,I operate two heavy equipment machines which are called a block saw and a 950. I used these machine to cut wood to make plywood. The hardest part about this job is the heavy lifting and the heat/cold. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay and the people.
good,"great place to work, co-workers were very nice, only down fall "
good,Fast paced work environment. Pay was great and they offered really good benefits.
good,"I answered the phones and kept all mail organized. I learned how to keep up with work load and having customer service. A typical day is to arrive at work, clock in and start the phones. The hardest part of the job is knowing it was temporary work."
good,"shipping and receiving"
good,"Bi-weekly payroll processing, daily duties entering job data changes, calculating payroll adjustments."
good,great territory and fantastic benefits
good,A good company to work for but hard to make a good living at. I still talk to some of these people today.
good,Its a good place to work.theres just to much dust and sometimes can become troublesome. If you can work over that its a good place to work. Not much room to move up but the pay is good
good,"Boise Cascade is a great company to work for if you are interested in having the same job for several years.  There is a lot of turnover in the manual labor positions, but not much in management, so the room for advancement is very slim."
good,Fast paced wholesale building materials distribution focusing on employees and customers.  Employees are treated as part of the team.Able to manage the location as fit for the demographic area.
good,"great company, paid lunches, great benefits overall good company to work with company had great hourly pay and would buy dinners every 3 months"
good,"Good company to work for, profitable, good employees. Company gave me a start in supervising with future opportunities!"
good,"Most entry level positions are well payed, starting at $13 per hour for probation, then minimum 16.50 for lowest level job plus benefits. The jobs are almost all repetitive and tedious, but easy, which is to be expected of entry level production jobs. They also tend to be long physical hours, and very few days aren't spent sore outside of work. Co-workers are usually ready to help anyone, new or old, and most are very friendly. Management has always been nice in my observation, although I have heard stories of aggression and pressure. They do put a high point on safety, with paid monthly safety meetings, and swift action for safety violations."
good,Great company and exciting day to day work environment. Management was very supportive. Co workers worked diligently together for a common goal.
good,"People at boise cascade are good kind people,work attitude is fine,neat old mill to visit.management is ok they try hard to work with employees on every."
good,"My job was competitive and fast paced.  I was always cautious that I was working with dangerous equipment.  I enjoyed the people I worked with, and I was glad to work for my supervisor."
good,I believe that as far as the family based environment by far it has been one of the best companies I have ever worked for. I only wished that it was a more stable place of employment because I wish to be somewhere I can retire from.
good,"Co-workers are a great part of this company. "
good,"Loved working here, benifits and progressive pay but long hours and shift work also had a big lay off so not much job security yet I would definatly go back to work here."
good,"Went to work in the dark, and came home in the dark. Not much more to tell."
good,There were Nationwide personnel cutbacks. I left the Company before this occurred.
good,"I know it's not a political correct term but it is the most fitting:""Too many chiefs and not enough Indians""."
good,"This was a office position where I used my computer experience and customer service abilities. I was responsible for the eCommerce sales and customer training of the Fortune 500 company customers. I served as the liaison between external customers and internal departments concerning all eBusiness. I provided support fot the sales team in their efforts to gain new business and maintain existing customer accounts. There was 25 percent travel which kept the position exciting, along with lots of customer training. The company Headquarter's management was good and a this was enjoyable job experience. The company was sold."
good,Good company to work for. good benefits 1st shift was great and overtime was available on occasion
good,"Good place to work, if one does not have a problem with, factory/mill work, great benefits and upper-management tries to stay-tuned with its employees.  Big on safety, great benefits, good pay."
good,Its not a bad gig and one can definitely retire from it. Good place to go without any college degree. The only issue is you have no idea when the day ends. Could be 9 to 1700 or 9 to whenever. Can be strenuous work.
good,Work at Boise Cascade in the distribution side and its a steady place to work with very flexible daily tasks.  Can feel overwhelming from time to time but all around a decent place to work.
good,It’s a great place to work they are fair with the employees and make everyone feel welcome as long as they are conducting themselves in a becoming manner
good,"Do your job, stay focused on safety of yourself and others at all times. maje sure proper PPE is worn at all times, ( personal protective equipment). stay alert!"
good,"loved the job, very consistent, management changed half way through my time there, didn't care for the replacement manager, i thought she was immature, she openly made fun of several employees, clicks are high here, get in the group or stay an outsider. No availability for moving up with out an education  if you start at reception, benefits are great."
good,Loved working there very fast pace learning to load trucks and balancin the trailors so they even out exspecially the ones that have more then one stop we had a real great team i learned alot quick exspecially loading management really never had a clue about certain things some people were not treated well never had concrete evidence on anything they decided pooru judges of characteri like the shift we helped each other like a team should we aint togetheri learned different materials l learned how to move 60 feet LvL's li learned to load a truck like a puzzle with multiple stops some people dont get enough time to learn.the system they do alot of inhouse hiring and promotions if your gonna work you have to pay attention make sure management is on point and your team is ax team and try not to drop any lumber youl picking it up by your self repackaging it so becareful i dont know what else to say oh they do have over 30 places in the usa so you can move if you wanted too and it can get real buisy just be prepared each shifts does different things1st unloads and loads that didnt get done and stack 2nd cuts to order set s your load to get picked by 3rd shift 3rd pretty much loads and clean and sometimes unload if we have too
good,"Overall Boise was a good place to work. The pay was very good for the area due to being in a union. The benefit package was very good."
good,"I really worked there. I was at Boise Cascade for almost 8 years."
good,"It was a great company to work, grow and learn with.  The few levels of management always made new ideas and new solutions easier to finalize and facilitate.  The internal and external exposure to companies, products, technologies and strategies in the building materials industry is second to none."
good,"Worked for Boise from 1991 to 2015 in two states, Maine and Alabama. Retired in 2015 in order to start an inshore fishing business. My children are grown (for the most part) The company is very people intensive and I was treated well. Lots of benefits and good pay."
good,"Boise Cascade is a strong company that is making good business decisions. Some aspects of the company lag behind in the progression towards better technology and practices, but upper management is working to improve these issues. It is not an exciting industry to work in, except perhaps in the engineered wood products mills."
good,"Relaxed atmosphere"
good,"this is a good place to work, its a challenge every day and thats what i like about it ... having time off is the only dislike i have about it"
good,"Great desk spaces -"
good,"I was terminated due to an error in judgement.  Other than that, this was a good place to work."
good,"Management is very good for business, not so great for employee's.  They are very 2 sided, one side to your face, the other side behind your back"
good,It like any other job you have your good days and your bad days it not so much of a hard job you can get very dirty good pay the manager are straight at times depends on how the job running but other then it a job somebody got to do it
good,this job is alright at times not the best as long the machinery is having a good day and don't have to fight it me and my coworkers work together safely
good,Management is nothing but helpful on graveyard. Pay was 15/hour starting out 19 after 90 days and 21 for a rated job on the lower end. Driving hyster for them can be stressful. Overall pretty fast paced. One of the better benefits in the area.
good,Great place to work if you don't mind the weather management leaves you alone as long as your working. Leads cry about everyone except themselves no one picks up after themselves and management really doesn't care just blow smoke about discipline
good,"It could be hard work but you feel like what you do is important to the company. "
good,Boise Cascade provided a good work life balance. The time off was pretty good. The management team is very supportive. The benefits are decent. Overall a good place to work.
good,"Daily forklift checklist and safety check sheet is to be completed. Going over safety or any other concerns or disagreements with your crew. Start your job to get your quota done and complete. When your done,help others that need help."
good,"I worked for Boise for about 25 years in a couple different locations. Very good company to work for. Paper industry slowed due to the use of less paper. Competition the smaller companies less valuable, closing most of the facilities in the northwest."
good,It’s a great paying job and has awesome benefits. You can work as much overtime as you want to make more money. You get paid every two weeks but you checks are usually really good!
good,Kept you on your toes as you had to constantly feed the dryer and drink lots of water. I learned how to feed the dryer. It was hard work and liked the people I worked with.
good,"days where busy "
good,"I shouldn't have resigned. I enjoyed working every 3 to 4 days but after a 48 hours shift per week, it wears on the body, which causes more errors and a safety issue."
good,"Driver truck, pick up and/or make deliveries! Learned some of the inter workings of a paper mill! Direct management was great! The most enjoyable part of job was being home every weekend!"
good,"for the time that I worked with Boise Cascade ,it was interesting ,kind of an every day challenge ,never the same pattern ,overall a good company to work for."
good,Boise Cascade is a good company for someone looking for a long term career. Great benefits and flexibility. They work with your schedule if something comes up. Pay well too
good,"Large fast paced environment, lots of jobs available and room for movement within company.  Many departments to work in, working with a team or in a group there's plenty to keep busy."
good,Good company to work for good compensation and benefits friendly people good training to do you job changed from contract saes to retail sales growing
good,The days went by quickly due to the fast pace of the work. I enjoyed the people that I worked with. I got to learn how to use equipment I had not seen before.
good,Typical day at work would be building roof trusses. Jumping up and down off machines and using a tape measure to ensure the right measurements on the trusses. Work with great people and the job pays well just a hard physical job to do.
good,"This is a good place to work as for as money goes. It will definitely keep you there but whatever the temp is outside, that's what it is on the inside!!"
good,"I enjoyed the mental challenge of time management. I was not enamored of the physical nature of loading presses, but applied myself to work smart and safe first before over exerting myself. I eventually learned to enjoy getting physical as needed, being careful to stay in the moment and not think ahead more than one or two tasks at a time, concentrating on the task at hand until accomplished"
good,Managed a variety of functions: call center; order processing; accounts receivable and accounts payable.  Need to coordinate activities with sales and warehouse departments.
good,the people are really friendly and make sure you understand what you job is. they also make sure your training and skills are on point.
good,How to do dryer maintance learn about wood the workers are all great and maagement is great will help u with ant thing u need help with the hardest part is the part when your ready to go and five till they tell u some called in and u have to stay
good,"A typical day is spent almost entirely trying to sell construction materials to potential customers. At Boise, I have learned to build rapport with all types of people, both co-workers and customers. The hardest part of my job is selling to customers who's businesses have been hurt during this economic slump. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help customers with their needs by providing products that benefit their company."
good,Lots of different technology to play with; however it's easy to get pigeon holed here.
good,This job was very good I always had a consistent route. Always had positivity and great communication. Would recommend this job to anyone who would want to learn about curtain or flat bed work.
good,Overall pleasant work culture when the few bad apples are not disruptive to productivity of all other associates directly or indirectly. Good management and leaders always keeping workers wanting to be productive. Work environment is set up to try and keep the worker happy and well accommodated to do a given job safely and proficiently.
good,"Great place to work, paid well, great supervisors to work for, they could have a better time off accumulation system. Good camaraderie amongst coworkers. They need a better corrective training plan after write ups."
good,"great coworkers,  great pay with an ability to grow as a individual, also as a team member. Very high on safety and quality of not only the people but also the product."
good,Overall Boise cascade is a pretty good job that pays good money  you will have to work once you come in the building at a steady pace but overall they take care of you
good,"Road warrior. Good communication within the company. Great support team. Being a national company, they are open to relocation within their branches. Great team atmosphere."

Hardest part of the job - getting product to extremely rural areas. Enjoyed processing orders and gaining business relationships with clients.
good,Boise Cascade was good to me while I work there. They demonstrate their care for safety and also for customer satisfaction. I had a problem with one new manager that came in but other than that it was a wonderful experience. Especially give a kudos to the human resource team.
good,"It's a great company for what it's for.  It's cold when it's cold and it's very hot when it is hot, but they are very serious about safety.  Yes they want to get the plywood product and in large quantity, but they want to ensure you are doing it safe."
good,"I worked at Boise Cascade for fifteen years and really enjoyed my time at the company.  I worked on the floor for about 10 years and performed numerous jobs before moving into a supervisory role. "
good,Boise was a fast paced and sometimes stressful work environment but there was room to grow and they offered great benefits. Boise is a great company to work for if you are willing to show up and work every day.
good,"They would be excellent if they paid more since there's lack of career advancement. "
good,"With in the 4 years that I was employed with Boise Cascade, from day one my skills and work ethic was seen and utilized for me and for production. I was recruited for safety training programs which then made me a safety team member. Also was trained for all mobile equipment and was train to operate all machines in the dry end department and green end, ut center. I was then recruited to step in as a relief foreman for the green end, ut center and on the dry end when needed. When needed as well because of my diesel mechanic experience on down days( maintenance day) I would assistant Mill Wrights with the repair to the machinery on the green end. In all, working at Boise cascade helped me broaden  my knowledge and help me gain promotions and achievements."
good,This place was great to me since the first day I walked threw the door they gave me a great opportunity and it was just one of those jobs I liked doing since day 1
good,If you're young and need to make a decent income this a great job for you. It's very hard work but it definitely teaches you how to work with a team and get a set goal done. Not for the faint of heart though.
good,working with others on a daily basis gives you a security that your place is safe and others are watching your back as well as you watching theirs. good opportunity to learn things applied to your position.
good,I started working for them out of collage. They were very progressive with their training. I was in their management class and was shown many phases of the business.
good,loved working there but my shift wasnt right for my family schedule. wish i could have stayed they have great benefits pay was decent always had what i needed to do my work

good,Overall a great place to work. There is plenty of room for advancement and you make a great income. Everyone works well together. It is not easy work though. You will EARN your money but it's very rewarding.
good,Great environment and people to work with. Not much chance for advancement as a Co-Op but I felt like I would advance rapidly if hired full-time. Good pay and helpful management willing to teach.
good,"The work day starts at 5 a.m. We make sure that the trimmers are working and that it's cleared of debris. I mark out the common lumber from the shop lumber. common lumber is used for windows, and doors and construction purposes. Th emanagement is goo. they try to help employees whenever possible. The most difficult times at work involve back ups and breakdowns. The problems are solved quickly to keep the mill running. But it is all done in a safely manner. I enjoy the the bond between the co workers and the supervisors and the rest of management."
good,A typical day at work would be making sure all loads got cover and loaded properly. In the past 4 years I learned how to be doing 4 job duties at ones while being in the phone with truck drivers or supervisors. I dealt with work drivers and owner operator drivers with their request on loads. The work setting was a very easy place to adjust. The most stressful part of the job was making sure every load got cover no matter if it was in the beginning of work or end while dealing where the destination was. Best part of working with boise was keeping myself busy so time will go fast.
good,The place is not bad at all to work at. It just depends on you and the Department you work in. Ive been here for almost 2yrs and i don't have any complaints . The mill isnt stressful in my opinion . I would recommend working here
good,Excellent place to work. The managers take the time to get to know their employees. They also have a grooming process to prepare selected employees for greater positions inside the company.
good,"The pay for the quality of work that you do at Boise Cascade is phenomenal! I loved every second minus the fact that you started work before the sun rose ha ha. All in all, great job."
good,The best place to work thus far in my life.  Was there for 10 years.  Had to start at the bottom and work up.  I had fork lift experience and eventually got in that job.  Loaded trucks and offloaded units as they came off production line.  The mill was union so I was paid very well.  Benefits were ok.  401 was good.
good,"Typical day at work is pretty basic, just get your work done, quality is important. Pretty heavy work load some days but manageable. Good people to work with. Very family friendly, whenever my kids were sick, no questions asked i was able to leave work and pick them up. Monday through Friday 7 am to 4 pm."
good,"Loaded and unloaded semi trucks with building materials using a forklift.  Kept the grounds clean and free of debris.  "
good,"Great benefits, Good managers, Great people, Room for advancement, Stable work. Co workers always willing to help. Supervisor very understand and willing to work alongside. Can be very demanding at times witch makes the days seem short. Great job security."
good,Love this place especially the People.  That is what I miss the most is the people that worked there had a good friend relationship with a lot of people.
good,"Great place to work. Plenty of time off for family. Good management,  Great benefits, and competitive compensation pay. I wish that I hadn't been laid off because i will miss that place."
good,"A good days work, Fun, and enjoyable. There are many opportunities working there. You get to learn a good bit about engineered wood products. There are many machines you can learn. It is a all around a great place to work."
good,Boise Cascade no longer exist.  Company merged with OfficeMax which then later was bought out by Office Depot.
good,"Good atmosphere, good pay, good insurance, management cares about your health, happiness, attitude. "
good,"A typical day at work included maintenance, preventive maintenance, and trouble shooting on various electrical, electrical, hydraulic, computer(PLC), and instrument systems.  I was trained using Allen-Bradley PLC systems, which was used in control of the plant operation.  My co-workers performed as a team, always assisting each other to resolve any issue.  The hardest part of the job was the environment in which the work was performed."
good,"The person they have ""training"" me is not training me. They contradict themselves about what is ok and what isnt, just walk off from the machine without saying anything, then get mad and yell when something goes wrong."
good,Operate heavy equipment is checked for problems and then fueled and minor repairs are done. Operated heavy equipment for 18 years and before that I was a laborer that operated bobcats and forklifts. My co-workers were hard to work with because they were negittive about the company and didn't seem to care what happen to it and enventially caused the shutdown. Working with negitve people was the hardest part of my job and I enjoyed operating heavy equipment was satifying.
good,The challenges developing a greenfield workforce offered unforgettable experiences. Working through employee training and development on machinery they were unfamiliar with will define the managers temperament for employee building skills.
good,Great company. Awesome crew. Great pay. Very flexible. Never a dull moment always something to do. You can advance pretty quickly.
good,Everyday had a different challenge. the team work combined with some exceptional employees allowed this facility to be world class.
good,"Primary responsibility included working in the collections department."
good,"Very supportive company to work for. I enjoyed working for this company very much. I liked working with my customers in this field."
good,Working in a paper mill for 15 years had a lot of growth in my life. I started as a helper on the machines and finished as a production coordinator.
good,I had to answer the multi line phone calls. And transfer to correct salesmen or personnel.
good,"Management wasn't great, even if you had a better way they still wanted it their way or highway, didn't like the Union, sometimes a buddy buddy system"
good,I love working at Boise but hours and no time off was main key.. Wish could've had some time off but overall it's a gud place to work.. The people and some of supervisor was very friendly and would help u if u don't know something r point u in rite directions if they don't know
good,"Typical day at work just get ready to adapt to the weather because it was always 15 degrees hotter in the plant than the temperature outside. Things I've learned are how to work under pressure, how to operate a fork lift, it built me up to be able to work in any plant environment, and also on a daily basis we would go over safety. The management to me was ok. I had a great relationship with Co-Workers from the Plant Manager to the Supervisors all the way to the Employees they hated to see me go. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the heat. Most enjoyable part of the job was being around my co-workers they were like my extended family."
good,"Lots of travel and always a new problem to solve."
good,This is a great company but management suck. The moral here is non existent. It would be great if they could get management to get their act together but even calling corporate does nothing.
good,The company used to be the go to place to work for family wage jobs.  Recently with the sale of some of their facilities it is getting more scary to stay.
good,Management was very carrying and fair. Everyone seemed to get along well and worked well as a team. They crossed trained us with different departments so we could better ourselves therefore giving us what we needed to work with customers.
good,Boise Cascade is a really good company to work for but it does have its ends where its just to much on people to work there. Making Plywood is extremely overbearing and its too hot in the work place for people to be constantly going and going even though they did give breaks but not long enough breaks.
good,"typical day was long"
good,"The comparison of this position to other positions is that there are no typical days, so it is key to be nimble and bendable.  Management is ridged and often not willing to adopt an innovative idea,  The workplace culture is chummy within departments however outside the clique it is difficult to feel part of the larger team objective. The hardest part of the job was being challenged to continually reinvent new and engaging content to make most attendees achieve maximum understanding of materials presented.  Love the collaboration with teams of people to design a themed national meeting, through the ""storming-norming & forming phases of a project or campaign development,,"
good,"Great oppurtunity for advancement, training, and apprentices. If you get a chance apply."
good,"This was an older plant, but the employees took pride in meeting or sometimes beating industry standards with the outdated equipment. I enjoyed the camaraderie."
good,"One of the best jobs I ever had, good hours, leaders benefits, pay, overall great experience, best insurance ever, bonuses, vacation, nothing bad to say about this company"
good,"Great place, hard work, very demanding and work load is heavy. Glad I had the opportunity to work there. Left because I was offered a position I could not refuse back in a field I had left."
good,"Again, when you choose to work for a company, it is your decision if you decide to keep the job or quit the job. I worked as a customer service representative and a Receptionist. I enjoyed it."
good,"Pick pack and ship enviroment. Receive freight and put away. team meetings. Corporate training,  "
good,"Great place to work! Most of my experience in plywood came from my time at Boise cascade.  Had good training from good people. Learned many skills both life ,and work."
good,"Great place, Can make a lot of money in production, good teams to work with, many different types of personalities. I was a member of the safety committee and was able to go to many of the plants and meet many people. Opportunity for growth is all in your own hands."
good,"The are great to work for but need better training programs. Great benefits all the way around.  They do care about employee safety. Can't find people to work there because you have to pass a hair follicle drug test, background check and pre-employment physical fitness test.  So most people that apply fail one of them."
good,this company is overall a great place to work at and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a career with Boise Cascade i enjoy the people and work with and the strong safety atmosphere is great.
good,"Great company to work for.  Low stress and wonderful people to achieve goals with.  Competitive, market driven environment, gave me an opportunity to learn and advance my skills."
good,"consistent work,  always new information to acquire, open door policy with management, coworkers respectful of each other, "
good,"Transport of goods and services via a local network of vendor."
good,"When I came to Boise Cascade they gave me the opportunity to be productive in life! I am greatly to be employed at Boise Cascade! It has a very nice management and safety team! There are multiple opportunities available for promotion! I started out at 12.69on a 90 day probation period, then went to $16.07 as a utility! Then I became a Clipper Oper. 17.51, now a Vat Outfeed Oper.18.84! Last yr I made $50,000! So Boise Cascade is a place of opportunities!"
good,"Foi uma grande empresa, pagava bons salários na época, qualquer um era capaz de iniciar a compra de sua casa e automóveis com o salário que recebia, o serviço era braçal, ao fim da semana de trabalho nós estávamos cansados e pegávamos os ônibus dormindo, isso não era ruim, era bom, pois era um cansado muito bom, os benefícios e planos de saúde era ótimo..."
good,"boise is a great place to work if you like to make money and are willing to work hard. The pay is great. Alot of hours at times, but worth it. Safety is number one at Boise. great opportunity for advancement."
good,"Atypical day at work would consist of getting up at 3am and reviewing delivery manifest then loading my truck for the days deliveries. Then planning out my route for the quickest and safest way to make my deliveries and returns."
good,"Good company to work for, upper management is very appreciative of the workers, lower management is uneducated and egotistical. The benefits are awesome along with the huge company parties and  1 bonus a year"
good,Boise Cascade is a company with an extremely aggressive pay scale and top notch health insurance and 401k benefits. Recommend highly!
good,"I learned the importance of managing my time, organizing to do daily tasks in a timely manner, meeting deadlines, and paying attention to detail."
good,"A great job with fantastic pay and benefits.  Some management issues, but what company does not have them?  Overall great family wage job located in a rural area."
good,"It's been awhile, but BCC taught so much. I pretty much grew up there, hired at 19 years old, and started with a job in word processing working at nights while I went to school during the day. I found my best friends there, and to this day, they are still my best friends. I left as an HR Coordinator after working there over 20 years."
good,Teamwork and loyalty to the company is the hallmark of this organization. Most upper management have been with the company for 20+ years and operate as a conhesive unit. Ability to run lean and mean is a necessity and proven an effect way to produce excellent financial results.
good,"A busy atmosphere with numerous inbound and outbound trucking. The safety culture was top notch. Next to safety customer service was extremely important. It was common that upper management delivered a positive message and willingness to help out when needed. This was the most demanding but most appreciated job by the people that worked under me. Corporate, from HR, Safety Coordinator and our top director of the company were top notch. I left with very fond memories."
good,we had safety meeting everyday to help keep safety at the forefront of everything we did. the hardest part of the job for me was the long hours most of the time i was there we worked 7 12 hour shifts
good,there is always something new coming in you are never wokring on the same thing for more then two days you are always learning and experiencing new things. Also have to think a head and be able to read a set of plans which will grow fast with this company.
good,"Great benefits, very professional work environment. Clear business goals and methods in which to go after them. Very secure company with reasonable ability to advance."
good,I learned how to use a computerized phone system. Meeting new people everyday. Great Holiday Parties. I had some awesome Co-workers.

good,"I really enjoyed working for Boise Cascade, I would recommend this company to anyone. The co-workers are all great and my manager, I thought was a good manager; very understanding. I didn't have any difficulty with any part of my job or the company. They could have distributed the work load more evenly but all in all it was good."
good,For the area I live in they have blessed me with a career that I can provide for my family and opportunity to grow. Definitely the best place I have worked at.
good,"Highly motivated work environments, good people to work alongside, worked pretty intensive at times, really appreciated my job, learned a lot from there."
good,"Enjoyed the time here covering a large area of the country.  Sold production from the mill to distributors and manufacturers.  Set own schedule, worked with distributor reps in field as well"
good,"With most of the jobs in the area being minimum wage, this is the best opportunity for a career in the area. The pay is good, the work is decent and they care about employee safety."

good,"Great opportunities and management. Enjoyed working there. Hard job, but enjoyed it."
good,Tracking receiving and shipping orders on computer.  Working with warehouse associates by monitoring incoming orders and outgoing orders.  Working as a team to ensure warehouse maintained daily operations in effective manner.  Hardest part of job keeping orders filled and day to day operations running smoothly.

good,Challenging work balancing all the bank accounts for all the divisions of Boise Cascade.Very rewarding work.
good,"Physical work for at least the first 90 days which makes most people sore. Starting good pay which gets even better when you get a position. Most benefits don't start until you put in your first 90 days. All encounters in every department I meet good people. This is one of the best safety oriented companies in the state. Everyone is in good spirits and work well as a team. Management is fair to all. New hires mostly clean tools, floors, wrap end product, and take care of the scrap pieces of wood."

good,"I enjoyed my 13 years with Boise Cascade / OfficeMax and Office Depot very much. I gained so much understanding and knowledge about our business, system programs and operations from management, IT, our Wholesaler's and 3rd Party vendor's and  coworkers daily For which I'm very thankful and I remain friends with many of them even after the office closing in Naperville."
good,Great company to work for and a great opportunity to help people. Handled benefits questions from hourly to salaried employees;  Sales people to Mill Foremen; office people to truck drivers; It was a really interesting mix and not difficult to handle.
good,"Work hours were flexible, but only 8 hours a day required. To start, there were only about three major responsibilities. Over a very short period of time I took on a lot more responsibility finding ways to occupy my time and be productive. Because everyone in the mill is always running and working hard, it makes it easy to want to do the same. My co-workers were wonderful, immediately made me feel welcomed and were always a huge help when there was something I did not understand. "

good,"Everyday was a challenge, Boise was one of the leading office supply company in the USA.   I  called customers who was 30 to 60 days behind on their account for payment.

Whatever it took.  the hard part was getting a permanent position."

good,"My 24+ year with the company, previously named Boise Cascade Office Products, then OfficeMax/Office Depot, could not have been topped.  The company has always cared about employees and  advancement was there for those that wished to work for it.   Had restructure of the company not resulted in the elimination of my position locally, I would have enjoyed working there until mandatory-retirement!"
good,"I would start work at 10:20 to 6:20 we worked 8 hour a day I learned to work with other, if there was a problem I would call a lead person and they would always help. The hardest part of the job was the lay up line. I leaned alot and made good friends."
good,"I was incredibly blessed and grateful to be accepted into this position .  At the time I was employeed by Boisie they were the number 1 office supply company worldwide.  they found my through a head hunter tht would not give up when I said I wasn't interested and Im so glad they did not.  It was the best learning experience, and the people in this organization are the most professional and kind people of any industry I have ever been a part of.

good,"A typical work day in the customer service department was always ""buzzing"" with excitement. The busy office seemed to make the day go by quickly. There is always a reward of satisfaction when helping customers with their office product needs and issues. I always felt like I was learning new things about products and the office supply business. The management was fair and caring of their customers, as well as their employees. I loved working for Boise Cascade Office Products. I have retained what I have learned from working at Boise. I have maintained long lasting relationships with many of my co-workers over the years."
good,This was a great company and very stable. I would go back again.
